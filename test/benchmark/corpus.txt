PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.

N presenting this book to our patrons, we think it fitting to state that the
publication of such a vohune was first suggested to us by two ladies who
have been since, for most of the time, closely associated with us in its com-
pilation — Mrs. Mary A. Stimpson and Miss Mary E. Elliot. Their labors
have been ably supplemented in this department and otherwise by Mrs. Martha S. Hoyt
and others, to all of whom we owe a debt of thanks for faithful and efficient service. Our
thanks are also due in high measure to Miss Mary H. Graves for her thorough and pains-
taking work in connection with the editorial department and the verification of the geneal-
ogies herein contained ; and to Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, the editor-in-chief, for her many
wise suggestions, careful oversight, and valuable personal contributions of biographical
matter. That the completion of the work has been delayed somewhat beyond the time
at first anticipated has been due partly to the fact that the data for some of the biog-
raphies, promised a long time since, were not furnished to us until quite recently, and
also to the careful and thorough manner in which every department of the work has been
carried on. That all will be fully satisfied we do not expect ; yet we believe that our
subscribers in general will find little real cause for dissatisfaction, and in particular will
this be true of those who readily and heartily co-operated with us in the preparation of
their own biographies. The few who failed to do so will be httle entitled to complain of
any errors or omissions in the matter personal to themselves herein printed. We believe
the book will fulfil the reasonable expectations of all those who have taken a friendly
interest in its pubhcation.

EDITOR'S PREFACE.




HE Ijiogiaphical sketches presented in this vohune are mostly (j1' an
are still with us ami engaged in active pursuits which embrace
variety of callings. The woman minister, doctor, lawyer, all have her"
record, and with them the writer, the teacher, the philanthropist, the general care-;
society.

The sketches naturally vary in importance and interest ; bnt, taken all together, t:
offer a laudable report of the work of New F^ngland women in many departments &lt;
pubhc and personal service. They attest the active interest of New England's daughtei
in the welfare of the State and in all that most vitally concerns its citizens.

ELIZABETH C. AGASSIZ



BIOSRAPHIGAb.




ELIZABETH CARY AGASSIZ,

the first President of Radcliffe
College and its constant bene-
factress, is destined, through
the scholarship that bears her
name and the hall which is
to be erected in her honor on
the college grounds, to be held in grateful,
lasting remembrance as a pioneer advocate
and promoter in the nineteenth century of
the higher education of women. In former
years, as the wife and helpmeet of a naturalist
of world-wide reputation, and later as the
editor of his Life and Correspondence, she was
well known in literary and scientific circles.
Her subsecjuent work as an educational leader
brought her name more directly before the
public; and the celebration in Decembei', 1902,
in Sanders Theati'e, Cambridge, of the eightieth
anniversary of her l)irth was widely reportetl
in the papers as an occasion of general interest.
Born in Boston, December 5, 1822, daughter
of Thomas Graves and Mary (Perkins) Cary,
she comes of long lines of New England ancestry,
and personally bears witness to gentle blood
and breeding. Her father, Thomas Graves
Cary, A.M. (Harv. Coll. ISll"), was son of
Sanmel^ and Sarah (Gray) Cary and grandson
of Saniuel'* anil Margaret (Graves) Cary, all of
Chelsea, Mass. His grandfather, Sanmel'* Cary,
was descended from' James' Cary, of Charles-
town, through Jonathan^ and Samuel.^ James'
Cary came from England and settled in
Charlestown in 1639. He was the seventh son
of William Cary, who was Mayor of the city
of Bristol, England, in 1611.

SanuieP Cary, A.M., born in 1713, was grad-
uated at Harvard College in 1731. He became
a sea-captain, making long voyages. He mar-



ried in 1741 Margaret Graves, daughter of
Thomas' Graves, of Charlestown (Harv. Coll.
1703), Judge of the Superior Court; grand-
daughter of Dr. Thomas^ Graves (Harv. Coll.
1656); and great-grand-daughter of Thomas'
Graves, who settled in Charlestown about 1637,
was master of various vessels, and at the time
of his death, in 1653, was a Rear- Admiral in
the Engli.sh navy.

Mary Perkins, wife of Thomas G. Cary and
mother of Elizabeth, was a daughter of Colonel
Thomas Handasyd Perkins, merchant and phi-
lanthropist of Boston (born 1764, died 1854),
who in 1833 gave his estate on Pearl Street to
be the seat of the school for the blind taught
by Dr. Sanmel G. Howe. This act of public-
spiritetl generosity is commemorated in the
name which the school — now in South Boston,
marvellously increased in size and eciuipment —
bears to this day, "The Perkins Institution
and Massachusetts School for the Blind."
Colonel Perkins was also a liberal contributor
to the funds of the Massachusetts General
Hospital, the Mercantile Library Association,
and the Boston Athenanmi, and a helper of
many other worthy causes. One of his sisters
was the wife of Benjamin Abbot, IjL.D., for
fifty years })rincipal of Phillips Exeter Acad-
emy; another, Margaret, wife of Ralph Bennett
Forbes and mother of tlie late Hon. John
Murray Forbes, of Milton. Tliey were childi-en
of James and Elizabeth (Peck) Perkins, and
doubtless inherited some of their sterling traits
of character from their mother, who, early left
a willow, showed herself a woman of "great
capacity in b\isiness matters" and a friend to
the needy, t'olonel Perkins was named for his
maternal giandfather, Thomas Handasyd Peck.
His paternal grandparents were Eilnmnd and



RErRESKNTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Esther f (Frcifhingliain) IVi'kins, tlio former,
son of Captain Kdimmd Perkins, the first of
the family to settle in Boston (in the latter
jxart of the seventeenth centvuy). Colonel
Perkins married the daughter of Simon Elliott,
of Boston, and had two sons — Thomas H., Jr.,
and deorge C. — and five daughters.

Elizabeth Cabot Cary (nf&gt;\v ^Irs. Agassiz)
was educated at home, pur.suing her studies
under the direction of a governess. She was
one of a family of seven children. Her younger
brother, Richard Cary, Captain of Company
G, Second Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry,
commissioned May 24, ISGl, fell, mortally
wounded, in the battle of Cedar Mountain, "N'a.,
August 9, 1862. Her elder sister, Mary Louisa,
who married Cornelius C. Felton (President of
Harvard University 1S60-02), died in 1S64,
having survived her huslmnd two years.

In the spring of 1850 Elizabeth C. Cary be-
came the wife of Louis Agassiz, profes,sor of
zoology and geology in Harvard University,
and went with him to his house in Oxford
Street, Cambridge, to make a home for him
and his son and the two daughters soon to
come from Switzerland, and "to be," as said
his biogra]ilier, Mr. Marcou, writing years after,
" the guardian angel of Louis Agassiz and his
whole family of children and grandchildren."
Mrs. Agassiz not oidy directed willi discretion
the affairs of her household, Init interested
herself in natural history and particularly in
zoological studies, and .served as her husband's
secretary and literary a.ssistant, taking copious
notes of his lectures and preparing manuscript
for the printer.

unwearied teacher, rarely eciualled in enthu-
sia.sm and fitness for his vocation. Professor
Agassiz, as everybody knows, had " no time
to spare to make money." His salary, how-
ever, fell far short of enabling him to meet
both domestic and scientific expenses. Hence
the establishment in 1855 (the idea originating
with his wife) of the Agassiz School for young
ladies, which had a prosperous existence of
eight years, its pupils, attracted by the fame



of the great naturalist, coming from near and
from far. The elder Agassiz children, Alexander
and Ida, were helpers from the first. Mrs.
Agassiz, who did not teach, held the responsi-
ble ])osition of director, and had the general
management of the school.

In the summer of 1859 Professor and Mrs.
Agassiz enjoyed a trip to Europe, passing
happy weeks with his mother and sister at
Montagny, Switzerland. In April, 1865, they
went to South America on the scientific ex-
pedition whose history is recorded in the book
entitled "A Journey in Brazil."

In December, 1871, they embarked on one
of the vessels of the United States Coast Survey,
the "Hassler," fitted out for deep-sea dredg-
ing, which sailed through the Strait of Magel-
lan and then northward along the Pacific coast
to San Francisco, entering the Golden Gate
August 24, 1872. During this voyage a journal
of scientific and personal experience was kept
by Mrs. Agassiz under her hu.^band's direction.
A part of it was published in the Atlantic
Monthly.

The eighth tlecade of the nineteenth century,
which witnesses! in July, 187.3, the opening of
the School of Natural History at Penikese, and
in December following, the funeral of " the
Master," was the decade in which a movement
was made toward securing for women in Cam-
bridge the real Harvard education or its equiv-
alent. The initiative appears to have been or
was taken by Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Gilman. A
plan for instituting for women, outside the
college, a tluplicate course of the Harvard in-
struction was received with favor in December,
1878, by President Eliot and by some of the
faculty who had been consulted. On February
22, 1879, was issued a circular headed "Private
Collegiate Instruction for Women," setting
forth the project. It was signed by Mrs. Louis
Agassiz, Mrs. E. W. Gurney, Mrs. J. P. Cooke,
Mrs. J. B. Greenough, Mrs. Arthur Gilman,
Miss Alice M. Longfellow, Mrs. Lillian Horsford,
and Arthur Gilman, secretary. Examinations
for admission to the classes were held in Sep-
tember, and work in the lecture room began
at once. Twenty-five students completed the
first year's course. On October 16, 1882, it
having become necessary to raise a fund to



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



purchase the Fay House, the aljove-named
ladies and others who had joined them legally
became a corporation, with the title, "The
Society for the Collegiate Instruction of
Women."

Ihider the popular name of "The Harvartl
Annex," invented by one of its students, the
institution grew and flourished. Twice was
the Fay House enlargeil. In 1894, by act of
the State Legislature, the name of The Society
for the Collegiate Instruction of AVonien was
changed to Radcliffe College, the bill receiving
the signature of (ioveinor Greenhalge, March
23, 1894. It authorized Radcliffe to confer
on women, with the ai)proval of the President
and Fellows of Harvard, all honors and degrees
as fully as any university or college in the
Connnonwealth.

President of Harvard Annex from the be-
ginning, Mrs. Agassiz was President of Rad-
cliffe until 1900, when she tenderetl her resig-
nation. The extent, character, and value of
her services to the college in this long period
are known only to those who have been asso-
ciated with her in its management or have at-
teniled as students. She continued as Hon-
orary President of the Associates of Radcliffe,
who constitute its Corporation, and ex-officio
member of the Academic Board and chairman
of the Council, until the close of the academic
year 1902-1903. On June 23, 1903, she pre-
sided at the Commencement exercises, and
conferred degrees on ninety-nine candidates —
eighty Bachelors of Arts, and nineteen Masters
of Arts. In the precetling week she had re-
signed the acting presidency, feeling herself
no longer equal to the res])onsil:)ilities of the
position; and Dr. Le Baron Russell IJriggs, the
second officer of Harvard University, had ac-
cepted the presidency of Radcliffe College, the
choice being one which gave Mrs. Agassiz
"much pleasure and entire satisfaction." Mrs.
Agassiz's letter of withilrawal closed with these
words : —

"I am grateful for the length of years which
has allowed me to see the fulfilment of our
cherished hope for Radcliffe in this closer re-
lation of her academic life and government
with that of Harvard. With cheerful confi-
dence in her future, which now seems assured



to me, with full and affectionate recognition
of all that her Council, her Academic Board,
antl her Associates have done to bring her where
she now stands, I bitl farewell to my colleagues.
At the same time I thank them for their un-
failing support and encouragement in the work
which we have shared together in behalf of
Radcliffe College."

Released from her former responsibilities as
ex-officio member of the Coimcil and chairman
of the Academic Board, Mrs. Agassiz remains
(1903-04) as Honorary President of the Asso-
ciates of Radcliffe.

Professor Louis Agassiz is survived by the
three children above named — Professor Alexan-
der, director of the Agassiz Museum: Mrs.
Quincy A. Shaw, antl l\Irs. Henry Lee Higgin-
son. Mrs. Agassiz continues to make her home
on Quincy Street, Cambridge. She has also a
summer cottage at Nahant, overlooking the
glacier-marked, wave-beaten cliffs of the North
Shore, a short distance from the stone cottage
built by her grandfather Perkins.

Going abroad with Miss Mary Felton, her
niece, in 1895, Mrs. Agassiz si)ent a number
of months in Italy, journeyed through Ger-
many, France, antl the Tyrol, and in England
visited Newnham and Girton Colleges for
women.

Mrs. Agassiz is the author or editor of the
following named books: "A First Lesson in
Natural History," by Acta-a, 1859, republished
in 1879 with the author's name; "Seaside
Studies in Natural History," by Elizabeth C.
and Alexander Agassiz, 1865; "Geological
Sketches," 18G6; "A Journey in Bi'azil," by
Professor antl Mrs. Louis Agassiz, 1868; "Louis
Agassiz, his Life antl Correspontlence," in two
volumes, editetl by Elizabeth Cary Agassiz,
1885.

EDNAH DOW CHENEY, one of the
founders in 1862 of the New England
Htjspital, Boston, its secretary for
twenty-seven years antl president fif-
teen years, is numbered among the veterans of
the forward movements in education, philan-
thropy, and reform of the nineteenth century,

who happily still live to grace by their presence
and help by their wise counsels the delibera-
tive assemblies and budding activities of the
twentieth century. She has recently given to
the public an interesting volume of "Reminis-
cences." Born in Boston, June 27, 1824,
daughter of Sargent Smith and Ednah Parker
(Dow) Littlehale, she was named for her mother,
and until her marriage, May 19, 1853, to the
artist, Seth AVells Cheney, was known as Ednah
Dow Littlehale.

Her father was for thirty years a Boston
merchant. His native place was Gloucester,
Mass. Born in 1787, he died in 1851. He
was of the fifth generation of the Essex Coufity
family founded by Richard Littlehale, who
took the "oath of supremacy and allegiance to
pass for New England in the Mary &amp; John of
London, Robert Sayres, Master, 24th March,
1633," joined the Massachusetts Bay Colony
at Ipswich, and, eventually settling in Haver-
hill, was Town Clerk for twenty years, serving
also as Clerk of the Writs. Richard* Littlehale,
of Gloucester (Joseph;'' Isaac,' Richard'), Mrs.
Cheney's grandfather, was a Captain of militia.
He married a widow, Mrs. Sarah Byles Edgar,
daughter of Captain Charles Byl^'-'^- w^^o
connnanded a company at the siege of Louis-
burg, and who also fought at Quebec under
Wolfe.

Mrs. Cheney's mother, Mrs. Ednah P. Little-
hale, a native of Exeter, N.H., born in 1799,
died in Boston in 1876. She was the daughter
of Jeremiah and Ednah (Parker) Dow and on
the paternal side a descendant in the seventh
generation of Thomas Dow, one of the early
.settlers of Newbury, I\Ia,ss., freeman in 1642.
The Dow ancestral line is Thomas,' Stephen,- '
Nathaniel,* Captain Jeremiah,'^ Jeremiah," Ed-
nah Parker (Mrs. Littlehale).

Thomas' Dow removed from Newbury to
Haveihill, where he died in 1654. Stephen,"
son of Thomas and his wife Phebe, was born
in Newlniry in 1642. Stephen,^ born in Haver-
hill in 1670, married Mary Hutchins. Their
son Nathaniel,* born in 1()99, married Mary
Hendricks, and lived in Haverhill and Me-
thuen, Mass., and Salem, N.IL, formerly a part
of Haverhill, Mass.

Captain Jeremiah,'^ l&gt;orn in Haverhill, Mass.,



in 1738, married Lydia Kimball, of Bradford,
daughter of Isaac* Kimball, a lineal descendant
of Richard' Kimball, of Ipswich. Captain
Jeremiah^ Dow died in Salem, N.H., in 1826.
His name is in the Revolutionary Rolls of New
Hampshire under different dates. He com-
manded a company in Lieutenant Colonel
Welch's regiment, which marched from Salem,
N.H., to join the Northern army in September,
1777. He was probably the Jeremiah Dow of
New Hampshire who was private in Captain
Marston's company in the expeflition to Crown
Point in 1762. Retire H. Parker marched to
Cambridge as a minute-man of the Second
Bradford Foot Company on the alarm of April
19, 1775.

Mrs. Littlehale's maternal grandparents were
Lieutenant Retire H. and Ednah (Hardy)
Parker, of East Bradford, now Groveland,
Mass. The Parker line of ancestry began with
Abraham' Parker, who married at Woburn
in 1644 Rose Whitlock, and about the year
1653 removed to Chelmsford. It continued
through Abraham,^ who married Martha Liver-
more and settled in East Bradford; Abrahanr'
antl wife, Elizal)eth Bradstreet (a descendant
of Humphrey Bradstreet, of Rowley) ; Abi-a-
ham* and his second wife, Hannah Beckett,
daughter of Retire Beckett, of Salem, belonging
to a noted family of ship-builders; to Lieutenant
Retire H. Parker and his wife, Ednah Hardy,
above named.

Martha Livermore, wife of Abraham^ Parker,
of East Bradford, was a daughter of John Liver-
more, of Watertown (the founder of the family
of this name in New England), and his wife
Grace (born Sherman), whom he married in
England, and who was closely related to the
immigrant progenitors of the most prominent
Sherman families of America. Mrs. Grace
Sherman Livermore was a useful member of
the colony, being an obstetrician. She sur-
vived her husl)and, and died in Chelmsford in
1690, aged seventy-five years (gravestone).

Judging from printed records, the name Ed-
nah has come down to Mrs. Cheney not only
from her mother, her grandmother Dow, and
her great-grandmother Parker, but from a more
remote ancestress, Mrs. Ednah Bailey, wife of
Richard' Bailey, o-'" Rowley, Mass. Tracing



REPRESENT ATRT: WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



backward, we find that Mrs. Ednah Hardy
Parker, born in 1745, was the daughter of Cap-
tain EHphalef and Hannah (Platts) Hardy,
grand-daughter of Jonas Platts and his wife,
Anne' Bailey, and great-grand-daughter of
Deacon Joseph^ Bailey, of East Bradford, who
was son of Richard' and his wife Ednah.
Richard Bailey was one of the company that
set up in Rowley the first cloth-mill in America.
Mrs. Ednah Bailey's maiden name is thought
to have been Halstead.

Mrs. Cheney's birthplace was on Belknap
Street, now Joy, about half-way up Beacon Hill
from Cambridge Street. She was the third
chikl born to her parents. Five children came
after her, one a little brother; but only four —
Ednah and three sisters, one a lifelong invalid —
lived to adult age. When she was two years
old, the family removed to Hayward Place, and
six years later they took up their abode in a
new house on Bowdoin Street. At the first
school she attended, kept by the Misses Pem-
berton, she had gootl training in reatling, spell-
ing, arithmetic, grammar, anil geography. The
second was Mr. William B. P^owle's Monitorial
School, which she entered with her elder sister,
Mary Frances. Here she distinguished herself
by her knowledge of grannnar, as shown by
her skill in "parsing," antl her ready recitations
in other studies that interested her, one of these
being French, which was especially well taught.
The attraction of a new and friendly acquaint-
ance, Miss Caroline Healey, drew her to the
school on Mount Vernon Street of Mr. Joseph
H. Abbot. For a few terms she continued to
advance in various ways of learning, more or
less pleasurable, in the meantime successfully
cultivating independence of thought, till, feel-
ing her-self not in harmony with the constituted
authorities, she was as anxious to leave the
Abbot school as she had been to enter it. Here
ended her school-days — education still to be
won. The home atmosphere was favorable to
mental growth. Love of learning, with a taste
for good literature, was an inheritance. The
mother, "a beautiful type of woman, of good
practical ability and great tenderness of heart,
was very fond of reading." "Indeed," says
Mrs. Cheney, " I can never remember seeing
either her or my father sitting down to rest



without a book in their hands." Mr. Littlehale
had a good knowledge of history, especially
American.

The period of time now arrived at, the vivi-
fying dawn of New England Transcendentalism,
brought golden opportunities to the young as-
pirant for intellectual culture. A great awak-
ening and a new sense of the surpassing riches
of life was the result to Ednah D. Littlehale of
attending for three successive seasons the con-
versations of Margaret Fuller. Few teachers
have shown to such a degree the power of per-
sonality.

Mrs. Cheney writes: "I absorbed her life and
her thoughts, and to this day I am astonished
to find how large a part of what I am when I
am most myself I have derived from her. . . .
She did not make us her disciples, her blind
followers. She opened the book of life and
helped us to read it for ourselves."

Of Mr. Emer-son, Mrs. Cheney says, " I never
missed an opportunity of hearing him or read-
ing his works"; and of Mr. Alcott, not all of
whose theories she couUl accept, "But he gave
me an insight into the life and thoughts of the
old philosophers, anil moreover gave me the
constant sense of the spiritual, the supersen-
sual life that is the most precious of all posses-
sions."

It is significant that Mrs. Cheney and her
elder sister, Mary F., were among the first
parishioners of Theodore Parker when he came
from West Roxbury to Boston, 1846. Inspirer,
friend, and comforter in time of sorrow he ever
remained.

For a year or two before her marriage Mrs.
Cheney was the secretary of the School of De-
sign for Women in Boston, of which she was
one of the founders. Short-lived, the school
yet served to show the existence of talent among
American women, and is remembered as "one
of the failures that enriched the ground for
success."

Twin ambitions, art and literature, were na-
tive to Mrs. Cheney. Choosing the latter for
her field of action, she ceased not to cultivate
her taste for the former. As an artist's wife
she maile her first visit to Europe, sailing with
her husband for Liverpool in August, 1854.
The year following their return (in June, 1855)

witnessed the hirth of a daughter, Margaret
Swan, in September, 1S55, and the death of Mr.
Cheney in April, 1856, in South Manchester,
Conn., his native place. He was one of the
earliest crayon artists in America. Mrs. Howe
thus speaks of him: "Seth Cheney's crayon
portraits were among the delights of his time.
The foremost women of Boston were glad to
sit to him, and his rendering of their features
has now for us

"' The tender p;rare of a day that is dead.'

Among his portraits of men, I especially re-
member one of Theodore Parker which was
highly prized. An exhibition of a number of
these works was arranged some years since by
Mr. S. R. Koehler, curator of engravings, Art
Museum, at the Boston Art Museum. It was
an occasion of much interest, recalling many
lovely and distinguished personalities, inter-
preted by Mr. Cheney with a grace and simplicity
all his own."

Mrs. Cheney was one of the subscribers
toward the establishment in 1856, under the
leadenship of Dr. Zakrzewska, of the first
women's hospital, the New York Infirmary for
Indigent Women and Children. A few years
later she was interested with others in the ad-
dition of a clinical department to the medical
school for women in Boston, now merged in
Boston University. In 1863 she was one of
the three women corporators of the New
England Hospital, which they had started
in 1862 in a house on Pleasant Street. "Ac-
cepting the position of secretary, Mrs. Cheney," to
quote the words of Dr. Zakrzewska, "devoted
herself to the work, and became one of the most
powerful advocates and supporters of this in-
stitution — an institution now firmly established
and professionally recognized, and which by
its' efficiency and conscientious work has not
only educated women as physicians and nurses,
but has opened the way for the former to a
professional equality with medical men, as the
Ma.ssachusetts Medical Society was tlie first to
adnnt women as members."

Succeeding Mi.ss Lucy Goddard as president
of the hospital in 1887, Mrs. Cheney continued
in office, discharging the duties thereof with



zeal and efficiency for fifteen years, or until her
resignation on account of failing health in Oc-
tober, 1902. She is now Honorary President.

Early interested in the work of the Freed-
man's Aid Society, and becoming the secretary
of the teachers' committee on the resignation of
Miss Stevenson, Mrs. Cheney made several
visits to the South in the years directly follow-
ing the close of the war for the Union, the first
time going with Abby M. May as a delegate to
a convention in Baltimore. Unexpectedly
called upon there to address a meeting com-
posed largely of colored people, she had her
first experience in public speaking. During
her absence on one of these Southern trips a
society was formed in Boston, of which she
was appointed a director, being now Honorary
President, and in which she has continued to
work — the Free Religious Association, "the
freedom and inspiration of whose first meet-
ings" she finds it "impossible to report."

In 1868 Mrs. Cheney was one of the founders
of the New England Women's Club, which soon
came to be recognized as a forceful influence for
good in the community; and about the same
time she identified herself with the woman suf-
frage movement. For some years she was Vice-
president of the Massachusetts School Suffrage
Association. Joining the Association for the
Advancement of W^omen early in the seven-
ties, a year or two after its organization, she
became one of its most valued workers and
speakers. Mrs. Cheney also assisted in the
founding of a horticultural school for women,
of which Abby W. May became president. It
was given up when Bussey College opened, and
admitted women to its classes.

Mrs. Cheney's second visit to Europe in 1877,
in company with her sisters and her daughter,
was saddened in Rome by the death of her
sister Helen. Returning to Boston in 1878, she
respontled to an invitation to give a course of
lectures on art at the Concoril School of Phi-
losophy the following summer, and continued
to lecture throughout the session.

In 1882 Mrs. Cheney was bereft of her daugh-
ter. She had been a student of great ])romise
at the Massachu-setts Institute of Technology;
and, after she laid down her books and her
young life, a room in the Technology building



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

was fitted up and named for her the "Margaret
Swan Cheney Reading Room."

Since 1863 Mrs. Cheney has made her home
in Jamaica Plain. Her interest in things that
make for Imman welfare and progress con-
tinues unabated. Her voice in these later
days is yet occasionally heard in pulilic, and
her pen is still that of a ready if not constant
writer.

Mrs. Howe, speaking from the standpoint of
long and intimate acquaintance, says: "Mrs.
Ednah Dow Cheney is one of the marked per-
sonalities of the last fifty years in her native
town of Boston. In ail this period of time she
has been prominent in movements of sound
and needed reform. Naturally averse to per-
sonal publicity, she has not shunned it where
her name and word could add weight to the
atlvocacy of a just cause. In the education
and health of the comnmnity she has shown
the most lively interest. She has been a strenu-
ous champion of the claims of the colored race
to political and social justice. She has hatl
much at heart the spread of religious tolera-
tion and the enfranchisement of her own sex.
One who has been proud and glad to work with
her may say that she has always found her a
woman of good counsel and of reliable judg-
ment. Motives of i)ersonal advancement are
foreign to her nature. Her life has been en-
riched by true culture, by the love of all that
is beautiful in art, -literature, and character.
The good work which she has contributed to
the tasks of her day and generation will surely
endure, and should be held, with her imme, in
loving and lasting remembrance."

ELIZABI'.TH PORTER GOULD, author
ami lecturer of -witle reputation, now
a resident of Boston, is a native of
Essex County, Massachusetts. The
eldest daughter of John Averell and Elizabeth
Cheever (Leach) Gould, she comes of substan-
tial New England stock, numbering among her
ancestors two colonial governors, the first woman
j)oet of New England, eight or more ministers of
the gospel, and several Revolutionary patriots.
She can trace her descent from over thirty early
settlers of Essex County. Through the public
services of nine of her forbears she is eligible
to membership in the Society of Colonial Dames.

The Gould ancestral line is: Zaccheus,' John,-^
Solomon,^ John,^ " John Averell' — showing Eliza-
beth P. to be of the eighth generation in New
England. Zaccheus Gould came to the Bay
Colony about the year 1638, and somewhat later
settleil in Topsfield.

The line of descent from Governor Thomas
Dudley and his wife, Dorothy Yorke, is through
his daughter Anne, wife of Governor Simon
Bradstreet; their son, John Bradstreet, born in
Andover, Mass., in 1652, who married Sarah
Perkins and lived in Topsfield; his son, Simon
Bradstreet, who married Elizabeth, ilaughter
of the Rev. Joseph Capen, of Topsfield; Eliza-
beth Bradstreet, who married Joseph Peaboily;
Priscilla Peabody, married Isaac Averell; Elijah
Averell, married Mary Gould ; and their daughter,
Mary Averell, who, marrying John" Gould,
named above, became the mother of John
Averell Gould and grandmother of Elizabeth
Porter Gould.

Mary Goukl, wife of Elijah Averell and ma-
ternal grandmother of John Averell Gould, was
a daughter of Captain Joseph Gould, of Tops-
field, and his wife l']lizal)eth, daughter of the
Rev. John Emerson, of Maiden. Her maternal
grandfather, the Rev. John Iilmerson, was a
son of Edward and Rebecca (Waldo) Emerson,
grandson of the Rev. Joseph and Elizabeth
(Bulkeley) ]&lt;]mer.son, Elizabeth Bulkeley being
the daughter of the Rev. Edwartl Bulkeley and
grand-daughter of the Rev. Peter Bulkeley,
the first minister of Concord, Mass. (Edward
Emerson and his wife, Rebecca Waldo, were
great-grandparents of Ralph Waldo Emerson.)

Miss Gould's mother was a daughter of Ben-

jaiiiin,' Jr., and Susan (Cheever) Leach, of Man-
chester, Mass., and on the paternal side a de-
scendant of Robert^ Leach, an early settler of
that town, and his father, Lawrence Leach, who
is said to have come to Boston from Scotland
in 162S. Susan Cheever Leach, Miss Gould's
maternal grandmother, was a grand-daughter
of the Rev. Ames^ Cheever, of Manchester, and
his wife, Sarah Choate, and great-grand-flaugh-
ter of the Rev. Sanuicf- Cheever, of Marble-
head, who was son of Ezekiel' Cheever, the fa-
mous schoolmaster of the olden time in Massa-
chusetts and Connecticut, for forty years the
head of the Boston Latin School.

In Chelsea, whither Mr. and Mrs. John A.
Gould removed when their children were young,
they resided for about thirty years, the city
then being noted for its gootl society, number-
ing among its leading families the Osgoods,
Frosts, Fays, Sawyers, Shillabers, and others.
Mr. Gould for a number of years served as one
of the School Committee, also as a member of
the Common Council, and was chairman of
the Music Committee of the First Congrega-
tional Church. Mrs. Gould was one of the fore-
most in works of benevolence, and was nmch
loved and respected. She died in Chelsea in
1893. A daughter Susie, who had unusual
musical talent, was the "little rosebud of a
Chelsea girl" who sang at one of the public
readings of Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1872,
being thus mentioned in Mrs. Fields' biography
of Mrs. Stowe.

Elizabeth Porter Gould, the eldest daughter,
was named for her grantimother Gould's sister
Elizabeth, the wife of Dr. John Porter, of
"Fairfields," the old Porter estate in Wenham.
With Miss Gould the possession of talent has
been a call for its improvement. The pleas-
ant paths of learning in which her mental powers
were developed easily led into equally pleasant
fields of useful activity. Whenever congrat-
ulated upon the many patriotic services she
has rendered, she has always declared with her
kinsman. Dr. Benjamin Apthorp Gould, that
her "ancestry made it a necessity." And so
in regard to her many acts of kindness, her in-
telligent sympathy in behalf of so many causes,
she simply says: "I was born in a house dedi-
cated to God and humanity. I can't go back



on that." Questioned, she tells how the house
in Manchester-by-the-Sea, where she first saw
the light of this world, .June 8, 1848, was dedi-
cated like a church by a kinsman of her mother's,
who, on its completion, called together people
frojn far and near for a service of prayer and
praise.

An inspiring leader and adviser of clubs tlur-
ing her long residence in Chelsea, after the club
era began, she was also for years an intelligent
power among the society women of Boston,
Brookline, Newton, and other places, by her
"Topic Talks," opportunities for which came
to her wholly urtsolicited. In fact, they seemed
to be thrust u])on her, for it was clearly noted
that this author of varied learning and reserve
force had the power of expressing herself in
extemporaneous speech, as well as on paper,
a rather rare gift.

•As an officer in philanthroiMc and educational
organizations, she has struck important chords
in the line of reform. Her brochure, " How
I became a Woman SufTragist," preluded a
membership in the Massachusetts Woman Suf-
frage Association, and led to the casting of her
annual ballot at school board elections. As
a director from the first of the Massachusetts
Society for Good Citizenship, she entered by
voice and pen into the good government work
of that organization. As an officer for years
of the Massachusetts Society for the University
Education of Women, her good judgment and
wise counsel have been of service. As a mem-
ber of the Woman's Board of Foreign Missions,
she is able, as she says, to become a seed-sower
in behalf of the broader education of foreign
women. She has written convincingly in the
interests of the American college on the Bos-
phorus and in other lands. Her article in the
Century for 1889 on " Pundita Ramabai" was
but an outline of the lecture which, with those
on "John and Abigail Adams," "John and
Dorothy Hancock," "Holland and the United
States," "The Brownings and America," and
others, she has delivered before numerous
women's clubs and other organizations. Her
gratuitous platform work in behalf of the George
Washington Memorial Association led her as
far south as Richmond. Her lecture in Char-
lottesville was the first ever delivered at



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



13



the University of Mrgiiiia by a woman. As
seen in her poems and speeches in behalf of the
restoration of "Old Ironsides," her plea for
the Lincoln memorial collection at Washing-
ton, D.C., and in the brochure, "An Offering
in behalf of the Deaf," concerning speech edu-
cation, many another cause has had her helping
hand.

Miss Gould is an honorary member of the
Castilian Club of Boston, having contributed
one of the ablest papers to volume xxvii. of
members' essays, presented by the club to the
Boston Public Library. Her right-to-the-
point speeches on a variety of subjects also
made her an honorary member of the Wednes-
day Morning Club of Boston. She was the
only woman speaker upon the erection of the
Abigail Adams cairn, June 17, 1896, under the
auspices of the Atlams Chapter, Mrs. Nelson
V. Titus, Regent, and was the poet of the Web-
ster Centennial at Fryeburg, Me., in the sum-
mer of 1902, having been made some time be-
- fore, for articles written on Webster, an hon-
orary member of the Boston Webster Histori-
cal Society.

Her conscientious antl extensive research
in historical realms is seen in her interesting
book, "John Adams and Daniel Webster as
Schoolmasters," for which the Hon. Charles
Francis Adams wrote an introduction. This,
with its companion, "Ezekiel Cheever: School-
master," will, it is said, become the final word
on the respective subjects, to be more and
more valued as the years go by. Her versa-
tility has led to her being the poet of occasions
and of movements. Her "Endeavor Rally
Hymn," to which her nephew, Willard Gould
Harding, composed the music, has been widely
scattered. Her "Columbia — America," set to
music by Adeline Frances Fitz, which is
played by Sousa's Band, is the accepted song
of the Massachusetts Daughters of the Revo-
lution. Two of her Children's Songs, set to
music and published by Clement Ryder, are
in demand for Children's Sunday. Her verses
on the Mountain Laurel, on its proposal as
the State flower, were dedicated to the Massa-
chusetts Floral Emblem Society. Perhaps Miss
Gould is most potnilarly known by her single
stanza, "Don't AVorry," which has been copied



far and near, even a little Alaska paper having
caught its sunshine, and, widely scattered in
leaflet form, has been a comfort to many a
troubled soul. Not to mention, for lack of space,
the "Songs of the Months" and verses to nota-
ble contemporaries and friends, it may here
be stated that all that Miss Gould wishes
saved of her poetry has been recently collected
under the name " One's Self I sing, and Other
Poems." A story, "A Pioneer Doctor," a*nd
"The Brownings in America," have been
recently published.

A book of selections, her "Gems from Walt
Whitman," published in 1889, called forth
warm response from "the good gray poet": "I
want to thank you as a woman," he said, "for
the capacity of understanding me; for," he
added, somewhat meditatively, "only the com-
bination of the pure heart and the broad mind
makes this possible." The publication of her
"Anne Gijchrist and Walt Whitman" in 1900
gave further evidence of her generous capacity
for friendship and her appreciation of that gra-
cious quality in others. An official connection
with the Walt Whitman International Asso-
ciation was accorded to Miss Gould in recog-
nition of her labors of love in that direction.

Educated in music, "brought up," as she
once said, "on symphony concerts," a sym-
pathetic student also in other realms of art,
she has been both a musical and an art critic.
Her tastes are nowhere more plainly seen than
in the collection of choice paintings, and literary
treasures — signed photographs, autograph books,
letters, stamps, and souvenir cards — which her
wide acquaintance with famous men and
women in this country and abroad has
brought to her.

An extensive traveller in this' country and
in Europe, Miss Gould, like some other tourists,
has made a practice of dipping her hands in
the water of various places she has visited,
her list including the Atlantic antl Pacific
Oceans, and the chief rivers, lakes, bays, falls,
of our own land and a number of the most fa-
mous abroad. The hot geysers of the Na-
tional Park and the icy waters of the Muir
Glacier in Alaska mark the extremes of tem-
perature she has encountered in pursuing this
"hobby." The highest water she has reached

is that of the Yellowstone Lake, and the
lowest, that of Holland.

In concluding this brief notice of Miss Gould
and her work, it may be said she lives in the
atmosphere of her own lines: —

'' One (lay at a tinic
For ]iuiiiaiiitv's ulimh —
One day at a time."



LOUISE CHANDLER MOULTON. The
picture of Louise Chandler Moulton
__J as she was described to me by one
who saw her on her wedding-day,
standing on the church porch, in the magic
moment that is neither sunset nor twilight,
like Helen's, her beauty shadowed in white
veils, a britle blooming, blushing, full of life and
love and joy, has alwaj's been a radiant vision
to my mind's eye.

Hardly more than a child though she was —
her school-days just six weeks over — she had
then printed one book, and had written another,
"Juno Clifford," a novel, issued anonymously
a few months after her marriage to William
Upham Moulton, the publisher of a weekly
paper to which she had been a contributor.

From the beginning she was a child of genius:
it was only through the intuitive force of genius
that she was able to know the hearts of men
and women as she did at that very early period
of her life — a genius that has ever since grown
steadily as day grows out of dawn, and that
reached its culmination in lyrics and in sonnets
that have few superiors in our language.

[The daughter of Lucius L. and Louisa R.
(Clark) Chandler, she was born in Pomfret,
Conn. Her father was son of Charles and
Hannah (Cleveland) Chandlei', and was de-
scended from William' Chandler, an early set-
tler of Roxbury, Mass., through his son John,
who was about two years of age when the fam-
ily came from England. John^ Chandler in
1686 removed from Roxbury, Mass., to Wood-
stock, Conn. He was one of the twelve Rox-
bury men who bought the territory known as
Mashamoquet (now Pomfret), he being one
of the six grantees in May, 16(S6. His wife,
Elizabeth Douglas, was the daughter of \^'\\\-



iam Douglas, who was horn in 1610, "without
doubt in Scotland," came to New England in
1640, and in 1660 settled in New London,
Conn., where he was a deacon of the church.

Mrs. Hannah Cleveland Chandler was born
at Pomfret in 1783, daughter of Solomon' and
Hannah (Sharpe) Cleveland. Her father was
a soldier in the war of the Revolution. Her
mother (great-grandmother of Mrs. Moulton),
described as "a woman of rare intelligence and
wonderful gift of language," was a notable
student of Greek literature. Solomon' Cleve-
land was a descendant in the fifth generation
of Moses Cleveland, of Woburn, Mass., the
immigrant i:)rogenitor of the New England
family of this surname, the line being Mo.ses,'
Edward,^'' Silas,^ Solomon.'* EdwanP Cleve-
land's wife was Rebecca Paine, daughter of
Elisha and Rebecca (Doane) Paine and grand-
daughter of Thomas and Mary^ (Snow) Paine.
Mary Snow was a daughter of Nicholas' Snow,
who came over in the "Ann" in 1623, and his
wife Constance, who came with her father,
Ste]:)hen' Hopkins, in the "Mayflower" in
1620. See Snow, Paine, Doane, Cleveland,
Chandler, and Douglas Genealogies.]

The childhood of Mrs. Moulton was one that
fostered her imaginative power. Her parents
still clung to the strictest Calvinistic princii)les.
Games, dances, romances, were things forbid-
den; and, as playmates were few, the child
lived in a worUl of fancy. "I was lonely,"
she has said, "and I sought companions. What
was there to do but to create them?"

Indeed, before her eighth year her active
mind was creating a world of its own in a little
unwritten play, which it pleased her fancy to
call a Spanish drama, and with which she be-
guiled all the summer, filling it with person-
ages as real and as tlear to her as those she met
every day. Dwelling in such surroundings,
her existence and her powers were as anoma-
lous as if a nightingale or a tropic bird of para-
dise were found in the nest of our home-keep-
ing birds. Yet in her lovely mother's heart
there nmst have been the elelicate music of the
song-sparrow's strain; and never could she have
carried her power so triumphantly l)Ut for the
strength she inherited from her father.

The rigid Calvinism of the family had un-

doubtedly a very stinuilating effect on tlie
emotions of the sensitive child, and to its far-
reaching influence may be ascribed the tinge
of melancholy found in many of her pages.
Not that they are not often illuminated with
all the joy of being, but that, whenever the
sun is bright, she has seen and felt the shadow.
"One would not ignore," she says, "the glad-
ness of the dawn, the strong splendor of the
midday sun; but, all the .same, the shadows
lengthen, and the day wears late. And yet
the dawn comes again after the night; and
one has faith — or is it hope rather than faith? —
that the new world, which swims into the ken
of the spirit to whom death gives wings, may
be fairer even than the dear familiar earth,
. . . this mocking sphere, where we have never
been quite at home, because, after all, we are
but travellers, and this is our hostelry, and not
our permanent abode."

The child Louise had a great vitality, and,
when free from the liurdens ami terrors of
"election" and "damnation," she exulted in
the breath she drew. Running in the face of
a great wind was one of her joys, feeling how
alive she was; and she realizeil the reverse of
such emotion in listening to the sountl of the
wind through an outer keyhole, which seemed
to her the calling of trumpets, the crying of
lost souls. She lived all this time so nuieh in
a world of her own that when, in her fifteenth
year, she first sent some verses to a ncwspai)er
she felt it a guilty secret.

Her home in Boston, after her marriage, was
a delightful one. Her house was soon a centre
of attraction; and, surrounded by friends, she
exercised there a gracious hosjjitality, and met
the brilliant men and women who made the
Boston of that epoch famous. Here was born
her daughter, the golden-hairetl Florence, who
is now the wife of Mr. William Schaefer, of
South Carolina. Here her husband died,
and here she has remained through the days
of her widowhood till the house has become
historic.

She continued her literary work through all
these years. Besides writing her stories and
essays and poems, she sent to the New York
Tribune a series of interesting anil brilliant
letters concerning the literary life of Boston,



giving advance reviews of new tjooks and tell-
ing of the affairs of the Radical Club, of which
Mr. Emerson, Colonel Higginson, Jolin Weiss,
Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, and others of eminence
were members. In all the six years , during
which these letters appeared she never made
in them any unkind statement, or wrote a sen-
tence that could cause pain. Through all her
critical work, indeed, she has exercisetl a tender
regard for the feelings of others, as well as
great generosity of praise, preferring rather
to be silent than to utter an unkindness.

Contributing poems and stories of power
and grace to the leading magazines. Harper's,
the Atlantic, the Galaxy, the first Scribner's,
she also published a half-dozen very success-
ful books for children, "Bedtime Stories,"
"Firelight Stories," "Stories Told at Twi-
light," and others that have always held the
popular taste; and she collectetl a few of her
many atlult tales into volumes, "Miss Eyre of
Boston" and "Some Women's Hearts."

Her first voyage across the sea was made
in the January of 1876. Pausing in London
long enough to see the Queen open Parliament
in person for the first time after the Prince
Consort's death, she hastened through Paris
on her way to Rome and to raptures of old
palaces and gardens and galleries, touched to
tears b)' the Pope's benediction, abandoned
to the gayety of the Carnival, enjoying the
hospitality of the studios of \'edder, Story,
Rollin Tilton, anil others, and of the gracious
and charming social life of Rome. Her de-
scriptions of all this, overflowing with the
sensitiveness to beauty which is a part of her
nature, make her "Random Rambles" most
enchanting reading. After Rome she visited
Florence, and then Venice, feeling to the quick
its mysterious anil elusive spell, and then
again Paris, and again London and the Lon-
don season.

Entertained by Lord Houghton, she met
Browning and Swinburne, George Eliot, King-
lake, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and a host of
others, seeing especially a great deal of Brown-
hig — her personal beauty and charm, her
exquisite manners and modest self-possession,
her unerring tact, her voice, of which an Eng-
lish poet said, "Her voice, wherein all sweet-



16



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



nesses abide," having as much to do with all
this as her hterary excellence.

It was the next winter that the Macmillans
brought out her first volume of poems, "Swal-
low Flights"; and, althovigh she had trembled
to think of its fate at the hands of alien critics,
she betrayed no elation at the chorus of praise
with which it was received. The Examiner
spoke of the power and originality of the verses,
of the music and the intensity as surpassing
any verse of George Eliot's, declaring that the
sonnet entitled "One Dread" might have been
written by Sir Philip Sidney.

" No depth, dear Love, for thee i.s too iirofound,
There is no farthest height thou mayst not dare,
Nor shall thy wings fail in tlie upper air :
In funeral robe and wreath my past lies bound :
No old-time voice assails me with its sound
When thine I hear — no former joy seems fair,
Since now one only thing could bring despair.
One grief, like compassing seas, my life surround,
One only terror in my way be met.
One great eclipse change my glad day to night,
One phantom only turn from red to wliite
The lips whereon thy lips have once been set:
Thou knowest well, dear Love, what that must be —
The dread of some dark day unshared by thee."

The Athenceum also dwelt on the vivid and
subtle imagination and delicate loveliness of
these verses and their perfection of technique.
The Academy spoke warndy of their felicity of
epithet, their healthiness, their suggestiveness,
their imaginative force pervaded by the depth
and sweetness of perfect womanhood; and the
Tattler pronounced her a mistress of form and
of artistic j)erfection, saying also that England
had no ppet in such full sympathy with woods
and winds and waves, finding in her the one
truly natural singer in an age of s'sthetic imi-
tation. " She gives the effect of the sudden
note of the thrush," it said. "She is as spon-
taneous as Walter von Vogelweide." The
Timea, the Mornhuj Po.^t, the Literary World,
all welcomed the book with eciually warm praise,
and the Pall Mall Gazette spoke of her lyrical
feeling as like that which gave a unique charm
to Heine's songs. Very few of these critics
had she ever met, and their cordial recognition
was as surprising to her as it was delightful.
Among the innumerable letters which she .re-
ceived, filled with admiring warmth, were some



from Matthew Arnold, Austin Dobson, Freder-
ick Locker, William Bell Scott, and, in fine,
most of the world of letters of the London of
that day. Her songs were set to music by
Francesco Berger and Lady Charlcsmont, as
the^ have been later on by Margaret Lang,
Arthur Foote, Ethelbcrt Nevin, and many
others. Philip Bourke Marston wrote her,
"Much as we all love and admire your work,
it seems to me we have not yet fully realized
the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as
fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for son-
nets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever.
The first verse is eminently characteristic of
you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what
runs through nearly all of your poems, the
most exquisite and subtle blending of strong
emotion with the sense of external nature. It
seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by
the melancholy yet tender music of winds
sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through
okl trees that watch beside silent graves. Then
nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the
closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come': —

" ' Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I ?
I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'

" There can be no doubt that, measuring by
quality, not quantity, your place is in the
very foremost rank of poets. The divine sim-
plicity, strength and subtlety, the intense, fra-
grant, genuine individuality of your poems will
make them imperishable. And as they are of
no school they will be fresh, as the old delights
of earth are ever fresh." And again the same
poet wrote her concerning "The House of
Death" that it was one of the most beautiful,
the most powerful poems he knew. " No poem
gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of
Nature. The poem is Death within and Sum-
mer without — light girdling darkness — and it
leaves a picture and impression on the mind
never to be effaced."

" Not a hand has lifted the latchet
Since siie went out of the door —
No footstep shall cross the threshold
Since she can come in no more.

" There is rust upon locks and hinges,
And mould and blight on the walls.



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

And silence faints in the chambers,
And darkness waits in the halls —

" Waits as all things have waited

Since she went that day of spring,
Borne in her pallid splendor

To dwell in the Court of the King :

" With lilies on brow and bosom,
With robes of silken slieen.
And her wonderful frozen beauty
The lilies and silk between.

" Ked roses she left behind her,
But they died long, long ago :
'Twas tlie odorous ghost of a blossom
That seemed through the dusk to glow.

" The garments she left mocked the shadows
With hints of womauly grace,
And her image swims in the mirror
That was so used to her face.

" The birds make insolent nmsic

Where the sunshine riots outside.
And the winds are merry and wanton
With the sunnner's pomp and pride.

" But into this desolate mansion,
Where Love has closed the door,
Nor sunshine nor sunnner shall enter,
Since she can come in no more."

The reader must agree with the critic that
this poem of "The House of Death" is un-
equalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness.

It was apropos of this volume that in one of
his letters to her Robert Browning said he had
closed the book with music in his ears and
flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts
across his brain. And it was concerning a
later poem, "Laus \'eneris," inspired by a paint-
ing of his own, that Burne-Jones said it made
him work all the more confidently and was a
real refreshment.

" Pallid with too much longing,
White with passion and prayer,
Goddess of love and beauty.
She sits in the picture there —

" Sits with her dark eyes seeking
Something more subtle still
Than the old delights of loving
Her measureless days to fill.

" She has loved and been loved so -often
In her long immortal years
That she tires of the worn-out rapture,
Sickens of hopes and fears.



" No joys or sorrows move her,
Done with her ancient pride;
For her head she found too heavy
The crown she has cast aside.

" Clothed in her scarlet splendor.
Bright with her glory of hair,
Sad that she is not mortal —
Eternally sad and fair —

" Longing for joys she knows not,
Athirst with a vain desire,
There she sits in the picture.
Daughter of foam and fire! "

Could anything be in stronger or more glori-
ous contrast to the "House of Death" or to
"Arcady" or to that great sonnet, "At War,"
or show more varied power?

Few people coukl have met such praise and
appreciation as Mrs. Moulton received, so
calmly, so sedately and gently, without one
flutter of gratified vanity. Indecil, she is
to-day the most modest and most humble-
minded of women.

With the exception of the two years immedi-
ately following Mr. Moulton's death, when she
remained at liome and in seclusion, Mrs. Moul-
ton has every summer sailed away for the
foreign shores where she is so welcomed and
so loved. Although possibly few Americans
have had such a social as well as literary suc-
cess abroad, the hospitality she has received
has never been violated by her in pen or word:
she has printed no letters and uttered no gos-
sip concerning the houses in which she has
been a guest. She has been, through all antl
everything, a woman of unerring sense of right
and courtesy, of whom all other Americans
may be proud. Every winter sees her back
in Boston, where her house is a centre of liter-
ary life, and where one is sure to find every
stranger of distinction. For her acquaintance
among English people of prominence is as ex-
tensive as among those of our own country.

another of both the living and the dead.

It is in Boston that she has done the greater
part of her work, collated and collected a few
of her many stories and of her essaj's into vol-
umes, written her books of travel, "Random
Rambles" and "Lazy Tours," books full of
interest, published her four volumes of poetry,
and edited and prefaced with biographies "A
Last Harvest" and "Garden Secrets," and the
"Collected Poems" of Philip Bourke Marston,
and also a selection from Arthur O'Shaugh-
nessy's verses, generous with her time, her
effort, her money, and her praise.

Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote Mrs.
Moulton that he was touched with the pas-
sionate sincerity of her poems. " I cannot see,"
he added, " that the life of anient youth is
dying out of you, or Hke to." Sincerity, in-
deed, is the keynote both of her nature and her
work. She is not methodical in her processes,
never finding herself able to work through
mere intellectual endeavor, unless some strong
emotion stirs her to the tleeps. Thomas Hardy
speaks of the poems in " The Garden of Dreams "
as being penetrated "by the supreme quality,
emotion." "It is not art but nature that
gave her," said William Minto, "the spon-
taneity and directness which are so marked
characteristics of most of her poems, or that
epigrammatic concision which enables her
often to express in a sentence a whole problem
or experience."

One of Mrs. Moulton's most appreciative,
scholastic, and discriminating critics was Pro-
fcs.sor Meiklejohn, who for twenty-seven years
occupied a chair in the University of St. An-
drews, Scotland, and who was the author of



a translation of Kant, of "The Art of Writing
English," and other books of importance.
He has said with authority that she deserved
to be classed with the best Elizabethan lyrists
in her lyrics, — with Herrick and Campion and
Shakespeare, — while in her sonnets she might
rightly take a place with Milton and Words-
worth and Rossetti. "I cannot tell you how
keen and great enjoyment (sometimes even
rapture)," he wrote her, "I have got out of
your exquisite lyrics." In a series of "Notes,"
following the poems, line by line, he asserted
that the poet won her success liy the simplest
means and plainest words, as true genius always
does, and that her pages were full of emotional
and imaginative meaning. Nature and Poetry
uniting in an indissoluble whole; and Shelley
himself, he said, would have been proud to
own certain of the lines. The poem "Quest"
he found so beautiful that, in his own words,
it was "difficult to speak of it in perfectly
measured and unexaggerated language." Of
the poem "Wife to Husband" he said that
" the tenderness, the sweet ami compelling
rhythm, are worthy of the best Elizabethan
days." The sonnet, "A Summer's Growth,"
"unites," he says, the "passion of such Italian
poets as Dante with the imagination of modern
English." This was in relation to her first
voUune, "Swallow Flights"; and in conclusion
he said: "This poet must look for her brothers
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
among the noble and intense lyrists. Her in-
sight, her subtlety, her delicacy, her music,
are hardly matched, and certainly not sur-
passed by Herrick or Campion or Crashaw or
Carew or Herbert or Vaughan."

Of poems in the next volume, "The Garden
of Dreams," Professor Meiklejohn affirmed that
the perfect little gem, "Roses," was worthy of
Goethe, and that "As I Sail" had the firnmess
and imaginativeness of Heine, the perfect sim-
plicity containing magic. "Wordsworth never
wrote a stronger line," he said of one in "Voices
on the Wind."

In "At the Wind's Will" again the same
critic recognized the strong style of the six-
teenth century, noble and daring rhythms, the
"(luintessence of passion," successes gained by
the "courage of simplicity," rare specimens of

compression as well as of sweetness. "The
Gentle Ghost of Joy" he thought "a wonderful
voluntary in the best style of Chopin." In a
line of one of the sonnets, "Yet done with
striving and foreclosed of care," he finds some-
thing as good as anything of Drayton's. He
pronounced the two sonnets called "Great
Love" worthy of a "place among Dante's and
Petrarch's sonnets," antl of the sonnet, "Were
but my Spirit loosed upon the Air," he wrote,
"It is one of the greatest and finest sonnets
in the English language."

I think every one who knows and loves
poetry in its highest form and expression will
agree with all this, and will feel that the critic
spoke of very great verse. Many other critics
have been to the full as appreciative, and have
felt, as I do, the constant delight of splenditl
phrase and Shakespearian vigor ami utterance
in Louise Chandler Moulton's sonnets, anil the
atmosphere of warmth and beauty that bathes
the thought and fancy of each page.

But in spite of the largeness and high quality
of her work it is quite as much the woman as
the poet who is to be loved and admired.
Large-hearted and large-souled, of a religious
spirit unfettered by dogma, most tender, most
true, most compassionate, genial, ingenuous,
of an absolute integrity antl an absolute un-
worldliness, she has the warm affection of all
who are fortunate enough to know her at all
clo,sely. Men and women, young and old, come
to her for the pleasure of the passing hour, for
advice, for sympathy in joy or trouble. From
all over the country people write to her, con-
fiding their perplexities and sorrows, craving
intellectual or spiritual comfort, and always
receiving it. Her wortls of cheer are given
from the heart, and she has the satisfaction of
knowing the support and strength some of her
written words have been to those like the
young girl who, confined to her bed for three
years and too weak to listen to prayers, could
be helped by murmuring to herself: —

" We lay us down to sleep.
And leave to God the rest,
Whether to wake and weep
Or wake no more be best."'

Mrs. Moulton's home in Boston is full of in-



teresting souvenirs, autographs, signed pictures,
and sculptures given Ijy the artists. At every
turn there is association with famous or cher-
ished names, and here her guests find their
welcome generous and delightful, her manner
gracious, her directness reassuring, her conver-
sation full of sparkle, and her presence full of
charm. In her youth of a remarkable beauty,
a wild-rose bloom, biack-lashed and black-
browed hazel eyes, bright hair, fine features,
and the oval lines of the antique in the outline
of cheek and chin, much of that charm of her
youth she still retains, the same soft yet fear-
less glance, the same heart-warming smile, the
same grace of manner, always the same grace
of nature, the same confident assurance of the
goodness of every one in the world, loving God
in humanity, and spending herself for others.

MRS. LILLIAN M. N. STEVENS.—
" As sweet and wholesome as her
own ])iny wood" was Frances E.
WiUard's epigrammatic description
of the woman — above named — who succeeds her
as leader of the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union hosts. Mi,ss ^^'il!ard and Mrs. Stevens
first met in 1875 at Old Orchard, Me., and the
friendship there begun ripenetl into the deepest
alTection as the years passed.

Mrs. Stevens was born in Maine, and her
home has always been within the borders of
that State. Her parents were Nathaniel and
Nancy Fowler (Parsons) Ames. Her first pub-
lic work was in the school-room as teacher,
when she was Miss Ames. At the age of twenty-
one she married Mr. M. Stevens, of Stroud-
water, a charming suburb of Portland. Her
husband is in full accord with her, and is one
of the most genial of hosts to the multitude of
her co-workers who are entertained in their
hospitable home. Their only child, Mrs. Ger-
trude Stevens Leavitt, is an ardent white rib-
boner and one of the State super intenilents in
the Maine W. C. T. U.

Mrs. Stevens possesses keen business ability
and indomitable will power. She is a woman
of culture, gentle in manner, and the embodi-
ment of kindness.

The old home, which has been for a centur}'
in the Stevens fainily, resounds constantly to
the music of children's voices, for, although
Mrs. Stevens has been prominently connected
with the child-saving institution of her State,
she believes most ardently that an institution
can never be a substitute for a home; and, while
she urges her Maine women to open their doors
to Gotl's homeless little ones, she herself sets
them a practical example.

Mrs. Stevens has been one of the prime
movers in woman's temperance work ever
since the historic crusade of 1873 in Hillsboro,
Ohio. In 1874 she assisted in the organization
of the W. C. T. U. in her native State. For
three years she acted as treasurer, and she has
since been continuously its president, unani-
mously chosen. For thirteen years she was
assistant recording secretary of the National
W. C. T. U., for one year its secretary, and
at the Cleveland convention in 1894 she was,
on nomination of Miss Willard, elected vice-
president-at-large of the National Union, suc-
ceeding to the presidency in 1898.

Besides filling these offices and leading the
women of Maine as president of the constantly
growing State W. C. T. U., working and speak-
ing for it untiringly, Mrs. Stevens has carried
on a great amount of work connected with
the charities of Maine, having been officially
connected with several homes for the depend-
ent classes. For years she has been the Maine
representative in the National Conference of
Charities and Correction. She was one of the
lady managers of the World's Columbian Ex-
position.

No woman in the organization which she
leads is more loyal to its fundamental princi-
ples. None possesses in a greater degree the
confidence of its friends and the good will of
its opponents than Mrs. Stevens, of Maine.
Only those who best know her realize the depth
of her religious nature. Her creed is truly the
creed of love, her life one of peace and good
will. Her Bible always lies close at hand vipon
her desk, and .shows much reading. From the
well-worn New Testament lying upon her
couch we copied the.se words: "Tell our white
ribboners to study the New Testament. I love
the New Testament. No human being lias



ever conceived as he should what the New-
Testament means by 'loyalty to Christ.'
Among the last words spoken bv Miss Willard,
February 13, 1898." " Loyalty to Christ " may
well be calleil the keynote to Lillian Stevens's
life, and more clearly than do most people
she finds Christ always among "his brethren"
in poor, sin-stained, sorely burdened humanity.

Mrs. Stevens has said that any written ac-
count of her would have little meaning could
there not be combineil with it a sketch of the
organization which has meant so much to her
in her life work. In fact, it was with this un-
derstaniling that Mrs. Stevens consented to
have a sketch of her' life prepared for this vol-
ume.

Perhaps no question is asked more frequently
than " What has the Woman's Christian Tem-
perance Union done?" and few questions are
more difficult to answer with any degree of
satisfaction. This is not for lack of material,
but rather becau.se of an over-abundance
thereof. A few of the more general facts
of its history may here be presented.

The National AVoman's Christian Temperance
LTnion is the crystallized effort of the Women's
Crusatle of 1873-74. It was organized in
Cleveland, Ohio, November 18-20, 1874.
Its characteristics are simplicity aiul unity,
with emphasis upon individual responsibility.
It is organized by State, district, county, and
local unions. Every State and Territory in
the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii,
has a State or Territorial union, and there is a
beginning in the Philippine Islands. Ten thou-
sand towns and cities have local unions.

Twenty-five national organizers, fourteen na-
tional lecturers, and twenty-one national evan-
gelists are constantly in the field, besides those
of the several States and Territories. One thou-
sand new unions were organized in 1900. One-
fifth of all the States gained more than five
hundred members over and above all losses
in the year 1900.

Organization among the young women has
grown into a branch, with its own general sec-
retary and field workers. It is an integral
part of the W. T. C. U., and is known as the
Young Woman's ('hristian Temperance Union,
or the Y. ^\^ C. T. U.



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Organization of the children into Loyal Tem-
perance Legions is also a branch, and numbers
two hundred and fifty thousand Seniors and
Juniors. Organization among colored people
has secured nine separate State unions and
many members. Organization among the Ind-
ians is well begun in the Indian schools and
among the more civilized adult Indian women.
The department of organization among foreign-
speaking people circulates literature in eighteen
different languages, and keeps a missionary at
the port of New York. It is not unusual for
a national organizer to travel ten thousand
miles m one year. This work is largely mis-
sionary. In 1883 Miss Willard and Miss Gor-
don visited every State and Territory in the
l^nion, anil completetl an itinerary which in-
cluded every city of ten thousand or more
inhabitants by the census of 1870. Eight
round-the-world missionaries have been sent
by the National W. C. T. U.

Through Miss Willard the National was in-
strumental in organizing the World's W. C.
T. L"., which now includes fifty-eight different
countries and five hundred thousand members.

The W. C. T. U. originated the idea of scien-
tific temperance instruction in the public schools,
and has secured mandatory laws in every State
in the Union and ;i federal law governing the
District of Columbia, the Territoi'ies, and all
Indian and military schools supported by the
government. Under these laws twenty mill-
ion in the public schools receive instruction
as to the nature and effects of alcohol and to-
bacco and other narcotics on the human sys-
tem. Sixteen million children receive tem-
perance teaching in the Sunday-schools, and
two hundred and ninety-six thousand nine
hundred and sixty-four of these are pledged
total abstainers. The W. C. T. U. was an im-
portant factor in securing the insertion of the
quarterly temperance lesson in the Interna-
tional Sunday-school Lesson Series, 1884, and
in securing a world's universal temperance Sun-
day. Two hundred and fifty thousand children
are taught scientific reasons for temperance in
the Loyal Temperance Legions, and all these
children are pledged to total abstinence and
trained as temperance workers. The educa-
tional value of the W. C. T. U. to its own mem-



bers through courses of study and practical
work is immense. Before any other temper-
ance society had taken up mothers' meetings,
the W. C. T. U. had organized in thirty-seven
States and Territories, and two thousand meet-
ings were held in Illinois in one year. W. C.
T. U. schools of methods are held in all Chau-
taucjua gatherings. Indiana held a W. C. T. U.
school (jf methods in every one of its counties
in 1900.

The W. C. T. U. has largely influenced the
change in public sentiment in regard to social
drinking, equal suffrage, equal purity for both
sexes, equal remuneration for work equally
well done, equal educational, professional, and
industrial opportunities for men and women.
Through its efforts thousands of girls have been
rescued from lives of shame, and tens of thou-
sands of men have signed the total abstinence
pledge and been redeemed from inebriety.

The several States tlistributed nine million
four hunilred and forty-four thousand three
hundred and fifty pages. The National W. C.
T. U. printed and distributed in 1901 fifty-five
thousand annual leaflets of sixty-six pages
each, which, with its annual reports and other
literature given away, amounts to over five
million pages.

The Union Siynol, the official organ for the
National and World's W. C. T. U., a sixteen-
page weekly, has a large circulation. The Cru-
mdcr, a sixteen-page monthly, the official organ
of the Loyal Temperance Legion, has a large
and increasing circulation. One thousand
colunms are filled weekly in other newspapers
by two thousand eight hundred and sixteen
superintendents. Thirty-two States publish
State papers devote&lt;l entirely to W. G. T. U.
interests.

The W. C. T. U. has been the chief factor in
State campaigns for statutory prohibition, con-
stitutional amendments, reform laws in gen-
eral, and those for the protection of women and
children in particular, and in securing anti-
gambling and anti-cigarette laws. It has been
instrumental in raising the age of protection
for girls in every State but two. The age is
now eighteen years in thirteen States, sixteen
years in nineteen States, and from twelve to
fifteen years in the other States. Through its



22



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



influence scientific temperance instruction laws
have been secured in every State and Territory.
Curfew laws have been secured in four huntlred
towns and cities. It aided in securing the anti-
canteen amentlment to the army bill, which
prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquors in all
army posts. It secured the appointment of
police matrons, now required in many of the
large cities of the United States. It keeps a
superintendent of legislation in Washington dur-
ing the entire session of Congress, to look after
reform bills.

Eight thousand petitions have lately been
sent by the W. C. T. U. to the physicians of
the United States, asking that their medical
practice and teaching, as well as their personal
example, be upon the side of safety in regard to
the use of alcohol. By petitions and protests
Congressman-elect Roberts, the polygamist, was
prevented from taking his seat in the United
States Congress. Similar elTort was made by
the W. C. T. U. to retire Mr. Smoot, and the
influence of this organization helped to bring
about the Congressional investigation concern-
ing modern Mormonism and polygamy. Because
of protests the prohibitory law in Indian Terri-
tory was not repealed nor openly attacked. For
the same reason the prohibitory constitution of
Maine was not resubmitted. The National
W.C.T.U. secures more petitions than any other
society in the world. It is estimated that not
fewer than twenty million of signatures
and attestations have been secured by the
W. C. T. U., including the polyglot petition.
Other societies work largely through W. C. T. U.
machinery in circulating petitions. The thought
of the polyglot petition originatetl with Miss
Willartl, and it was written by her. It has
seven million signatures and attestations.

The W. C. T. U. will continue to petition for
federal legislation to protect native races in
our own territory and in foreign lands. It will
continue to protest against the bringing of
Chinese girls to this country for immoral pur-
poses, and against the enslaving of the same,
and against the legalizing of all crime, especially
that of prostitution and liquor selling. It will
continue to protest against the sale of li(iuor
in Soldiers' Homes, where an aggregate of two
hundred and fifty-three thousand and twenty-



seven dollars is spent annually for intoxicating
drinks, only about one-fifth of the soldiers'
pension money being sent home to their fami-
lies. It will continue to protest against the
United States government receiving a revenue
for liquors sokl within prohibitory territory,
either local or State, and against all complicity
of the federal government with the liquor traffic.
It will continue to protest against lynching, and
will lend its aid in favor of the enforcement of
law. It will continue to work for the highest
well-being of our soldiers and sailors, and espe-
cially for suitable temperance canteens and
liberal rations.

It will continue to work for the protection of
the home against its enemy, the liquor traffic,
and for the redemption of our government from
this curse, which redemption can only come,
it believes, by the prohibition of the manufact-
ure and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage
pui-poses. It is pledged to the highest interests
of the great institutions of the world — the home,
the school, the Church, the State.



ABBY KELLEY FOSTER was the
/\ descendant of a long line of Quaker
_/ ^ ancestry, English on the mother's
side, Irish on the father's. From the
former came her unflinching determination,
her almost dogged persistence, her unyielding
will where a principle was at stake, her .severe
judgment of all who failed to reach her lofty
stantlards of morality. With the Celtic blood
came her cheerfulness, her ingenuousness, her
childlike simplicity, and utter lack of self-
consciousness. Her inability to keep a secret,
even when of an important character, was the
source of much amusement and occasional
annoyance to lier friends. Of Irish wit she
had not a trace, though she could thoroughly
enjoy a joke when it was explained to her.

Mrs. Foster hail a clear, though perhaps,
an unusual, conception of the distinction be-
tween the possible and the impossible. What-
ever was right and just she firmly believed to
be possible. To right a wrong or to accom-
jilish an important object, she would move
lieaven and earth; but she wasted no energy
in useless repining over the inevitable. It was

this philosophic resignation to the necessary
ills of life, combined with a remarkable elas-
ticity of temperament, which enabled her to
endure the intense nervous strain to which
she was for numy years unavoidably subjected,
and helped to prolong Ijeyond threescore years
and ten a life, in childhood frail, in youth and
middle age constantly overburdened with se-
vere mental and physical t(jil.

Soon after her birth in the little town of
Pelham, Mass., January 15, 1811, her parents,
Wing and Diama (Daniels) Kelley, removed
to Worcester, where the little Abigail, because
of her delicate health, was allowed to grow up
in comparative freedom from the restraint
imposed upon the girls of her day. But, in
spite of this, she used to tell me that she con-
stantly rebelled against the limits set to the
physical activity of girls. She felt it a humili-
ation to be permitted to go on the ice only in
tow of some condescending boy who might offer
to tlrag her behind him by a stick. But she
would climb trees and fences, and coast down
hills on barrel staves, undeterred by the epi-
thets "hoyden" and "tomboy," heaped upon
her by the girls who only played with dolls
in the house. Thus early did she exhibit that
love of freedom which was her leading trait
through life.

Her mother, the strictest of orthodox
Friends, taught her children to follow with
unquestioning obedience the leadings of "the
Spirit," that inner voice which the world calls
conscience. It was to this early training of
the conscience and the will that Mrs. Foster
attributed her moral strength in later life. The
severe discipline of the household was miti-
gated, however, by the genial influence of the
warm-hearted, impulsive father, whose kindly
nature found expression in tender affection
toward his children and aliounding hospitality
to a large circle of friends.

Pecuniary misfortunes reduced the family
income by and by, and put to the test the
character of the young girl who was just now
beginning to realize the serious meaning of
life. She had learned all that the best private
school for girls in Worcester could teach her.
Her parents coukl not afford to sentl her away
to school, so at the age of fourteen she bor-



rowed money of an elder sister to pay her
expenses for a year at the Friends' School in
Providence, R.I. Though not (as she declared)
a brilliant scholar, she was a most faithful
student, often working so hard over her lessons
that the perspiration would stand out on her
face as if from hard physical exertion. She
took a high rank in her class, and was there-
fore able to obtain from her teachers a recom-
mendation which secured her a school the next
year, though she was only fifteen years old.
Having paid her debt and earned a little
beside, she returned to school; and for three
years she alternately taught and studied, until
she had finished the most advanced course of
instruction which New England then offered
to women. From the age of fourteen she
paid all her own expenses.

She was fond of dress, and indulged to the
full in the few frivolities -allowed by her sect,
which did not altogether frown upon rich silks
anil satins, if plainly fashioned and of subdued
tints. Abby (I think she had already dropped
the "gail") had an eminently social nature,
and did not disdain the pomps and vanities of
parties and balls, with their attendant beaux,
among whom her slentler, giaceful figure and
beautiful dancing made her a favorite.

Miss Kelley nmst have been about nineteen
when she went to Lynn, where for several years
she had charge of the private school of the
Friends' Society. It was while here that she
first heard the subject of slavery discussed.
She listened to the burning words of William
Lloyd Garrison and to the strong Quaker utter-
ance of Arnold Buffum. The "inner voice"
began to call to her, and she replied by accept-
ing the secretaryship of the Lynn Female Anti-
slavery Society, just formed. Her own words,
taken from the letter to which I have referred,
give a vivid picture of the strong impression
which the reform had already made upon her.

" From this time I did what I could to carry
forward the work, by circulating petitions to
tur legislative bodies, scattering our publica-
oions, soliciting subscriptions to our journals,
and raising funds for oiu- societies, in the mean-
time by private conversations enforcing our
principles and our measures in season and out
of season, taking more and more of the time

left from my scliool duties. At length my
whole soul was so filled with the subject that
it would not leave me in school hours, and I saw
I was giving to this duty less than its due.
This decided me to resign. I had been wanting
to pass a season with my mother, who was in
failing health. My resignation was not ac-
cepted, but I persisted, and after two more
terms I was released. My mother was in sym-
pathy with me on the slavery question, and I
told her fully the state of my mind, saying
that, but for the fact that I had so little com-
mand of language and no training in public
speaking, I should think I had a divine call
(as understood by Friends) to go forth and
lecture.

"About this time there was a pressbig call
for funds from the anti-slavery societies, anrl
I sold some of tlie most expensive articles of
my wardrobe, and forwarded the proceeds to
the treasury, feeling that I could not withhold
even a feather's weight of help that might
hasten the downfall of the terrible system which,
by crushing and cursing the slave, had de-
prived the whole country of the liberty of
speech and the press, and the right of peaceable
assemblage and petition."

(It should be said at this point that Miss
Kelley had alreadj' given to the society all her
accumulated earnings and the small inheri-
tance recently received from her father's estate.)
" Not long after tliJs, in one of our Scripture read-
ings at breakfast, I read from a chapter con-
taining these words: 'Not many wise men
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
noble, are called: but God hath chosen the
fftolish things of the world to confound the wise;
and God hath chosen the weak things of the
world to confound the things which are mighty;
and base things of the world, and things which
are despised, . . . and things which are not,
to bring to naught things that are: that no
flesh should glory in his presence.' I closed
the book and said to my mother: 'My way is
clear now: a new light has broken on me. How
true it is, as history records, that all great
reforms have been carried forward by weak
and despised means! The talent, the learning,
the wealth, the Church, and the State, are
pledged to the support of slavery. I will go



out among the honest-hearted common people,
into the highways and byways, and cry, "Pity
the poor slave!" if I can do nothing more.'
My mother still hoped that I might be spared
from taking up so heavy a cross;. but I told her
I had counted the cost, and though, as an abo-
litionist, I must take my life in my hand, and,
as a public-speaking woman, must .suffer more
than the loss of life, yet all I could give, and all
I was, was but as dust in the balance, if my
efforts could gain over to our cause a few honest
souls.

"I had a sister living in Connecticut, who
was quite in accord with me, and at her house
I now made my home, going out as oppor-
tunities were offered me by the few abolitionists
of that vicinity. I was entirely unknown and
uidicard of, except as some New York paper,
in its denunciation and ridicule of the anti-
slavery meetings, might refer to me as 'that
monstrosity, a public-speaking woman.' I had
no endorsement from any society, none but
a few of my most intimate friends knowing of
my purpose. The reason for my going out
thus was my doubt of being able to serve the
great cause in this way; and I did not wish
to involve any other person in the trials, perils,
and tribulations to which I should be liable."

Miss Kelley finally received an invitation to
hold meetings in Washington, Conn. She says
of them: "The first meeting was well attended,
and another was called for, then still another
and another, each with deepening interest
and larger attendance. When a fifth was pro-
po.sed, as I had engagements elsewhere, I
promised to return in two weeks and speak
again. It may seem remarkable that no oppo-
sition was manifested; but those who invited
me were all members of the church, and Mr.
Gunn was the superintendent of the Sabbath-
school, and Mr. Piatt a sheriff of the county. . . .
I was treated with much consitleration, receiv-
ing hospitality from those who stood first and
best. But, when I returned, lo, what a change!
Mr. and Mrs. Gunn met me with sorrowful
faces and told me that in my absence Mr. H.,
the minister, had preached a sermon from the
text. Rev. ii. 20: 'I have a few things against
thee, because thou sufferest that woman
Jezebel to teach and to seduce my servants.' . . .

He set forth the powers and artifices of Jezebel,
her learning, her marvellous blandishments,
with the neglect of the minister to forbid her
preaching until she had acquired such an influ-
ence that he daretl not interfere. Then Mr.
H. charged that another Jezebel had arisen,
and, with fascinations exceeding even those of
her Scripture prototype, was aiming to entice
and destroy this church. ... He added: 'Do
any of you ask for evidence of her vile character?
It needs no other evidence than the fact that
in the face of the clearest commands of God,
" IjCt your women keep silence in the churches,
for it is not permittetl unto them to speak,"
she comes here with brazen face, a servant
of Satan in the garb of an angel of light, and
tramples this connnand under her feet.' This
is the purport of his discourse as reported
to me.

"My friends invited me to go with them to
the weekly prayer-meeting that afternoon.
We hoped, though with little faith, to have
an opportunity for my friend to say a few words
in reply to the Sunday's sermon. But no one
was allowed to speak except by the minister's
invitation, and the meeting was soon closed.
We stood near the door as the i)eople passed
out. With one exception, not one of those
whom I had met on my first visit, not even those
who had hospitably entertained me, gave me
a hand or a look, but all passed me as if I hatl
been a block. I doubt not that many of the
members of that church thanketl Mr. H. for
his timely warning, by which they were saved
from being led to death and hell. At my lect-
ure that evening few were present, and tho.se
mainly from surrounding towns. I went to
my chamber that night, but not to sleep. In
agony of prayer and tears, my cry was, 'Oh
that my head were waters, and mine eyes a
fountain of tears, that I might weep day and
night for the slain of the daughter of my people! '
My anguish was not because of anything per-
sonal to myself, but because I was thus cut
off from the people who might rise up for the
defence of the slave. The friends at whose
house I was stood by me nobly, but we all
saw that nothing more could be done at that
time.

"Soon after this I was invited to speak in



Torrington, where a Methodist church was
opened to me, the minister being absent. I
remained there about a week, holding several
meetings, which created great interest, so that
people came in from surrounding towns. There
were many questions asked and answered,
but very little opposition was apparent. At
one of the last meetings, though nothing had
been said about money, the people in passing
out left contril)utions on the desk before me.
No one said a word except an aged man, who,
dropping a gold coin, remarked, 'The laborer
is worthy of his hire.' The amount was sev-
eral dollars.

"When I started on my mission, my funds
were low. I could not ask for help, but de-
cided that, when my supply should fail, it would
be sufhcient reason for my going home. At one
time I had but ten cents left in my purse, ant!
was about to write home for a loan, when a
letter from an intimate friend was brought me,
containing a five-dollar bill."

Among the iJaces which Miss Kelley visited
was Norfolk, Conn. Arriving in the absence
of her host, several of the principal men of the
town called on her, and informetl her with
threats that if she persisted in her attempt
it would be at her own peril. With no friend
at hand she had to yield; but it was Saturday
night, and she could not get away before Mon-
day. Her hostess was evidently in sympathy
with the mob element, and Miss Kelley there-
fore tried to get lodgings at the hotel. She
was told that the innkeeper would as willingly
entertain the vilest woman from New York
as herself. "Language," she writes, "cannot
ilescribe that long day and night of spiritual
anguish and utter desolation." Monthly morn-
ing saw her depart. She went to the house
of a friendly Quaker farmer in Canaan. "Once
more I breathed freely. A terrible burden fell
off me. When left alone I went into the or-
chanl back of the house" (remeniber she was
still young, only about twenty-five) "and ran
about like a colt let loose. I hopped, skipped,
and danced. I climbetl the trees and sang with
the birds. Such ecstasies of delight come
rarely."

In this town she held good meetings, but in
Salisbury her meeting was broken up by a



26



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



mob which rang the church hell, tooted tin
horns, and beat on tin pans.

At Cornwall Bridge Miss Kelley barely es-
caped personal injury. The politics of the
town were controlled liy a charcoal manufact-
urer, a drunken, profane fellow, who had a
similar following. "When we entered the
house, we found it well filled and lighted, with
a candle on the desk, and several candles and
oil lamps on the box stove in the centre. The
audience appeared respectable; but from with-
out smutty faces looked in through the open
windows, and ominous mutterings were heard.
Directly there strode in a burly, led-faced
fellow, with glaring eyes, who brandished a
huge club, shouting with an oath, 'Where's
the nigger wench?' A shudder ran through
me. A feeble, trembling voice in a far corner
of the room replied, 'Perhaps she has not
come.' Down fell his club, right and left, jKit-
ting out and smashing lamps and candles.
That on the desk followed in an instant, while
I was seized by my friends, and in the dark-
ness was hurried to the door, amid the sounds
of the falling club, the screams of the wounded,
and the horrible oaths of the drunken wretch."
Another attempt to hold a meeting was foiled
by the appearance of this man with a loaded
gun.

If anything more than the terrible campaign
in Connecticut were needed to convince Miss
Kelley that she had a divine call for public
speaking, it was found in the effect produced
by the short but eloquent appeal which she
made in Pennsylvania Hall, Philadelphia, on
the memorable evening of its destruction at
the hands of a pro-slavery mob, May IG, 1838.
At the close of that meeting, her friend, Theo-
dore D. Weld, strongly urged her to join the
lecture corps, adding, "Abby, if you don't,
God will smite you." But, before a woman
could go forth as the accredited agent of the
Anti-slavery Society, a battle had to be fought
within its own ranks. Witness a letter dic-
tated by Mrs. Foster two or three years licfore
her death: —

" Long before there was any organized move-
ment in behalf of the equal rights of women,
the battle for the recognition of their equality
was fought and won, as an incidental issue,



on the anti-slavery platform. In 1837 Sarah
and Angelina (irimke, of South Carolina, were
invited to New England to lecture to women
on slavery. Meetings were appointed for them
in Boston, at which a few men looked in from
the vestibule, and finally entered ami took
seats. No objections being made to this in-
vasion, their sub.seciuent meetings were, largely
attended by men as well as women. Meetings
were held in many towns in New England, fre-
quently in influential churches, the pastors
opening with prayer and otherwise giving coun-
tenance to the movement. Among the most
important hearings given the Grimkes were
those before the Legislature of Massachusetts,
on petitions. They created an interest that
had never been felt before, as witness the
action of the Congregational A.'jsociation, which
in 1838, by a pastoral letter, written by a com-
mittee of which the Rev. Nehemiah Adams
was chairman, warned its various churches
against giving countenance to women's speak-
ing in public assemblies, a movement which
was anti-scriptural, umiatural, indecent, and
ruinous to the best interests of the comnuuiity.

"These lectures and the action of the Con-
gregational Association resulted in a great agi-
tation, extending throughout New England,
especially in the anti-slavery ranks. No
woman hail hitherto taken part in a mixed
convention of any of the anti-slavery societies
by speaking or serving on committees; but in
May, 1838, at the New England Convention,
Abby Kelley said a few words from her seat
in the hall, and was afterward nominated and
elected a member of a conmiittee to memorial-
ize the religious associations of Massachusetts
in regard to slavery.

"This action, hastily taken in the closing
moments of the first .evening, was next day
violently opposed by ministers ami others,
among them several who had been prominent
in aiding the Grinike sisters in their mixed
meetings, but who now, under the influence
of the i)astoral letter and hostile jiublic .senti-
ment, had joined the opposition. These mem-
bers, having in vain requested Miss Kelley
to withdraw from the connnittee, introduced
a resolution excusing her from serving. An
intensely exciting discussion followed. The



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



27



resolution was defeated, a large majority taking
tlic ground that women, being members of the
society, were entitled to all the rights, privi-
leges, and duties pertaining to membership. In
May, 1839, the question again came up, this
time at the annual meeting of the American
Anti-slavery Society, in New York. An excit-
ing discussion followeil the appointment of
Miss Kelley to a committee, the fiuestion being
decided as before. The next year it was set-
tled, once for all, that in the American Anti-
slavery Society and its auxiliaries throughout
the country the women should take part as
freely as the men in all the work of the public
meetings, even to the point of presiding on
important occasions."

It was in 1839 that Miss Kelley's recognized
career as a lecturer began. She had alreatiy
been baptized with the terrible flame of per-
secution in the solitary Connecticut campaign,
and whatever of abuse and vilification now
assailed her she could bear with comparative
equanimity, supported by the strong band of
brave and loyal souls who had pledged to the
cause of the slave their lives, their fortunes,
and their sacred honor. From this time till
her marriage, in 1845, Miss Kelley devoted
herself untiringly to anti-slavery work. She
spoke in conventions not only, but nuide long
trips through remote country districts, speak-
ing in churches, whenever they could be ob-
tained; when not, in school-hou.ses. Some-
times arrangements were made by the society's
agent; but she often had to be her own agent,
learning from her last host who in the surround-
ing towns would help her to get up meetings,
and who would receive her at their houses, for
she had no money to pay hotel bills. For
many years she received no salary, her trav-
elling expenses only being paid by the society,
and her most pressing needs for clothing being
supplied by her friends. Many annising anec-
dotes might be related of these lecture tours.
She, like Dickens, was given her choice of
"corn bread and common doin's" or "white
bread and chicken fixin's." In the new settle-
ments of the West, where the kitchen sink or
the well was the common bath-room for the
family, and a single dish (sometimes the iron
skillet) served each in turn as a wash-basin,



her hostesses discovered that an occult con-
nection existed between a woman lecturer
and a pan of water — a luxury which Miss Kelley
always insisted upon having in her room. In
those days of pork and bacon it was extremely
difficult to get suitable food, but eggs and
potatoes could usually be obtained. Travelling
was a terrible undertaking. At first no rail-
roatls, then only a few between the larger cities,
stage-coaches or wagons, and roails of every
degree of muddiness or roughness, with the
corduroy road of logs as the extreme of torture —
these were the only means of conveyance for
the pioneers of the anti-slavery cause.

About the time that Abby Kelley became
known to the public, another lecturer appeared
on the anti-slavery platform, one who exciteil
more animosity, if less ridicule, than she. This
was Stephen S. Foster, who out-Garrisoned
even the famous leader. In his ability to por-
tray in vivid anil terrible language the sin of
the sla\T-holder and the wickedness of the
church and clergy in lending countenance
to the system, he was without a rival. No
meeting was dull where he spoke. Indeed, a
mob was the not imjirobable outcome, before
which Mr. Foster never quailed. A non-
resistant, he carried always with him two
invaluable weapons — a piercing eye, with which
he transfixetl liis assailants, and a wonderful
magnetic power, which enabled him to hokl an
audience, though they writhed under his ter-
rible denunciations. But he was sometimes
roughly handled, and several times received
serious injuries.

This brave martyr spirit was the mate for
whom destiny had preserved Abby Kelley
from her many youthful adn\irers. Marriage
had never attracted her; for marriage, at that
time, meant the absolute submission of the
wife, her entire loss of identity. To such a
union such a woman could never consent. But
when this wooer came there was a difference.
The great principle of human freedom which
he applied to the black slave he applied also
to the white woman, who was a subject, if not
a chattel. He had the same great cause at heart
as Miss Kelley. Like her, he had labored with-
out money and without price, had given up
his profession ami his creed for the slave. Mar-

riage to such a man seoined to her the realiza-
zation of an ideal, and so it proved. But
there was one condition: three entire years
must be devoted to the sacred cause. So the
travellinj;; and lecturing went on. T^p and
down, from Maine to Ohio, always with some
woman for a travelling companion. Miss Kelloy
toiled almost without rest. One sununer she
spoke every day for six weeks and sometimes
twice a day. The meetings (some of them
large conventions) were often held in groves,
and it was this severe strain which broke the
voice, before so strong and clear.

In December, 1845, Abby Kelley and Stephen
S. Foster were married. For a year or two
previously they had consented to receive the
small salary then usually paid to lecturei's.
They felt that they owed something to the
new relation and duties they were soon to
assume. Mr. P''oster had also realized some-
thing from an anti-slavery work which he wrote
about that time. With this small sum the
husband and wife purchased a farm in the
suburbs of Worcester, Mass., which continued
to be their home till Mr. Foster's death in 1881.
But their public work was not given up. Mr.
Foster was usually absent during the winter
on lecturing tours, while Mrs. Foster made
several long campaigns in the West, besides
often attending conventions or giving lectures
nearer home. When asked how she could
bear to leave her little daughter, she would
reply, " I leave my child in wise and loving
hands and but for a little, while the slave
mothers daily have their daughters torn from
their arms and sold into torture and infamy."

Never was mother more devoted, more self-
sacrificing than she. Had she been less noble,
less brave, less tender of her child, she would
have remained at home to enjoy her mother-
hood at the expense of other mothers. She
once exclaimed, "The most precious legacy
I can leave my child is a free country!"

It was about this time that the woman's
rights cause came up as an independent reform.
Mrs. Foster had fought the battle for the right
of women to speak in public, and had gained
it for herself and for all women. Now came
the broader cpiestion of the right to vote,
which involves all other rights. She was ear-



nest in its advocacy, and came to see th;it it
was a much more comprehensive reform than
even the anti-slavery movement. But she
felt that her life was consecrated to the slave,
and that her failing voice and broken health
nuist be husbanded for that service. Yet she
was thoroughly identified with the suffrage
movement, and was recognized, with the
Grimkes, as the pioneer who, with bleeding
feet, smoothed the path through which the
women of the suffrage movement might lead
their sex to the light.

Mrs. Foster's last jniblic work was devoted
to raising money for rousing public sentiment
to the necessity of carrying the Fifteenth
Amendment. With the other loyal friends of
the freedmen, she felt that freedom without the
ballot was an empty name. She could no
longer speak from the platform, but her earnest
pleading in private rarely failed to convince
her listener that justice was the only safe
course for the nation to pursue. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of dollars were contributed
through her to be spent in holding meetings
throughout the North and in publishing and
distributing documents for the enlightenment
of the public. This amendment at last carried,
she felt that she had at last earned a discharge
from the army of workers.

Those who listened to Abby Kelley in the
days of her young womanhood have told me of
her wonderful power. This consisted, I imag-
ine, in her intense earnestness, in her utter
self-forgetfulness and consecration. Her lan-
guage was of Quaker simplicity, unadorned
with figures or imagery. She never wrote
her speeches, and rarely spent any time in their
l)reparation ; but the eloquence of a heart on
fire, words lighted at the altar of Cod's truth,
were hers. Her audience felt that she " re-
membered those in bonds as bountl with them."
Such a passion for freedom, such unselfish
devotion, could not fail to inspire admiration
and win converts.

Though Miss Kelley's featiires were not beau-
tiful, she had an attractive personality. Her
lithe, graceful figure was crowned with a head
of fine outlines, well poised on a beautiful neck,
and covered with abundant dark brown hair,
hardly gray, even at her death. The Quaker

kerchief, laid in folds around her neck, was tlie
one article of personal adornment to which she
clung. Its simplicity was perhaps its special
charm, so completely did it harmonize with
the purity and sincerity of the wearer.

Mrs. Foster was noted far and near for her
good housekeeping. She had had almost, no
experience in this department before her lijar-
riage, but (as she confided to me a short time
before her death) she was tletermined to dis-
prove the assertion that- a "strong-minded
woman" would, of course, neglect her house
and family. As a poor farmer's wife. sfee had
a hard task, but she accomplished it- success-
fully, though her health was often far from
robust. From kitchen to jjlatform was per-
haps not an easy transition, yet it was one
which she often ma&lt;le with little apparent _diffi-
cuity. .. ■ .

The five years of Mrs. Foster's life from 1876
to 1881 were saddened by the illness, of her
husband, which was attended with intense
suffering and which terminated fatally. But
throughout this time of trial and for the suc-
ceetling five years preceding her own death,
January 14, 1887, her brave and cheerful spirit
triumphed over her frail body, and she lived
on the serene heights, happy in the conscious-
ness of a life well spent and ready for that im-
mortal existence which she was convinced
would bring her renewed strength and further
opportunity to work toward the ultimate good
which to her meant God.

A sketch of Mrs. Foster would be incomplete
without a word upon the character of her hus-
band, which cannot be better said than by his
lifelong friend, Parker Pillsbury, in his "Acts
of the Anti-.slavery Apostles ":-7-

" Distinguished abolitionists were often called
men with one idea. Anti-slavery, in its im-
measurable importance to all the interests of the
country, material, mental, moral, and social,
as well as religious and political, was one idea
far too great for ordinary minds, even without
any other. But the sturdy synnnetry and con-
sistency of Mr. Foster's character were as won-
ilerful as were his vigor and power in any one
direction. Earliest and bravest among the
temperance reformers, when even that cause
was almost as odious as anti-slavery became



afterward; a radical advocate of peace from
the standpoint of the Sermon on the Mount,
'Resist not evil,' seconded by the apostolic
injunction, 'Avenge not yourselves'; a cham-
pion in the woman suffrage enterprise from
its inception; an intelligent, earnest advocate
of the rights of labor and deeply interested in
•all the moral, social, and philanthropic associ-
ations of the city and neighl)orhood where he
lived — he left behind hini a record ami a mem-
ory to grow brighter as the years sweep on. . . .
The beauty and harmony of his home were-
unsurpassed. It was sacred to peace and love.
Its unostentatious Ixut elegant antl generous
hospitality was the admiration of all who ever
enjoyed it."

James Russell Low.ell, in a rh}-nied letter
descriptive of the principal figures in the anti-
slavery^ bazaar hehl. in; Boston in 1840, pays
a charming tribute to Mrs. Foster; —

" A Judith there, tinned Quakeie.ss,
Sits Abby in her modest dress,
Serving a table quietl}',
As if tliat mild and downcast eye
Flashed never with its scorn intense,
•More than Medea's eloquence.

No nobler gift than heart or brain.
No. life more white from spot or stain,
Was e'er on Freedom's altar laid
Than hers — the simple Quaker maid."

Alla Wright Foster.



LURA CHASE PARTINGTON, the first
woman to hold the office of Grand
_J Worthy Patriarch of the Grand Divi-
sion of Maine, Sons of Temperance,
is a native of the State of Maine. She was
born in Cornville, Somerset County, August 11,
1831, daughter of Reuben Moore and Lydia
Hewitt (Woodcock) Smiley.

Her father was born in Sidney, Me., De-
cember 10, 1803. He died in Gardiner, Me.,
September 7, 1882. Seven of his ancestral
kin were niin\ite-men of the Re^olution. His
father, William Smiley, born in Sidney, No-
vember 30, 1757, was the son of Hugh and
Marcy (Park) Smylie, who were married Octo-
ber 23, 1745. Marcy was the daughter of



30



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Alexander Park, ulio died January 26, 1760,
and "Margrat" Park, who died May 11, 1752.
William Smiley lived to the age of ninety-
seven years, his death being caused by an acci-
dent. He had a sister who reached the age of
one hundred and two, well known as "Aunt
Sally Webber." Sarah Moore Smiley, the
wife of William, died several years before her
husband; and her funeral was attended by
their fourteen children. Seven of these chil-
dren lived to be nearly eighty years old, and
one, a daughter, died at the age of ninety-six.

The Smiley armorial ensign was conferred
upon the ancestors of one John Smylie, barris-
ter, resident of Dulilin. Ireland, probalily in
the seventeenth century.

Description: "Azure a chevron, ermine, be-
tween three pheons, argent; for crest, on a
wreath of the colors, an armed arm embowed
proper, the hand holding a pheon by the point
thereof, gules; and for motto, Virihuf&lt; virhtf;."

Explanation: The chevron, or saddle bow.
denotes military valor. The crest, aliove the
wreath, is a mark of special honor. The armed
arm signifies courage or might, and was prob-
ably awarded for great liravery. The wreath
is symbolic of a victor. The pheons, or iron
dart-heads, indicate royalty or defence of
crown property. Azure (blue) denotes inno-
cence; ermine (argent tufted with black), dig-
nity; argent (white), purity; gules (red), cour-
age. The motto means \^alor in arms, or \'irtue
with power.

Mrs. Lydia H. Smiley, Mrs. Partington's
mother, was the daughter of Liberty and Su-
sannah Woodcock. Born in Winthrop, Me.,
March 2, 1804, she died March 25, 1865. Mrs.
Partington says of her: "She was a perfect
housekeeper and a devoted mother. She be-
lieved that children should obey their parents,
and not parents obey their children. When
I was three years old, she sent me to the infant
Sabbath-school. I was given a little card with
one verse on it for my lesson. Monday morn-
ing I wanted to go out and play with my little
playmates, but mother said I nuist get one
line of my lesson first. I began to think tliat
Sabbath-school was a nuisance, and I replied,
'I'm not going any more.' Mother said, 'Yes,
you vill go'; and I knew that I'd have to go.



She taught me one line of my verse every day,
and then had me repeat the whole verse till
I could say it perfectly. Of my mother's an-
cestry I know but little. They were of Scotch
descent, and many of them in the Revolution-
ary W'ar."

While living in Gardiner, Me., Reuben M.
.Smiley was warden of the Episcopal church
and leader of the choir. He was one of the or-
ganizers of the Sons of Temperance in Maine.
His daughter Lura attended the Gardiner pub-
lic schools until she was twelve years old, then
was sent to a private school or academy in
Gardiner called the "Lyceum." When only
six years old, .she signed the pledge at a tem-
perance meeting in the Methodist Kpiscopal
church in Gardiner, Me., and two years later
she joined the "Cold W'ater Army," which was
then popular throughout the country. In
1846, the family having removed that year to
Lowell, Mass., where her father was engaged
in putting turbine wheels into the mills, she
there joined the Daughters of Temperance, and,
although so very young, was chosen chaplain
of the L'nion. This society was afterward
merged in the Sons of Temperance. She has
held an unbroken membership for fifty-six
years, and is now (1903) Grand Worthy Patri-
arch of the Grand Division of Maine.

In 1849 she joined the Baptist church in
Lowell, of which the Rev. Daniel C. Eddy was
pastor. In 1851 her parents moved to Port-
land, Me. This city she has ever since called
her* home, although temporarily residing in
New York and other cities.

On March 7, 1853, she married Jo.«eph Part-
ington, a native of Islington Parish, London.
Born August 9, 1831, he came to this covmtry
when seven years old, and settled in New York,
but moved to Portland in 1851.

Mr. Partington was a thorough American,
and when the Civil War broke out he enlisted
in the Twenty-fifth Maine Regiment, com-
manded by Colonel Francis Fessenilen. This
regiment having completed the nine months'
service for which it enlisted, Mr. Partington
again joine'd the army, this time with a three
years' regiment, the Thirtieth Maine, which
was commanded by the same colonel, who
afterward became a prominent general. Mr.

Partington saw active service in Louisiana and
Texas, and was also with Sheridan's anny at
Winchester. He reniained with the Thirti-
eth until its consolidation with other regiments,
when he was honorably discharged and re-
turned home. Owing to tiie hardships of army
life Mr. Partington's health failed, and he died
December 13, 1867. He was a member of the
Chestnut Street Methodist Episcopal Church
in Portland. Mrs. Partington also joined that
church after their marriage, and she retains
her membership therein.

In the spring of 1S61 Mrs. Partington united
with the Intlependent Order of Good Templars,
joining Arcana I&gt;odge, of Portland, the first
lodge organized in the vState. She has retained
her membership and interest for more than
forty years. Elected Grand Worthy Vice-
Templar of the State in the early days of the
order, she organized lodges and conducted
effective missionary work. In 1871 she was
engaged in gospel temperance work in Eng-
land, giving many lectures. Returning home
in the fall of 1872, she was chosen State dele-
gate to the International Supreme Lodge, In-
dependent Onler of Good Templars, whicli met
in London early in 1873. At the close of its
sessions she was engaged by the Hon. Joseph
Malins, the head of the order, as Grand Lodge
lecturer for England. For more than two
years she contiuned her work in England,
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, lecturing to
crowded and appreciative audiences. Among
pleasant incidents she related the following: —

"While travelling through Ireland, I stopped
at a little whitewashed cottage, and asked if
the woman living there could give me a supper
of bread and milk. The woman replied, 'Walk
in and sit down in j'our own place.' As I en-
tered, I noticed in the centre of the room a
large pine table, around which the family had
gathered. The only chairs at the table were
the ones occupied by the father and mother.
The three elder children were seated upon
stools, while the two younger were standing.
Yet at the table was an empty stool, and before
it a plate turned down. That was what the.
woman had calletl my 'own place.' I asked
her why she had called it my place. She re-
plied, 'We have a little superstition that, if



we always keep the stranger's j)late on our
table, the dear Lord will always sentl enough
to fill ours. And he generally does,' she added.
It was a beautiful thought, and it would be
well if we followed the example of that poor
Irish peasant woman.

"While in Scotland I was invitetl Ui speak
ill Lord Kinnard's castle. There I had an
audience which never would have come to any
public hall. They all seemed interested and
well pleased. I spent five weeks on the Isle
of Jersey, the guest of Sir Philip de Carteret,
the last of that old baronial family."

While abroad, she was the recipient of many
gifts, among them elegant regalia from
friends in Ireland. On her first trip to Edin-
burgh she lecturetl seventy-four consecutive
nights, and conducted services four times on
Sunday. On her second visit, when leaving
the city, she was escorted to the station by a
band of music; and, as the train rolled away,
sixty members of the band united in singing
"Will ye no' come back again?" A local
paper thus referred to her meetings: "Mrs.
L. C. Partington, of Portland, Me., one of the
representatives of the recent Right Worthy
Grand Lodge session, has again visited Edin-
burgh. Although upon this occasion an in-
valid, seeking rest, she managed during her
nine days' visit to address with great accept-
ance nineteen meetings, and left with the cry
ringing in her ears, ' Will 3'e no' come back
again?'" The Dundee Courier reported her
lectures, and added: "Dundee is enjoying a
rich treat in listening to the stirring addresses
of Mrs. Partington, of Portland, United States.
The enthusiasm with which she is everywhere
received increa,ses nightly. . . . Her whole heart
is in the work." The Londonderry (Ireland)
Neivs and the Ballymena (Ireland) Advertiser
referred in complimentary terms to her work,
the editor of the latter stating that he had
never heard " better argument or more con-
vincing and eloquent advocacy of any cause."

Upon returning again to America, Mrs. Part-
ington travelled in twenty-two States, giving
lectures from Maine to California. The Balti-
more American said of her: "One of the largest
and most enthusiastic temperance meetings
ever held in this city was conducted by Mrs.

Partington. She proved herself to be one of
the best speakers in the cause of temperance
that have ever appeared in Baltimore, and
spoke with an earnestness, distinctness, pathos,
and Inmior that held the close attention of the
assemljlage to the last."

In her own State; her friends are legion; and
the Portland Transcript voiced the sentiments
of all when it declared that "among the many
sjx'aker!^ none made a deeper impression than
Mrs. Partington, of this city."

In recent years Mrs. Partington has devoted
most of her time to furthering temperance in-
struction among the children. She is District
Su])erintendent of the Juvenile Templars in
Cumberland County, Maine. On her seven-
tieth birthday she was given a public recep-
tion in Portland, which v/as largely attended.
Among the many gifts of love and resi)ect
which the occasion called forth is an "Illus-
trated Life of Queen Victoria" from the Juve-
nile Templars.

Since the first organization of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union she has been an
active member. Her name is on the roll of
the Union in Brooklyn, N.Y., where she often
makes her headquarters. She is rei)resenta-
tive at large from Kings County Union, and
has held other positions of responsibility.

P^or several years Mrs. Partington has been
a member of the Woman's Rcli(-f Corps, auxil-
iary to the Grand Army of the Republic. Pro-
gressive and patriotic, she is a firm believer
in the principles of eqviality and justice, and
takes a deep interest in all the prominent (jues-
tions of the day. She is a cheerful coiupan-
ion and a loyal friend. When she was four-
teen years old, she became aceiuainted with
Lucy Stone, whose influence, she says, was
an" inspiration which has helped her through
life.

Mrs. Partington has one son, Frederick Eugene,
l)orn May 18, 1S54. Her only daughter, Har-
riet Davis, born Septendwr 28, 185S, died when
three years and six months old.

Frederick I^ugene Partington, after several
years at the high school of Portland, went
abroad with his mother, and travelled two
years, spending the winters in Brussels. He at-
tended .school and studied (he French language



in Paris. After his return he became a teacher
in Pike Seminary, New York, and later he
taught in Goshen, N.Y. Entering Brown
University, Providence, R.I., in 1875, he was
graduated in the class of 1879, of which he Wiis
chosen class historian. He then went to Ger-
many, where he studied for a year and a half.

In 1881 he accepte&lt;l a position as principal
of New Paltz Academy, New York. After
the building was burned, in 1884, he was
chosen i)rincii)al of Staten Island Academy,
now one of the most popular educational in-
stitutions in New York. Through the efforts
of Mr. Partington a new building has been
erected, valued at seventj'-five thousand dollars.

Mr. Partington is a writer and lecturer upon
educational topics. He has crossed the ocean
many times, visiting Greece, Asia Minor, and
other foreign countries; and his lectures upon
his travels are very popular, especially the one
on "The Land of the Midnight Sun."

On June 12, 1890, he married Miss Elizabeth
Hamilton Baten\an, of Portland, who was edu-
cated at Mount Holyoke Seminary.



EVELYN GREENLEAF SUTHER-
IjAND, writer, playwright, and critic,
the only daughter of James Baker, for-
merly a prominent wholesale merchant
of Boston, and his wife, Rachel Arnold Green-
leaf, was born and breil in Boston, as were her
paternal ancestors for three or four generations.
Her mother, who died in 1896, was a daughter
of Spencer and Pamela (Adams) Greenleaf, of
AViscasset, Me.

Mrs. Sutherland is descended on both sides
from fighting stock, and inherits many inter-
esting traditions. Her mother's paternal ances-
try she traces to Captain P^dniund Greenleaf,
who came from England and settled at New-
bury in 1635, the line being; Edmund,'
Stephen,^ ^ * Samuel,'^ Benjamin," Spencer.'
Edmund Greenleaf marched against the Ind-
ians in 1637. From that time to the death in
1857 of her grandfather, Spencer Greenleaf
who served in the War of 1812, there was but
one break in the military service of the family.
Captain Stephen^ Greenleaf, son of Captain
Edmund,' was one of the purchasers of Naii-

33



tucket island in 1659. He niairied in 1651
Elizabeth, daughter of Tristram ("ofhn, tlieii
of Newbury, Mass., afterward the chief magis-
trate, also one of the owners of Nantucket.
Ste})hen- Greenleaf was drowned while engaged
in the honorable discharge of liis military iluty
in the expedition against Port Royal in Decem-
ber, 1690. His son, Stephen,^ known as the
"great Indian fighter," was engaged in King
Philip's War, and in the contest with the French
anil Indians in 1090 he commanded a companj'
at Wells, Me. Mrs. Sutherland's great-grand-
fathei', Benjamin" Greenleaf, was a soldier in
the Revolution.

Several of these progenitors were seafarers,
and were well known in New England as mas-
ter ship-builders. It is recordetl that the origi-
nal Greenleafs in England, ancestors of Edmund,
were Huguenots (name in French Feuillevert),
who had fled from France to escape religious
persecution.

There is a tradition that one of the family,
many generations back, while in France, mar-
ried a Spanish Romany girl, or Gitana, and
that the Gipsy blood now and then appears in
her descendants. To this inheritance Mrs.
Sutherland whimsically attributes her love of
Bohemia and the freedom of outdoor life.

Noteworthy also is the part which the
colonial Bakers took in the cause of liberty.
Captain Joseph Baker, a surveyor, shared in
the famous Lovewell hght in New Hamp-
shire. His wife Hannah was the only daugh-
ter of the noted Captain John Lovewell, who
was killed in the battle of Pigwacket, May 8,
1725. Mrs. Baker received a share in the
lands awardetl to the survivors and heirs of
those engaged in the fight, and .settled with
her husband on this land, where the Baker
homestead now stands, in the town of Pem-
broke, N.H. Their son, Jose]jh Baker, Jr.,
was a soldier in the Revolution, and was
on the Conunittee of Safety for the town of
Bow, N.H.

As shown by family records and remem-
brances, supplementing the genealogy in the
i?.s.sex Antiquarian, vol. ii., Mrs. Sutherland's
maternal grandmother, Pamela Adams Green-
leaf, was a daughter of Nathan Adams and his
wife, Johanna Batchelder, and a descendant in



the sixth generation of Robert Adams and his
wife Eleanor, early .settlers of Newbury, Mass.
From Robert' the line continued through his
son Abraham,-' who married Mary Pettingell;
Abraham,' and his wife Anne, daughter of
William and Anne (Sewall) Longfellow and
niece of Judge Sewall; and Henry^ and his first
wife, Sarah Emery, who were the parents of
Nathan^ Adams, of Newbury, Mass., and Wis-
casset, Me.

James Baker, of Boston, was a devoted anti-
slavery worker and a warm personal friend of
Theodore Parker. He died when his daughter
I'^velyn was only three years of age. Her edu-
cation was carefully looked after by her mother,
her earliest training being received in the pub-
lic schools. She was later placed in the quaint
little "dame" school of Miss Rebecca Lincohi
on Pinckney Street, where the old house is still
standing. She next attended Miss Caroline
Johnson's celebrated school on Ashburton
Place, completing her education by two years'
study in Geneva, Switzerland. She showed
literary tastes when but a child, by writing
little rhymes and tales; and at the age of fifteen
she was awarded a prize for an essay on "What
is a Gentleman?" by Our Young Folka, now
known as Si. Nicholas. Since then her writings,
ver.se or pro.se, have been much before the pub-
lic, appearing in Puck, Life, the Cotiniopolitan,
and other magazines. In 1894, under the name
of Dorothy Lundt, a nam de plume which she
used for twenty years, she won one of the
prizes offered by McClure'f^ Magazine by an
army tale, "Diccon's Dog." Through this
little product of her pen has come a happy ex-
perience. A noted novelist, at a reception
shortly after the publication of the story,
spoke of it in highest praise, not knowing that
she was addressing the author herself. A con-
fession followed, and the friendship thus begun
between the two women has been lasting.

For many years Mrs. Sutherland was a writer
on the staff of the Boston Transcript, from
the autunm of 1887 contributing to its colunuis
both book reviews and draniartic criticisms.
Her success in the latter line is well known.
She heartily attributes all cretlit for what she
has acconiplishetl in dramatic criticism to her
training under Mr. Francis Jenks, for many



;j4



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



years the dramatic editor of the Transcript.
In her first assignment under Mr. Jenks he
gave her a lesson which served as a basis for
all her future work in that line. He asked,
"Do you know what the word critic means?"
Somewhat confused, she answered, "Perhaps
not in the sense you mean." "Go to the dic-
tionary and find out," he said. She found the
original Greek word meant one who discerns.
Mr. Jenks said, tersely, "Always bear that in
mind, and don't confuse the discerner with
the fault-finder." Under his teaching her abili-
ties developetl, and in 1889 and 1890, while
Mr. William Apthorp was in Europe, she wrote
most of the first-night criticisms for the Tran-
script. During her connection with the Tran-
script she conducted a very interesting column
called "Library and Foyer," signed "Dorothy
Lundt." It was original and cle.ver, and was
much appreciated by Transcript readers. Her
work on this paper continued uninterruptedly
for seven years, when, in 1894, she suffered
from acute nervous prostration, and for eleven
months lived out of the city and retired from
active life. Upon her return she was greatly
shocked to learn of the recent sudden death
of her beloved "Father in Journalism," Mr.
Jenks.

For a number of years Mrs. Sutherland was
dramatic editor of the Boston Conuno)ncealth,
and since her return to active work, in 1896,
has contributed to many newspapers, being
dramatic critic of the Daily Journal for several
years. Most of her time, however, has been
occupied with another line of work, that of
short story and play writing. One of her first
plays presented was given performance at the
Hollis Street Theatre in October, 1895, by
Charles Frohman's Empire Theatre Company.
It was a one-act Southern play, entitled "Mars'r
Van," and was written in collaboration with
Mrs. Emma Sheritlan Fry. It afterward ran
for four weeks at the Empire Theatre, New
York, and was also successfully given through-
out the West. " Rohan the Silent" was written
for Alexander Salvini, and was accepted by
him, to be used in connection with "The Fool's
Revenge," which it was his intention to in-
clude in his repertoire for the season of 1896
and 1897. It was produced by him at a trial



performance at the Tremont Theatre, Boston,
May 28, 1896, and it is a notable fact that
Rohan was the last role ever created by this
actor of great promise. "Fort Frayne," her
next attempt, an emotional drama in four acts,
was written in collaboration with Mrs. Fry
and General Charles King. Its possibilities as
a novel appealed to General King, and, with
Mrs. Sutherland's consent, he worked the plot
into one of his fascinating stories. It met
with a large sale, reaching its fifth edition.
The play itself, on account of Mrs. Sutherland's
illness, was not completed until 1895, and soon
afterward was produced in both the East and
the West. Its first presentation was in the
fall of 1895 at the Schiller Theatre, Chicago,
where it had a four weeks' run. In 1897 and
1898 six one-act dramas bj' Mrs. Sutherland
were put on the stage, the initial performance
of each being in Boston. The first of these,
" Po White Trash," was produced by Henrj'
Woodruff (for whom the role of Drent Dury
was written) at a special matinee at the Bijou
Theatre, Boston, and later at the Lyceum
Theatre, New York. It was also given in the
season of 1898 and 1899 by the Frawley com-
pany in the West. The other dramas are "In
Far Bohemia," "A Comedie Royal," "A Bit
of Instruction," and "At the Barricade."
These, with three plays which have not been pro-
duced, were published in book form in 1900.
They deal with varying phases of life, and some
have won marked popularity and favor. In
1900, collaborating with Mr. Booth Tarkington,
she helped to dramatize the latter's novel,
"Monsieur Beaucaire," which was brought
out by Richard Mansfield in October, 1901,
and enjoyed long and exceedingly successful
seasons in America and I']nglaiid.

Many of Mrs. Sutherland's writings have
tlealt with army life, and she has many frieniis
in both the army and the navy. She has sjient
nuich time "in garrison." At one time when
some especially dear friends were stationed at
Fort Warren, she had a den fitted up for her-
self in one of the old casemates which was used
as a prison dming the Civil War.

In s])ite of her busy life she has found time
for social affiliations, and her home on Com-
monwealth Avenue is a literary and artistic

centre. She was a charter member of the New
England's Woman's Press Club, anil has for ten
years held some office on the Executive Board.
She also belongs to the Authors' Club, the
Pentagon Club, and the Professional Woman's
League. Her pajier on "The Making of a
Critic," which has been given several times in
Boston before prominent clubs, was also given
at the Congress of Women's Clubs at the W^orld's
Fair.

In 1879 she became the wife of Dr. John P.
Sutherland, her friend from childhood, the mar-
riage taking place immediately after his gradu-
ation from the Medical School of Boston Uni-
versity. After several months' travel in Eu-
rope, Dr. Sutherland began the practice of his
profession, while she continued her literary
work. In 1888 her husband became a member
of the faculty of the Medical School of Boston
University, and since then he has been actively
connectecl with that institution, succeeding Dr.
I. Tisdale Talbot as Dean of the Medical School
in 1899. Dr. Sutherland is one of the leading
physicians of Boston, and is an ex-president
of the Massachusetts Homoeopathic Medical So-
ciety. For fourteen years he edited the Neir
England Medical Gazette.

By birth and education, ami as wife of the
Dean of Boston University Medical School,
Mrs. Sutherland holds a distinct and individual
position in Boston, while her work as playwright
and critic takes her often, and very congenially,
over the borders of Bohemia. She counts some
of her warmest frientls among the leaders in the
dramatic world. A\'here she sees talent, she is
always eager to recognize and foster it.

Her Sunday evenings are the property of
her "boys," not only of Boston University, but
of Harvard and Tech also. At her home they
find on Sunday nights a "picnic supper," a
warm welcome, and an "open parliament,"
whose leader is often the honoreil anil beloved
Dean.

Dr. and Mrs. Sutherland have two sunmier
residences, one at Nantucket, home of Mrs.
Sutherland's kinsfolk two centuries ago, and
one, "Clanshome," at Marlow, N.H., between
which homes, when not in Dr. Sutherland's na-
tive Scotland, she and her husband ilivide their
summer days.



MARY JOHNSON BAILEY LIN-
COLN, widely known as Mrs. Mary
J. Lincoln, writer and lecturer on
household science, was born in South
Attleboro, Mass., July 8, 1844. Her father,
the Rev. John Burnham Milton Bailey, pastor
of the Congregational church in that place, was
the son of William and Susannah (Burnliam)
Bailey. His mother, who ilied in 1816, was a
daughter of Deacon Samuel and Mary (Perkins)
Burnham, of Dunbarton, N.H., and sister to
the Rev. Abraham Burnham, of Pembroke.
Deacon Sanmel Burnham was a native of Essex,
Mass., formerly Chebacco parish, Ipswich, and
was of the fifth generation (Samuel,* John^^')
of that branch of the family founded by John'
Burnham, who came from England with hi.-?
brothers Robert and Thomas, and was living at
Chebacco as early as 1638.

The Rev. John B. M. Bailey died in 1851.
His wife, Sarah Morgan Johnson Bailey, Mrs.
Lhicoln's mother, born in 1810, died June 7,
1885. She was the second daughter of Deacon
Caleb and Hannah (Butler) Johnson, of Man-
chester, N.H.

Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Lincoln's maternal granil-
mother, was tlie fourth tlaughter of Jacob'' and
Sally (Morgan) Butler, of Pelham, N.H., and
a descendant of James' Butler, of Woburn,
Ma.ss., the line continuing from James' through
his son. Deacon Johm (born in Woburn, 1677,
died in Pelham, 1721); Jacob' (born in 1718),
who married Mary ICames; to Jacob* (Mrs.
Lincoln's great-grandfather), born in 1747, who
married his cousin, Sally Morgan, daughter of
Jonathan Morgan and his wife, Sarah' Butler,
sister of Jacob' Butler, Sr.

Jaines' Butler, the immigrant progenitor of
the family, came to New England less than forty
years after tiie landing of the Pilgrims, being
at Lancaster, Mass., says the historian, as
early as 1659 ami at Woburn in 1676.

"Jonathan Morgan, Sr.," above named, great-
great-grandfather of Mrs. Lincoln, "was En-
sign of Captain Dow's company, Colonel Me-
serve's regiment, which was sent to Crane's
Point in 1756. He was killed in the massacre
attending the surrender of Fort ^^'illiam Henry,
August 10, 1757."

ters of New England in that early time, Mrs.
Bailey, before her marriage, worked in the
cotton-mills of Lowell and Manchester, earning
thereby money to pay for a year of study at
Derry Academy, as a finishing tovich to the
meagre common-school education of her girl-
hoocl.

The Rev. John B. M. Bailey died when his
daughter Mary was seven years old, but the
pictui'C of his consistent life and noble character
was indelibly stamped on her memory. She
was reared by her brave and practical mother,
who early taught her three chiltlren to be use-
ful and economical. At the age of four Mary
began to add her mite to the meagre income
of a country minister's family by sewing hooks
and eyes on cards and setting stones in jewelry,
work which was given out from the factories
near by and paid for in groceries and clothing.
Throughout her girlhood she earned many new
dresses and some luxuries by picking berries,
making hair nets, and tending the neighbors'
babies. She was always made to feel that
character and education were the most desira-
ble garments for children. The self-sacrificing
mother contrived, with much plain living anti
clear thinking, to educate her daughters at
Wheaton Seminary, from which Mary was
graduated in the class of 1S64.

The following year she married Mr. David
A. Lincoln, of Norton, soon after moving to
Boston and later to Wollaston, where for sev-
eral years Mrs. Lincoln led a quiet life, devoted
to her home and innneiliate circle of friends.
Her only outside interests were her church,
with its Sunday-school, and a literary club,
which she was instrumental in organizing.

I'usine.ss reverses came, and Mrs. Lincoln,
true to the training of early life, put her hand
to the wheel, adding considerably to the in-
come by sewing and other work for her neigh-
bors. The following year, after much urging
and hesitation, she was persuaded to accept
the position of first principal of the Boston
Cooking School. By her com-teous inamier,
serene patience, executive ability, and thor-
ough mastery of her work, both mechanical
and theoretical, she brought the school at once
to a high position, the success which attended
it from the beginning being due in a great



measure to her systematic and practical method
of teaching, (^ne of the first managers of the
school said recently, "Mrs. Lincoln made the
Boston Cooking School." She is often intro-
duced as "not only the first jjrincipal, but the
first principle of the school," and "the woman
we all cook by," and so forth. After six years
of faithful ami arduous service she resigned her
position, on account of the sudden death of
her sister and the serious illness of her mother,
who died five months later.

A year before leaving the school she wrote
the "Boston Cook-book," which added greatly
to her reputation, and was at once pronounced
" one of the most practical and reliable cook-
books ever written." It has had a large cir-
culation among housekeepers, and is used as
a text-book in many of the leading schools,
not only in America, but in l']ngland, Constan-
tinople, anil among the missionaries of China.

Since leaving the confining care of the school,
Mrs. Lincoln has been heard as a lecturer in
more than two hundred different towns and
cities, from Maine to California. She has given
over seven hundred special lectures on cookery
and domestic science, always l)y invitation, in
addition to teaching the first class in the B(js-
ton Normal School of Cookery and teaching
three years at La.sell Seminaiy. She has also
written several new books and a score or more
of pamphlet recipe books for food manufacturers,
besides many articles for magazines and house-
hold papers, always by special request.

Her best known books are her " Boston
Cook-book," "Carving and Serving," "The
Peerless Cook-book," and the "Boston School
Kitchen Text-book." The latter was the first
complete book for use in the public school
cooking classes. From the second month of
its issue Mrs. Lincoln has been culinar)' editor
and one of the owners of the American Kitchen
Magazine. Since October, ISflS, she has
written weekly articles for a syndicate, which
are jiublished in daily and weekly papers all
over the country.

Over one hundred thousand copies of the
"Boston Cook-book" have been sold, and it is
still in great demand, having been revised in
1900, with the addition of about three hundred
new recipes. Doubtless, many housekeepers

will echo the sentiment of the cook who, after
repeated failures from following the directions
in other books, exclaimed, " No, Mrs. T., the
pudding was no good. I tell .you, we can't do
any better than to stick to old Mary Jane."

Mrs. Lincoln's latest printed volume is "A
Cook-book for a Month at a Time," and her
latest business venture is the manufacture of
a pure cream of tartar baking jiowder, bearing
her name, which is meeting with a ready sale.

The following is quotecl from one of many
press notices of Mrs. Lincoln: "Her personal
magnetism, her naturalness, her enthusiasm
and enjoyment in her work, win her many
friends and pupils wherever she lectures. While
instructing, in language as clear and explicit
as if her audiences were children, she never
forgets that her hearers are ladies, and she an-
swers the most absurd questions with unfailing
patience and respect. She confines her talk
to the subject at hand, and does not try to fill
up every moment of the time l)y talking just
for effect or to create a sensational discussion."-

Mrs. Lincoln is the only living rlescendant of
her father's branch of the Burnham family.
She has no children. After the death of her
husband, in 1894, she established herself in
Boston, where in a sunny study, surrounded
by her books and an interesting collection of
pictures and souvenirs of a recent summer in
Europe, she sends forth her weekly words of
culinary and household wisdom, gathered from
a varied practical experience, to help her sister
housekeepers.

Mrs. Lincoln says that she "cannot be a
business woman and a society woman at the
same time." She prefers an active, u.seful life,
and believes that success lies in tloing one thing
well. She is a member of the New England
Women's Press A.ssociation, the Wheaton Semi-
nary Club, the Charity Club, and the Cooking
Teachers' League. Her greatest enjoyment is
with her chosen circle of intimate friends, who
often share the rest and quiet of her hospitable
home.

An invitation from the publishers of the
Scientific American, New York, to write the
signed article on "Cookery" for their new En-
cyclopedia Americana, is one of Mrs. Lincoln's
latest honors.



ARY ANNE GREENE, LL.B.,
daughter of John Waterman Aborn



_|_ Y JL and Mary Frances (Low) Greene
was born in Warwick, R.I., June 14,
1857. She was grailuated from the Law School
of Boston University in 1888 with the degree
of Bachelor of Laws, magna cum laude, and
was admitted to the bar in Boston the same
year. She was the third woman graduated
from the school and the second to be admitted
to the Massachusetts bar. After practising
two years in Boston, she returned to Rhode
Lslantl in 1890, and has resided in Providence
ever since. She has an office practice, giving
her attention largely to conveyancing and the
care of estates.

Miss Greene is of the ninth generation of the
Rhode Island family founded by Dr. John
Greene, son of Richard Greene, of Bowridge
Hill, Gillingham, Dorsetshire, England. John
Greene came to Salem from Salisbury, Eng-
land, 1635, was one of the original proprietors
of Providence, 1636, and one of the original
purchasers and founders of the town of War-
wick, 1642. This family gave to the colony
and State a number of public officials, among
them a Deputy Governor, John Greene, Jr.; a
Chief Justice, who sat on the bench of the Court
of Common Pleas of Kent County all through
the Revolution; Philip Greene, an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island;
two colonial Governors, William and William,
Jr.; and two Revolutionary officers of distinc-
tion, General Nathanael Greene and Colonel
Christopher Greene.

Miss Greene's line of descent is as follows:
John' Greene, surgeon; John^ Greene, Jr., gen-
eral recorder, Attorney-General, Major for the
Main, Deputy Governor; Job' Greene, Speaker
of the House of Deputies, 1727-28; Philip'
Greene, a Justice of the Court of Common
Pleas of Kent County twenty-five years, 1759-
84, and its Chief Justice 1776-84, also As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court 1768-69;
Christopher^ Greene, Colonel-Commandant of
the Rhode Island Brigade, Continental Line,
of the Revolution; Colonel Job" Greene, of the
State Brigade in the Revolution and an origi-
nal member of the Rhode Island Society of
the Cincinnati; Simon Henry' Greene, for many

years Senator from Warwick in the Rhode
Island General Assembly; Jolin AVaternian
Aborn' Greene, who died young, but had al-
ready held many offices in the gift of the town
of Warwick. Miss Greene is his only living
child. She is also descended from Colonel
Christopher Greene and from his only brother.
Judge William^ Greene, through her mother,
Mary Frances Low, and her mother's mother,
Mary Ann' Greene (Jeremiah," William,^ Philip,"
Job,' John,^ John'), who was born in the an-
cestral home, "Occupasuatuxet," Warwick,
R.L This Mary Ann Greene, the grandmother,
for whom Miss Greene was named, contributed
stories and poems to the Providence Journal
at the age of fourteen. She was of double
Greene descent, her mother being Colonel
Christopher's grand-daughter. She married Jo-
seph Holden Low, of the Warwick branch of
the Low family, and died at twenty-one, leav-
ing an infant daughter, Mary Frances, who
became Mrs. John W. A. Greene, a woman of
fine mind. Miss Greene's mother.

Miss Greene is descended from Roger Will-
iams through the marriage of his grand-daugh-
ter, Phebe Sayles, with Major Job" Greene, and
also through her paternal grandmother, Caro-
line Cornelia Aborn. Indeed, she is descended
from nearly every one of the foimders of the
colonies of Providence and of Warwick and
from most of them in several lines, owing to
constant intermarriages.

Mrs. Julia Ward Howe is descended from
Deborah* (married Simon Ray), sister of Chief
Justice Philip" Greene and daughter of Job' and
Phebe (Sayles) Greene.

It is a notable fact that in every generation
in Miss Greene's line of the Greenes there has
been either a Senator or a Representative from
the town of Warwick in the General Assembly,
her cousin, Francis Whittier Greene, serv-
ing at the present time as Senator from War-
wick.

Miss Greene was the first American woman
invited to address the World's Congress of Juris-
prudence and Law Reform, an honor extended
to but two American and two foreign women
lawyers, their names appearing upon the same
programme with eminent American and Euro-
pean male jurists. Miss Greene assisted in



preparing the fifth edition of Schouler on the
Domestic Relations, the standard authority
in the courts upon that branch of law. She
is the only lawyer who makes a specialty of
the delivery of lectures upon practical business
law before women's clubs and girls' schools,
and she finds great interest in the subject among
all classes of women, from shop-girls and work-
ing-women to the wives of millionaires.

Miss Greene was conmiissioned by the Gov-
ernor of Rhode Island chairman of the Rhode
Island Committee on a Colonial Exhibit at
the Atlanta Exposition; and the Legislature,
upon her sole petition as chairman, appropri-
ated one thousand dollars for the colonial ex-
hibit. This is said to be the first time in his-
tory that State funds have been placed in the
control of a commission composed exclusively
of women, by a direct grant to them from the
Legislature itself.

In 1902 Miss Greene published "The Wom-
an's Manual of Law," a clear, simple, and non-
technical book of reference for women who de-
sire to inform themselves as to the laws of busi-
ness and of the domestic relations. It is said
to be the most satisfactory work of the kind
yet published. The Chicago Legal News of
iSTovember 8, 1902, says of it: —

"This book is the result of years of experi-
ence of Miss Greene, a member of the Boston
bar, as lecturer upon the subject of which it
treats. . . . The entire cycle of a woman's life,
from her marriage to the grave, is passed in
review in successive chapters. First, the laws
affecting the domestic relations are considered.
Then folloAV those dealing with buying and
selling and the care of all kinds of property.
In every case the particular legal restrictions
upon the powers of the woman who is married
are considered. Lastly, the proper disposi-
tion of property by will and by the laws of
inheritance is treated, inckuUng the rights of
the widow or the widower in the property of
either.

"Miss Greene has shown good judgment,
not only in the .selection of her subjects treated,
but in her manner of treating them. Her style
is ))Ieasing and easily understood. Every
woman who can read the English language,
and wishes to know her legal rights, should

have this manual of Miss Greene's for a com-
panion. The gifted author tells us, while all
the laws discussed in this volume are of equal
importance to men, it is entitled 'The Wom-
an's Manual of Law' because it is a selection
of laws that women especially need to know."

Since 1898 Miss Greene has been a vice-
president of the Woman's Baptist Foreign
Missionary Society. This organization includes
the New England and Middle States, also Dela-
ware and the District of Columbia. It is in-
corporated under the laws of Massachusetts,
and has its ofhce in Tremont Temple, Boston.
It is auxiliary to the American Baptist Mis-
sionary Union, ami maintains over four hun-
dred schools, with about sixteen thou.sand
jiupils in Burma, South hulia, China, Japan,
and Africa. It supports seventy-three lady
missionaries, and carries on medical work, as
well as evangelistic and etlucational. In
January, 1902, she was, by formal vote of the
Board of Directors, matle its authorized legal
adviser. Since 1895 she has been president
of the Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary
Society of Rhoile Island, a State branch of the
general society.

In 1892, at the request of the Board of Man-
agers of the Columbian Kx|)osition, she com-
piled a pamphlet entitled " Legal Status of
Women under the Laws of Rhode Island,
1892." It was originally publishetl in the
Rhode Island Woman's Directory for the Co-
lumbian Year, edited by Charlotte Field Dailey,
and published in Providence in 1893 by the
Rhode Island Woman's World's Fair Advisory
Board, of which Miss Greene was a member.
In 1900, the laws having been very much al-
tered and amended, she revised the pamphlet,
and it was published by the Rhode Island State
Federation of Women's Clubs under the title,
"Legal Status of Women in Rhode Islanil,
1900," with a preface concerning the recent
sweeping legislation for the benefit of Rhode
Island wives.

Miss Greene was the first woman contributor
to the American Laic Revieiv. Some of the
published articles are: "Privileged Communi-
cations in Suits between Hu.sband and Wife,"
American Law ^ Review, September-October,
1890; "The Evolution of the American Fee



Simple," American Law Review, March-April,
1897: "Results of the Woman Suffrage Move-
ment," Forum, June, 1894; and a series of arti-
cles on law for women in the Chautauquan, No-
vember, 1891-August, 1892.

Her translation entitled "The Woman Law-
yer," from the French of Dr. Louis Frank, the
famous Belgian champion of woman's rights
("La Fenime-Avocat," par L. Frank, Bruxelles,
1888), appeareil serially in the Chicago Law
Times for the year 1889. Dr. Frank dedicated
to Miss Greene his Catechisme de la Femme
in 1895. This little work was translated into
nearly every language of Continental Europe,
with its dedication.

Miss Greene's address at the World's Con-
gress of Jiu'isprudence upon "Married Wom-
an's Projjerty Acts' in the LTnited States, and
Needetl Reforms therein," was published in
the Chicago Legal A'cu's of August 12, 1893.
Her address delivered in the Woman's Build-
ing of the Columbian Exposition, entitled
"Legal Condition of Women in 1492 and 1892,"
is printed in full in the official volumes of the
Congresses in the Woman's Building. In the
New Englnnd Magazine for 1898 is her illu.s-
trateil article on General Nathanael Greene,
a brief biography tracing the development of
General Cireene's character ami attempting to
show what it was that made him a great mili-
tary genius.

The Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary
Society has published two small pamphlets
from her pen— "The Primer of Missions" in
1896 and "Women's Missionary Wills and
Bonds" in 1902. Miss Greene says, "If I get
interested in any subject, legal, patriotic, or
missionary, I have to deliver addresses and
publish articles about it." She is a magnetic
speaker, anil has the power to hold her audi-
ences and to inspire them with enthusiasm.

At the Fortieth Anniversary of the first
Woman's Rights Convention she repre.sented
women in the legal profession. The meeting,
presided over by Lucy Stone, was held in Trem-
ont Temple, January 27, 1891, and Miss Greene,
though her voice is naturally low, as she spoke
on "Women in the Law," made three thousand
people hear with ease.

.As a presiding officer she is unusually popu-

lar and successful. In her own words, "I suj)-
pose it is because I have such complete self-
possession myself that my audience feel easy
and comfortable themselves." She was State
Regent for Rhode Island of the Daughters of
the American Revolution from 1895 to 1897,
and is now an Honorary State Regent.

Miss Greene says: "I did not intend to delay
for so many years my application for admis-
sion to the bar of Rhode Island. No woman
has yet applied here. By the rules of court
a member of the bar of another State may
appear here and plead, but all court papers
must be signed by a member of the Rhode
Island bar. As I do not practise in court,
there has been no need for me to apply, and I
have put it off from time to time for a more
convenient season. I am not an 'agitator'
of any sort, and do not care to do anything
merely for the sake of the notoriety of doing
it. I am glad to help where I can to make the
world better by informing the people of pres-
ent conditions, pointing out reforms, and help-
ing others to do the reforming if I can."



MARY DANA HICKS PRANG, art
educator, residing in Boston, was
born in Syracuse, N.Y., October 7,
1836, daughter of Major and Agnes A.
(Johnson) Dana. The Dana family to which
she belongs has a record in New England of over
two hundred and fifty years, its immigrant
progenitor, Richard Dana, having come to this
country in 1640, and settled in Cambridge,
Mass. From RichanP the line continued
through Daniel,^ Thomas,^ Daniel,^ Daniel,'* to
Major Dana, above mentioned, who was of the
sixth generation, Mrs. Prang being of the
seventh. Mrs. Prang's father was a prosperous
merchant, a man of sterling character, who
supported every forward movement. Among
his remarkable qualities were a memory that
never failed and an usual appreciation of beauty
of effect, of fine design, and of harmony of color.
Her mother, who was a brilliant woman, a poet
and artist, was a leader in the literary society
of Syracuse. Benevolent enterprises received
her encouragement, and she was an inspiration
to all who had the pleasure of her acquaint-



ance. She lived to the advanced age of ninety-
four years.

Mary Dana was an observant little girl, and
at the age of two years had learned her letters
from large handbills. For some time she was
a ]3upil in a private school close by her home.
Throughout her school life she was found equal
to children three or four years older.

She was graduated from the Allen Seminary,
Rochester, N.Y., in 1852, after a course of study
in mathematics, the languages, and history,
with general study of the sciences; and later
she pursued special studies at Harvard and at
the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

On her twentieth birthday she became the
wife of Charles Spencer Hicks, a promising*
young lawyer of Syracuse. In less than two
years her husband was drowned. On April 15,
1900, she married Louis Prang, of Boston, the
distinguished art publisher.

Owing to financial reverses in 1858, she re-
ceived private pupils, the greater number being
in drawing. Her work with these pupils led
her to a deep consideration of the influence
of art instruction on education. Drawing
was conniionly regarded as an end to be attained
only by the specially gifted. Close study and
wide observation confirmed her in the belief
that drawing should be a study not for the few
only, but for all, a means of expression for every
child, and therefore should be an integral part
of public school education.

Receiving the ap})ointment of supervisor of
drawing in the public schools of Syracuse, she
visited several of the larger cities in the country,
to observe school conditions. She found that
drawing had a place in neaily every course of
study, but that there was actually very little
work of merit accomplished. More favorable
conditions existed in Boston than elsewhere,
l)ut even in that city drawing was not given
the prominence to which she believed it justly
entitleil. Strengthened in her judgment re-
specting the value of art-teaching in the public
schools, she continued her work in Syracuse
with increased enthusiasm.

About this time AV alter Smith was called to
Massachusetts to become the head of art educa-
tion in the State. He established the Normal
School in Boston, and gave considerable im-

petus to the study of art. Mrs. Prang visited
him in Boston, and, introducing his l)ooks in
Syracuse, found them of great service in mak-
ing possible the study of historic ornament,
supplying in some measure the examples neces-
sary for her work.

Mrs. Prang's remarkable physique and ex-
cellent health enabled her to complete success-
fully an unusual amount of labor. Several
of her classes in the high scliool numbered
seventy or eighty pupils each, but Mrs. Prang
worked with the strength of her convictions,
and with a joyousness of spirit that communi-
cated itself to her pupils.

In order that the children might be properly
taught, she formed teachers' classes that were
conducted after school hours. In atUlition
she closely supervised the work in all the
schools, and was ever ready to help the teachers
with pertinent suggestions and cheerful en-
couragement. Her supervision of the schools
of Syracuse extendeil over more than ten years:
and there are teachers in the field to-day,
occupying high positions, who are proud to
trace the beginning of their successes to the
influence of Mrs. Prang, with whom they were
associated as high school students or as grade
teachers.

Exhibitions of public school drawings were
held at the high school building, anil, while
children and teachers were thus encouraged
and stimulated, the general public became
educated as to the possibilities of children in
this direction. The.se exhibitions, together
with exhibitions made at the State Teachers'
Association and at the Centennial Exposition
in Philadelphia in 1876, were all factors in the
progress of art education in the public schools.

In Syracuse they attracted the attention of
broud-mimled people, and comprehensive re-
ports upon them were made by physicians, ar-
chitects, and other jieopie of education, among
whom were Dr. Martin B. Anderson, President
of Rochester University, and Dr. Andrew D.
AVhite, President of Cornell University. The
public schools of Syracuse became well known
as foremost in the country in art education.

Entleavoring in every way to spread the
influence of art, Mrs. Prang assisteil largel}'
in the development of the Social Art Club of



Syracuse, the purpose of which was the read-
ing of the history of art and the study of his-
toric antl current art. Mrs. Prang was president
of the club for five j'ears, and through her ef-
forts its members were able to gather illus-
trations and to pursue a systematic course of
reading relating to ancient, early Christian,
and modern art. The club was extremely
popular, the wailhig list being filled with
names of women of the highest social standing.
The present president, formerly a student with
Mrs. Prang, has held the position for twenty-
five years. The Social Art Club was the second
club formed in Syracuse, being antedated only
by the Portfolio Club, an association of Mrs.
Prang's pupils.

From the beginning of Mrs. Prang's con-
nection with the Prang Educational Company
in 1878, she was adviser on all the educational
phases of the work. Even before her name
appeared as joint author of the various publi-
cations jjrepareil by the company, all ques-
tions involving educational influence and value
were lirought to her for judgment and advice.
Her wide experience antl sympathetic insight
as to the needs of the teachers contributed
largely toward making possible the wide intro-
duction of the Prang work in the public schools
of the country. Her wisdom and catholicity
helped to make the Prang work acceptable to
the utilitarian, to the lover of beauty in form
anil color, and to the educator. The spirit
of the work in its power of developing and u\)-
1 if ting was never forgotten.

Mrs. Prang was among the first to point out
that the instruction in art given in the public
schools must of necessity cover entirely dif-
ferent ground from that given in the art schools
and studios. She taught clearly the difference
in the purpose of the two— the one being in-
tended for those specially gifted by nature,
while the other means the development of the
art instinct, the power of art expression in
every child. Advocating these views, she
is a frequent speaker at art and educational
associations. The difficulties attending the
introduction of a comi)aratively new work and
the lack of public school training on the part
of supervisors led them to seek frequent con-
ferences with Mrs. Prang, and many super-

visors submitted to her criticism oullincs for
work in their scliools before giving tlie work
to teachers and pupils. Tlie need of closer
and more systematic instruction for teachers
and supervisors becoming apjiarent, the Prang
normal art classes for home study in form,
drawing, and color, with instruction by corre-
spondence, were organized in 1SS7. They
were designed to assist pulilic school teachers
in preparing thcnnselves to toivch the subjects
of form, drawing, and color. The advantages
of these classes were cfuickly seized upon by
hundreds of teachers in all grades, by jirinci-
pals of schools, and by supervisors.

Much of the beneficent and far-reaching
influence of this movement is unquestionably
due to the personality of Mrs. Prang as director.
Her beautiful spirit made itself distinctly felt
even through the cold medimn of dictated
letters and typewritten correspondence. Her
cheerful greeting to the new student, perhai)s
in Maine, perhaps in C'alifornia, established
from the first a sense of welcome and an as-
surance of sympathy.

This instruction by correspondence came
like a ray of light in the darkness to many a
discouraged, conscientious teacher, struggling
in her own out-of-the-way little corner with
the great problems of education.' For to Mrs.
Prang, and to those who shared her faith and
her enthusiasm, art education in the public
schools meant the uplifting of all the studies
to a higher plane. In all her teachings the
thought was to lead beyond the actual thing
taught to its relation to nature and to human
life. Those who were fortunate enough to
become students with Mrs. Prang will look
back upon the association with a deep sense
of pleasure and gratitude.

As Mrs. Prang, from her first decision in ISfiS
to make public art education her lih^-work,
strenuously devoted herself to its promotion,
her work as an author has been largely in that
direction. She was joint author with John S.
Clark of "The Use of Models" (1886); with
John S. Clark and Walter Scott Perry of " The
Prang Shorter Course in Form Study and Draw-
ing," "Form Study without Clay," "The
Prang Complete Course in I'Virm Study and
Drawing," "The Prang Elementary Course in



Art Instruction"; ;ind with John S. Clark and
Louis Prang of " Suggestions, for Color Instruc-
tion" (1893). Her latest work is "Art In-
struction for Children in Primary Schools,"
in two volumes (1800).

In the intervals of this very busy life Mrs.
Prang has found time to share in other work
for the jx'ojjle. She was one of the charter
members of the Massachusetts Floral Emlilem
Society, wiiich was organized July 4, 1804,
by Mrs. Ellen A. Richardson, at Winthrop,
Mass. One object of the society is to bring
about a more rational celebration of the Fourth
of July, and to that end the society endeavors
to cultivate a love for the beautiful in the
minds of school children by the distribution
of flowers on that day. Mrs. Prang was presi-
dent of the society in 1898 and 1900, and she
inaugurated the public distribvition of flowers
to the childnMi of Boston, in 1S98 flowers being
given to twentv-five hundred children and in
1000 to nearly four thousand. In March, 1000,
and again in February, 1901, Mrs. Prang ap-
]iearetl before the Legislative committee to
advocate the adoption of a floral emblem for
the State of Massachusetts.

Mrs. Prang is a meml)er of the Wintergreen
Club, the New England Women's Club, the
lv[ual Suffrage Society for Good Government,
the Twentieth Century Club, Woman's I'ldu-
cational and Industrial Union, the Boston
lousiness Leagvic, the Womnn's Alliance, the

AUGUSTA HALE GIFFORD, histori-
cal writei', wa? born in Turner, Andros-
L coggin County, Me., and brought up
through girlhood on one of the old
Maine farms. Her father and mother, James
Sullivan Hale and his wife, Betsej' Staples, had
settled on the family estate, which had been
redeemed from the rocks and briers by Mrs.
Clifford's grandparents, David Hale and his
wife, Sally Kingsbury, in the early years of the
nineteenth century.

David Hale, Mrs. Clifford's paternal grand-
father, was a native of Harvanl, Mass., horn
in 1772, and a lineal descendant in the sixth
generation of Thomas' Hale, the immigrant
progenitor of this branch of the Hale family
in New England, who settled at Newbury, Mas-
sachusetts Bay Colony, about 1637. Davitl
Hale married Sally Kingsbury, of Ellington,
Conn., daughter of Simon Kingsbury, and liveil
in Rutland, Mass , until their removal to Turner,
Oxford County, Me., in 1802. They made the
voyage of three weeks from Boston to Fal-
mouth (Portland) in the winter sea^son, in a
sailing-vessel, and were obliged to leave their
two chililren in Falmouth until sunuuer, since
it was not practicable earlier to take them forty
miles through the woods.

The Kingsburys were a remarkable family
intellectually, and Sally Kingsbury Hale brought
to these wilds a well-developed and well-stored
mind. Although living to be an octogenarian,
she still retained her excellent memory ; and to
the delight of her grandchildren, the eUler chil-
dren of her son Sullivan, she whiled away the
long winter evenings, passed before the huge
open fireplace, witii vivid accounts of battles of
the Revolution, including that of Monmouth, in
which her brother, Dr. Joseph Kingsbury, was
wounded, and with thrilling stories of Indian
captivities and other adventures in far-off
colonial times. These stories she told as she
had heard them in her girlhood from the lips
of Ephraim Kingsbury, of Haverhill—" Uncle
Ephraim," she used to call him— stories partly



of his own experience and partly, perhaps, relat-
ing to the Ephraim Kingsbury who is on record
in Chase's History of Haverhill, Mass., as hav-
ing been killed by Indians in 1676.

Sullivan and Betsey (Staples) Hale were the
parents of five children, namely: Eugene,
I'nited States Senator; Hortense, who with
her husband. Dr. Gushing, a retired physician,
now lives on the old homestead in Turner, Me.;
Frederick (deceased); Augusta (Mrs. Clifford);
and Clarence, of Portland, Me., Judge of the
United States Court.

Augusta Hale was fitted for college in the
high school of Turner, in the companionship
of a beloved brother, Frederick, with whom
she shared every sport, overcame every diffi-
culty, antl was permitted to accomplish every
task. They even studied their lessons from the
same book, going to ami from school together.
His death in 1868 was her first affliction, and
it marked the beginning of her literary aspira-
tion. In 1859, at the age of seventeen, she
entered Oberlin, then almost the only fully
e(iuip])ed college (with a complete classical
curriculum) in the country open to both sexes.
Her voice was often heard in the college and
the college society parts, delivered in the large
clun-ch then, as now, connecteil therewith.
But her stutlent life at Oberlin was only the
beginning of the self-culture which must nec-
essarily supjjlement the early education of men
and women who accomplish anything worth
while for the world.

After graduation she settled in Portland,
and in 1869 was married to the Hon. George
Gifford, originally a lawyer, afterward a jour-
nalist, and finally for n^any years as at present
in the consular service. Mrs. Gifford shared with
her husband different fields «f foreign labor, and
this resilience abroad has continued for her
somewhat intermittently for more than a quar-
ter of a century, their home being at intervals
in London, Paris, various parts of France, and
for several years in Basle, Switzerland. She
became the mother of three children— Kath-
erine, Clarence Hale, and Marguerite. The
younger daughter was born during a long resi-
lience of the family in Nantes, France. Many
interesting and anuising incidents occurred
in Mrs. Clifford's eariy trips across the Atlantic

with her little ones, at a time when the voyage
in stormy weather sometimes extended over
a spaee of fifteen or sixteen days, and the perils
and hardships of the ocean had not been ameli-
orated to the extent which obtains at present.

lu her early life abroad Mrs. Gifford imbibed
a taste for foreign literature, foreign languages,
and foreign travel, which sha])ed her subse-
quent career. She has since travelled exten-
tively over Europe and the Orient, many of
the countries visited having been but recently
made accessible to the traveller. Her plans
and tours have been all marked out in advance,
and her research has been so thorough that the
maj) of Europe to her is like an illuminated
book, even the unaccustomed routes being like
the beaten track in her own garden. She has
delighted the public with a large foreign cor-
respondence, her vivitl imagination making
the scenes of these various countries and the
customs and habits of the jieople stand out
before her readers like familiar experiences, her
interesting and practical relations furnishing
much valuable information to other travellers.

Since 18. 3, after the death of her eldest child,
Katherine, born in 1870, a young lady of lovely
character, Mrs. Gifford has found great solace in
literature. In her first travels through Germany,
fascinated bvGerman life and the people, she con-
ceived the idea of putting into form a racy ac-
count of the Germans from their beginning;
and from this idea was developed the series
of books, beginning with "Germany: Her People
and Their Story," published by the Lothrop
Publishing Company in 1899. It is as readable
as a romance, one of its great merits being tliat
its historical facts have an attractive setting.
Evidently prepared with reference to the re-
quirements of the general reader, it is something
more than an outline of the salient features in
the progress of the German nation from bai-
barism to enligiitenment, from a confederacy
of loosely allied states to a strongly cemented
empire. Legend and anecdote have been skil-
fully woven into the story, and vivid glim])ses
are given of the national life, and a clear insight
into the national character. It was a difficult
task the author had before her of condensing
within the limits of a six-hundred-page vol-
ume twelve hundred years of a nation's growth.



There was danger on the one hand of making
the volume little more than a chronological
record, ami on the other of inadequacy. The
success with which she has avoided both dan-
gers attests a fine sense of proportion, discrimi-
nating judgment, and much literary skill.

"Mrs. Gifford's 'Germany' was received with
so much favor by both the people and her pub-
lishers that she was encouraged to go on with
the series. She has now for several years been
collecting material abroad for her 'Italy,' vis-
iting tliat country many times in order to ab-
sorb all the phases of Italian life and character;
and 'Italy: Her People and their Story,' bids
fair even to excel the first of the series in in-
terest."

Mrs. Gifford has also given much time to
club work, writing many i)apers and giving
many lectures and talks. Her papers on "Ger-
man Literature and German Authors," "Mis-
sion Work in India" (the origin of the people
from the Aryans, their early religious develop-
ment, etc.), an article entitled "How to Travel,"
and her very celebrated lecture, " From the
North Cape to the Orient," have attracted
nmch attention. Her series of talks on archi-
tecture, condensed for students and travellers,
is to be the nucleus of a volume entitled " The
Architecture of Cathedrals and Castles, for
Students and Travellers," when time shall per-
mit her to complete the work.

Mrs. Gifford through all those years of travel
has retained her home in I'ortland, Me., and
when in America it has always been hei- pleas-
ure to spend her time in this beautiful little
city by the sea and again get in touch with real
New England life. Both at home and abroad
her society is sought by jieople of culture, and
she is a welcome presence in any gathering.



KATE E. GRISWOLD, proprietor and
publisher of Profitalde Advertising, a
monthly magazine issued in Boston,
devoted to the interests of advertisers
and })ublishers, is widely known as a success-
ful journalist, the periodical of which she is the
sponsor ranking, it is said, as foremost of its
kind in the world. Miss Griswold was born
about thirty-five years ago at West Hartford.

Conn. Her father, John Belden Griswold, a
native of Newington, Conn., was born in 1828,
son of Josiah Wells and Mary A. (Belden)
Criswold. Her mother, whose maiden name
was Cornelia Arnold Jones, was born at East
Hartford in 1830, daughter of Joseph Pantra
Jones and his wife, Sarah Comstock.

After pursuing her studies, both elenientarj'
anil classical, at some of the best public and
private schools in Hartford, she turned natu-
rally enough to journalism, entering the office
of. the Poultry World in that city. One of the
practical Occui)alions of her girlhood at home
had been the raising of poultry, which she had
nuule financially profitai)le. Her story, as in
all cases of genuine success, is a story of liard
work and a slow climb from humble begiimings.
Her promotion to a responsible position in the
office of the National Trotting A.ssociation came
within a year, and again illustrates the special
fitness of things, for she is an enthusiastic
devotee of the horse.

At the end of her second year constant appli-
cation to an ever-increasing bvn-den of duties
had worn her out, and for a time she was obliged
to give up the struggle. Several years of re-
tirement and rest, however, brought her again
to the front with a renewed ston^ of strength.

Flattering offers were at Miss Griswold's di,«-
posal, l)ut she turned from them all to take up
the management of the organ of a local chari-
table enterprise. To The Harljord Cihj Misf&lt;ion
Record, and to the cause in general which it
representeil, she devoted herself for the next
four years. Toward the close of this period
of charitable work she entered into .several
prize competitions for advertising designs, and
was perhaps not wholly surprised at carrying
off the honors in a number of cases. The at-
tention thus attracted to the fact of a woman's
success as an "ad" writer led to an offer from
Boston.

A position as general ad writer and corre-
spondent in the office of the C. F. David Adver-
tising Agency, the original promoters of Profit-
able Advertising, soon demonstrated her fitness
for the editor's chair. In the course of a year
or two she became the propiietor as well as
the editor of the publication.

The story of Mi.ss Griswold's subsequent



career is simply the record of a shining success
obtained slowly by the exercise of thoi^e quali-
ties that alone can ensure fortune. The path
has been hard and the difficulties unusual.
Up to three years ago the editor as well as the
manager of Profitable Advertising, Miss Griswold
was especially handicapped by the very general
doubt as to the practicability of the under-
taking. When she began to edit Profitable
Advertising, the number of women who were
making a living in the advertising field could
be counted on the fingers of one hand. They
are now numbered by scores, and it is not too
nmch to say that the single example c^f Miss
Griswokl's grit and sagacity has hatl more to
do with this than any other single cause.

Profitable Advertising is a periodical which
stands for and reflects more than most publi-
cations the individuality of its owner and man-
ager. In this respect Miss Gri.swold deserves
honorable mention in the same class with such
representative American pul:)lishers as the Ben-
netts of the Her&lt;dd, Dana of the Sun, and Horace
Greeley of the Tribune. Iler publication has
within tlie past three years attained high-water
mark, and, as already intimated above, is rec-
ognized by the leading authorities of two con-
tinents as the model and standard of its class.

It is needless to add in words a personal trib-
ute to such a record. Mi.ss Griswold numbers
many friends in the publishing and advertising
fields at large. She is a young woman whose
powers have not yet touched their prime.

The ancestry of Miss Griswold has been
traced back through various lines to conspicu-
ous early colonists of her native State, she being
also a "Mayflower" descendant, a double one,
so to speak, deriving through both father and
mother from William Bratlford, Governor of
"Plymouth Plantation."

Her father, John Belden Griswold, was born
in 1828, son of Josiah W^ells and Mary Ann
(Belden) GriswoUl and a descendant in the
eighth generation of Michael' Griswold, of
Wethersfield. The line is: Michael'; Jacob,'^
born in 1660; Major Josiah,^ born in 1700;
Josiah,''1728; Solomon,^ 1751 ; Josiah,^ 1775; Jo-
siah Wells,' 1794; John Beklen,- Kate E. being
of the ninth generation.

Mr. Griswold's paternal grandmother, the



46

wife of Josiah,' was Abigail Wells, daughter of
Robert and Abigail (Hurlbut) Wells and grand-
daughter of Lieutenant Robert and Abigail
(Burnham) Wells, the Wells ancestry beginning
^\ith Thomas AVells (or Welles), one of the origi-
nal proprietors of Hartford and Wethersfield,
many years a magistrate and for two years CJov-
ernor of the colony. Mrs. Al)igail Burnham
Wells was a daughter of the Rev. William
Burnham (William,' Thomns') and his wife
Haimah, daughter of Samuel' \\'olcott, of Wind-
sor. SamueP was grandson of I-Ienry' Wolcott,
the founder of the distinguished family of this
surname, prolific of governors.

Mary A. Belden, wife of Josiah Wells (Jris-
wold and grandmother of Kate E., was a daugh-
ter of John and Asenath (Darrow) Belden and
grand-daughter of John Kellogg Belden and
his wife Mercy, who was sister to Noah Webster,
the le.xicographer.

Bradford descent through the Websters is
thus shown: Governor William' Bradford mar-
ried for his second wife Mrs. Alice Carpenter
Southworth. Their son AVilliam^ married, first,
Alice Richards. Mercy^ Bradford, born of
this union, married Sanuiel Steele in 1680, and
resided in Hartfortl. Their son, Eli])halet''
Steele, married Catherine Marshfield, and was
the father of Mercy'' Steele, born at West Hart-
ford in 1727, who married Noah W'ebsler, Sr.,
the couple last named being the parents of
Mercy," born at West Hartford in 1749, and of
her younger brother, Noah Webster, of dic-
tionary fame.

Mercy W^ebster was of the sixth generation
of the family founded by John' Webster, one
of the original proprietors of Hartford, Conn.,
and two j'ears Governor. The line from John'
Webster was continued through Robert," John, '^
Daniel,"* to Noah," born 1722, who married
Mercy Steele, as noted above.

Miss Griswold's maternal grandparents were
Jo.seph Pantra and Sarah (Comstock) Jones,
the grandfather, born in 1785, son of John and
Elizabeth (Williams) Jones and great-giandson
of Nathaniel Jones ami his wife, Reliekah
Bantra, who was a descendant of William'
Pantra, of Hartford. Elizalieth Williams was
a daughter of Timothy'* Williams, great-gratid-
son of William' Williams, of Hartford. Her



mother, whose maiden name was Ruth Pitkin,
was the daughter of Ozias Pitkin and grand-
daughter of William' Pitkin, founder of the
prominent Hartford family of this surname,
and brother of Martha Pitkin, who married
Simon AVolcott, and was the mother of the
first Roger Wolcott in New England. Another
ancestor belonging to one of the first families
of Hartford was Ozias' Goodwin, whose daugh-
ter Hannah was the wife of William Pitkin and
mother of Ozias Pitkin.

Mrs. S.arah Comstock Jones was a daughter
of Perez and Abigail N. (Raymond) Comstock
anil grand-daughter of Nathaniel''' Comstock
and his wife, vSarnh Bradford, born in [he North
Parish of New Ijondon (now Montville) in
1744, who was of the fifth generation of Plym-
outh Colony stock. The line was: Governor
William' Bradford; William^ anti his .second
wife, widow Wiswall; .foseph' and his second
wife, Mary, widow of Captain Daniel Fitch;
John* and wife, Esther Sherwood; Sarah.^

Abigail, wife of Perez Comstock and mother
of Sarah, was a daughter of Dr. Christojjher'*
Raymond (Joshua, * ''' ^ Richard') and his wife
Eleanor. The tatter was a daugliter of Daniel'
P'itch and great-granddaughter of the Rev.
James Pitch, of Saybrook and Norwich, Conn.
Her grandfather. Captain Daniel'* Fitch, was
.«on of the Rev. James by his .&lt;econd wife,
Priscilla, therefore a grandson of the latter's
father, Major John M.a.son, sometimes styled the
" Myies Standish of the Coimecticut Colony."

Joshua'* Raymond, son of Joshua,' married
Elizabeth Christophers, and was the father of
Dr. Christopher Raymond, born in 1729.

Literary Unicjn of Portland (organized in 1889),

she was quick to foresee the benefits which a
State organization would confer upon clTib
women in Maine, the State whose motto is
"Dirigo." She it was who invited representa-
tive club women to meet in her parlors to con-
sult in regard to the advisability of such a step.
Three months later, September 23, 1892, the
first State federation was formed, with nine-
teen clubs as charter members and Mrs. Fvyc
its secretary. Other States soon followed this
example, and the result has been most happj\

Mrs. Croly (Jennie June) said of Mrs. Frye,
"She is the Alma Mater of clubs and club
women of Maine, a woman of large heart and
broad intelligence, who works toward the best
end without any shadow of pettiness or self-
seeking." As the press notices and reports of
various literary and philanthropic movements
in Portland testify to occasions when prelimi-'
nary meetings were held in Mrs. Frye's parlors,
so the subsecjuent accounts invariably tell of
wise plans faithfully carried out for the general
good. Mrs. Frye has a genius for organizing,
working with indomit;d)l(&gt; energy and anima-
tion for present and future good.

Mrs. Frye was the first president of the Board
of Directors of the Mary Brown Home, a highly
useful institution founded on broad princi|)les.
This is a resting-place for sick and broken-
down women, who have always been indus-
trious, self-supi)orting, and self-respecting. It
is unique in having, beside the regular directors,
an advisory board of men and women, as well
as a co-operative board of helpers from busi-
ness houses where women are employed. This
plan for an invalids' home was originated by
a little band of Methodist women. Some mem-
bers of the Universalist church next became
interested, and finally all the churches took
hold of the work. Mary Cobb was the pioneer
worker, and Mrs. Brown (for whom the home
is rfow called) made a practical begimiing pos-
sible in the summer of 1894 by giving the use
of her cottage at Trefethern's Landing. Later
a cottage was purchased at 28 Revere Street,
Portland. There was soon a demand for more
than its twelve rooms, and a new and larger
building has been built on the site of thr ancient
Bradley Meeting-hou.se, a site which was a gift
to the directors for that purpose. During the



nine years over a hundred invalids and broken-
down women had shelter and care, and all
but seven of this number have been restored
to health and have gone back to their work.
The labor, the tact, the time and strength,
to say nothing of the open purse which Mrs.
Frye has had ready as the occasion has de-
manded in this particular service, show how
nmch it has been a labor of love. How truly she
is a philanthropist! One is not surprised to
learn that she comes of strong Quaker stock.
Mrs. Frye was born at Vassalborough, Me.,
January 8, 1852, being the daughter of Caleb
and Maria Nichols. Her father and mother
were elders in the Vassalborough Society
of Friends, and for years clerks of the
business meetings. Always working in the
interests of progress in the town, they were
trustees from its organization of Oak Grove
Seminary, a l''riends' school at Vassalborough.
Their daughter Eunice was mostly eilucated in
that seminary, being a student there for years.
She was for some time the principal of the Uni-
tarian Friends' School at Orchard Park, N.Y.,
now a normal school. In her girlhood she spent
several winters with her brother. Dr. Charles
H. Nichols, superintendent of the Government
Hospital for the Insane at A^'ashington, D.C.

On June 15, ISSO, Eunice Nichols became
the wife of Mr. George C. Frye, a chemist and
importer of surgical instruments. Her home
in Portland has ever been noted for its cordial
hospitality; for her husband, like herself, is of
a genial nature, and delights in sharing his
prosperity with others.

Mrs. Frye is vice-president at large of the
National Dorothea Dix Association. Fltficient
women are always in demand, and because she
is efficient she is busy, so busy that it seems
" Her life is but a working day, whose tasks
arc set aright."



MAY ALDEN WARD, author and lect-
urer, residing in Boston, is now (1903)
serving her second year as president
of the Massachusetts Federation of
Women's Clubs. A native of Ohio, born at
Milford Centre, near Columbus, March 1, 1853,
as the daughter of Prince William and Rebecca

(Neal) Alden she rightfully inherits the tradi-
tions of the Commonwealth foiindod by the
Pilgrim Fathers and the Puritans of the Bay
Colony. The first paragraph of her family
history was penned by Governor Bradfortl
more than two hundred years ago: —

"John Alden was hired for a cooper at South-
ampton, where the ship victualed; and being a
hopeful young man, was nmch desired but left
to his own liking to go or stay when he came;
but he stayed and marrietl here."

From John' Alden and the ready-witted
Priscilla (who,se parents, William and Alice
Mullins, antl their son Joseph, died the first
winter) the line was continued through Cap-
tain Jonathan,^ Andrew,'^ Major Prince,* An-
drew Stanford/' Prince William," to May' (Mrs.
Ward).

Captain Jonathan Alden married Abigail,
daughter of Andrew Hallet, Jr.^ Andrew Al-
den, their eldest son, mai-ried Lydia Stanford.
Major Prince Alden married Mary Fitch,
daughter of Adonijah Fitch, of Montville,
Conn. Her father was a grandson of the Rev.
James' Fitch, of Saybrook and Norwich, Conn.,
and his .second wife, Priscilla Mason, daughter
of Major John Mason, famous military leader
of the Connecticut Colony.

A year or two before the begiiming of the
Revolutionary War, Major Prince Aklen mi-
grated with his family from Connecticut to
Wyoming Count}', Pennsylvania, where he be-
came a large land-owner. In bSlG Andrew
Stanford Alden, with his wife, F^lizabeth Ailing-
ton, and their children, removed from Tioga
County, New York, to Ohio.

Prince William Alden, Mrs. Ward's father, a
merchant and banker, born in 1809, ilied Feb-
ruary 27, 1893. He married in 1844 Rebecca,
daughter of Henry Neal, of Mechanicsbm-g,
Ohio, and his wife, Catherine Bigelow, who was
a daughter of Isaac Bigelow, of Dunmierston,
\'t., and a descendant of John Biglo, of Water-
town, the founder of the Bigelow family of
New luigland. Mrs. Rebecca Neal Alden, born
in 1823, died April 12, 1898. Mr. and Mrs.
Alden had three children — Hemy, Reuben,
and May (now Mrs. Ward).

From her father May Alden inherited a taste
for history and literature. She began to study



and to use her pen very early, contributing
articles to the Cincinnati Cimvvercial before
she was sixteen. She was educated at Ohio
Wesleyan l^niversity, Delaware, Ohio, and
after her gra&lt;luation in 1872 she studied some
years abroad, devoting henself to French, Ger-
man, and iMiglish literature, later taking up
Italian. On June 1, 1873, she was married to
AMlliam G. Ward, since 1898 professor of Eng-
lish literature at the Emerson College of Ora-
tory, Boston, formerly holding the same chair
at Syracuse University, Syracuse, N.Y., and
at an earlier date President of vSpokane College.
Profe.ssor Ward is the author of several books,
among them "Tennyson's Debt to Environ-
ment" and "The Poetry of Robert Browning."

Since she came to New England, twelve years
ago, the rise in club life of Mrs. May Alden
Waril has been constant and rapid. At Frank-
lin she organized a club of which she was the
first president, and which was afterward named
for her the Alden Clul). Later while living in
Cambridge she was for four years president of
Cantabrigia, one of the largest and most ener-
getic clubs of the countrj'. At the same time
Mrs. Ward became a member of the famous
New England Woman's Club, in which she is
still one of the most valued workers. For two
years she was president of the New England
Woman's Press Association, and she is strong
in its councils at the present time. She is also
a charter member and director of the Authors'
Club of Boston. She was the first vice-presi-
dent of the Ma.ssachu.setts State Federation for
two years before becoming its president. She
also has interest in various public affairs, and
has been appointed one of the Commissioners
for Massachusetts at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition in St. Louis.

Mrs. Ward began lecturing about twelve
years ago, resi)oiiding to the request of some
ladies who asked her t&lt;i give parlor talks on
French literature. As a lecturer and teacher
she now does an enormous amount of work,
her accuracy, her pleasing address, her direct-
ness, and the large amount of information
crowded into her lessons and lectures making
her one of the most popular club lecturers in
New England. Of her efforts in that field the
New York Times has this to say: "Mrs. Ward



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGT.AND

has the historian's instinct, and gives her facts
without feeling the necessity of breaking into
ejaculations over their picturesqueness. Her
good training as a writer tells, as it always
ought to tell; and her papers on subjects con-
nected with our colonial history are written in
a style both reticent and lively." Kate San-
born's comment on her lectures is both true
and adequate: "At the close of each course the
audience feels acquainted with the men and
women analyzed, and familiar with their best
achievements; for she has the power to vitalize
a subject, throwing arountl it the fascination
felt by herself — a rare gift and akin to genius."

Aside from the prestige which the advance-
ment in club circles may lend to her name,
Mrs. Ward has won a reputation as a writer
that rests on the firm foundation of merit.
Among her books are a Life of Dante, Life of
Petrarch, "Old Colony Days," and "Prophets
of the Nineteenth Century." These have re-
ceived great praise from literary critics. Her
"Dante" and "Petrarch," it is freely conceded,
each met the need of a concise life in iMiglish
never before filled. William Dean Howells
.says of the former: "While we are still upon
Italian ground, we wish to speak of Mrs. May
Alden Ward's very clear, unaffected, and inter-
esting sketch of Dante and his life and works.
The effort is something comparable to those
processes by which the stain and whitewash
of centuries is removed, anil the beauty and
truth of some noble fresco underneath is brought
to life again. Mrs. Ward has wrought in the
right spirit, and she shows a figure, simple,
conceivably like, and worthy to be Dante,
with which she has apparently not suffered
her fancy to play."

Of the "Petrarch" Mrs. Louise Chandler
Moulton says: "Mrs. Ward has done her work
admirably; and from this one book you may
glean all that is of real value in the hundreds
of volumes of which Petrarch has been the
theme. His love, his friendship, his ambi-
tions, his greatness, and his follies, . . . they
are written here."

No less an expert than John Fi.ske thus pro-
nounced upon the merits of "Old Colony Days":
"The sympathy and breadth of treatment make
it a charming series of essays." One of the



best of the appreciations of the book is that of
the Chicago Times-Herald: "Plain history in
fascinating guise is so rare a gift to the per-
functory seeker for knowledge that attention
must be called to a charming new book, 'Old
Colony Days,' written in the sprightliest of
easy styles for young or old, and displaying
the high lights of the history of the New Eng-
land colonies. It is not that the story is new:
it as old as love to Puritans and their descend-
ants. It is on account of a crisp, brisk, and
ringing style, and on account of the taste with
which the historian discriminates in subject
matter, that we like the book so well. The
half-satirical, half-serious manner in which
all our ancestral worthies are memorized is
indeed attractive. There are never too many
words, there is always a simple style, and there
are invariably points of interest lighted upon."

Mrs. Ward's latest book, "Prophets of the
Nineteenth Century," is in a sense her most
important one, and into it she has put more
of her own personality. The "Prophets," Car-
lyle, Ruskin, Tolstoi, stand for humanity. We
are sure that the expression of their convictions
in the book voices Mrs. W^ard's own feelings;
that their theories of life have largely influ-
enced her own; that she herself is not only in
sympathy with the great movement which her
prefatory note says is sweeping over the world,
but is a part of it, as her connection with the
clubs gives her the opportunity and the right
to be. "The Prophets of the Nineteenth Cen-
tury" has received warm endorsement. Caro-
line H. Dall, in the Springfield Republican, thus
commends it: "The sketches of Carlyle and
Ruskin are masterly. They seize the essential
points with a true comprehensipn, ant^ neither
the two volumes of Froude nor any that con-
cerns Ruskin give as clear an idea of the men
they celebrate." Several of Mrs. ^\'ard's books
have already been translated into other lan-
guages, amongthem being the "Prophets", which
has made its appearance in Japanese.

It will be seen that Mrs. Ward's work gives
her a right to distinction. Yet the woman
behind it is more than any expression of herself
in her writings and lectures. The sketch of
her written by Kate Sanborn for a Boston
paper a few years ago is so exact a portrait



50



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



that one does not like either to add to or take
away from the picture. Miss Sanborn says:
"Mrs. Ward possesses a simphcity of manner
that comes only with sinc(&gt;rity of purpose, the
best breeding, and a hacking of desirable an-
cestry; an executive ability that is never marred
by its too frecjuent accompaniment— a domi-
neering spirit and a desire for control; a straight,
clear outlook from eyes that hide no secrets,
a hand-grasp that is cordial, without being
effusive. One is impressed by the apparent
ease with which she accomplishes great tasks.
She does not talk of her work, nor take herself
too seriously, and is delightfully free from ped-
antry. What she has done for other women,
spiring a scholarly si)irit, giving history and



m



literature in conden-sed and attractive talks,
lifting them above the narrow interests, petty
jealousies, and the gossipy hal)it, cannot be
told in this brief outline." Of her part in the
clubs Miss Sanborn adds: "She is impartial,
well poised, never capricious in manner or
opinion. She follows the middle path. As
hostess, teacher, author, friend, she is always
natural, kindly, thinking of others. And so
love and appreciation and the truest friendship
are given to her by all who are so foi-tunate as
to know her and her work."

To this might be added just one thing more —
that Mrs. Ward has the art of drawing from
her friends the heartiest and most loyal service.
When a piece of work is to be done to which
she cannot give time or attention, she knows
on whom to call; and those who know and love
her feel it a privilege to do her behest, being
assured that when they in turn need help she
will more than repay their services, or that
they have been more than repaid already. It
is in such a woman that the Massachusetts
clubs have placed their confid(&gt;nce, in her hands
the direction of the Federation at present is
held.

Her report to the Massachusetts State Fed-
eration of the biennial meeting at Los Angeles
in June, 1902, is a model of clearness and brev-
ity, and is the best exposition of her spirit
under the trying circumstances of the conven-
tion. This is its conclusion: "The i)est gift
that can be given to any of us is the i)rivilege
of being of some use in the world. . . . The re-



ward is in the work itself, even though we may
have to wait years for the tangible results.
Let us hope that in this co-operation, with the
women of the East and the West, the North
and the South, working side by side for the
same object, unworthy prejudices and antag-
onisms may be outgrown and cast aside, so
that eventually we shall all stand together for
the good of humanity."



MARY SUSAN GOODALE, former
l)resident of the Department of Mas-
sachusetts, Woman's Relief Corps,
is a native of Boston. Descended
from early colonial and Revolutionary stock,
she inherits patriotism. Her father, Joseph
Lorraine Goldthwait, merchant and public-
spirited citizen of Boston at the time of the
Civil AVar, was a lineal descendant in the
eighth generation of Thomas' Goklthwaite, an
innnigrant of 1630 or 1631; and through his
mother, whose maiilen name was Hannah
Alden, he traced his ancestry to John and
Priscilla (Mullins) Alden. The descent from
Thomas' Goldthwaite was through his son
Sanniel,- who married Elizabeth, daughter of
Ezekiel ('heever, the famous master of the
Boston Latin School. The line continued
through Cai)t. John'' Goldthwaite, born in Salem
in 1678; Major lienjamin\ born in Boston in
1704; Benjamin^ l)orn in 1743, resided in
Maiden and Boston: John", married Sally Morris
and resided in Boston; Joseph Gleason', born
in 1798, married in 1820, Mrs. Hannah Alden
Mansfield, daughter of Solomon Alden (Simeon^
Samuel^ Joseph^-, John') and widow of Wil-
liam Mansheld, to Joseph Lorraine^ above
named, who was born in Boston in 1821.

Major lienjamin Goldthwaite is reported to
have passed most of his life as a soldier. He
was a Captain in the Louisburg expedition of
1745 and Major in that of 1758. His death
occurred in 1761 in Milford, Mass. His son
Benjamin was one of the volunteers from Lynn
who responded to the Lexington alarm. Tra-
dition says he was working in the field when
the alarm was given, and threw tlown his hoe
and started at once for Lexington.

Joseph L. (ioldthwait during the Civil War

organized a society for the care of soldiers'
families, eontributinp; liberally to its funds.
Being an invalid at that time, he was unable
to enlist, but his jjersonal efforts and financial
support were of great service. He died in
1868. He married, October 23, 1842, Lydia
Ann, daughter of Norton' and Lydia (Christie)
Newcomb. Her father was l)orn in Braintree
in 1796, was descended from Francis' New-
comb through John," ^ Isaac,* Captain Thomas,'^
Remember."

Captain Thomas Newcomb, of Braintree,
Mass., a great-great-grandfather of Mrs. Good-
ale, was Second Lieutenant, May 8, 1775, in
Captain Seth Thomas's independent company.
As First Lieutenant of the company he served
at barracks in Braintree, January 1 to Novem-
ber 1, 1776; also in Captain Seth Turner's com-
pany. Colonel Thomas Marshall's regiment, at
Hull, October .31, 1776, to January 1, 1777. Li
September, 1777, he was enrolled as a ('aptain
in Colonel Theophilus Cotton's regiment, which
marched on a secret expedition to Rhode Island.
Honorably discharged October 31, 1777, he
again enlisted and was ccjnnnissioned Captain
in a three months company in Colonel Eben-
ezer Thayer's regiment, which re-enforced
the Continental army, a jiart of the company
being stationed at West Point and a part at
Rhode Island. On August 15, 1781, he was
made Captain in Colonel Joseph Webb's regi-
ment, in which he served four months on duty
at Peekskill, N.Y. He also saw service in Paul
Revere's artillery.

The Newcomb genealogy states that Captain
Newcomb offered to receive his pay in potatoes,
and that the offer was gladly accepted by the
authorities. He was very successful in raising
companies for the war, and would accept no
higher position than the grade of Captain.
This was in accordance with a pledge he had
made, that he would remain in charge of the
company as long as permitted bj^ his superior
officers. With him in the service were his
three sons, the youngest entering the army
when he was only fourteen years of age.

Captain Newcomb's wife cheerfully kept the
house, caretl for the little ones, and wished sh(^
had more sons to give to her country. Re-
member Newcomb, the third son, married



Susannah Brackett, daughter of William Brack-
ett, a Revolutionary .soldier. William Brack-
ett's name appears on the Lexington alarni
rolls. In 1777 he is recorded as a member of
Captain Thomas Newcomb's independent com-
pany, and in 1778 he appears with the rank of
gunner in Captain Callender's company, Colonel
Crane's regiment. His name was on pay-roll
dated January 11, 1781. He served almost
continuously until September, 1781, first in
Colonel Benjamin Lincoln's regiment and next
in Captain Seth Thomas's company. He died
a .soldier's death at Plattsburg in the War of
1812.

Mary Susan Goldthwait (Mrs. Goodale) re-
ceived her early education in the public schools
of Boston, and finished her course of study in
Medford schools, her parents having removed
to that city in 1854. The lessons of loyalty
taught her by a patriotic -father were deeply
impres.sed upon her mind. Although only a
school-girl when the Civil War began, she was
interestetl in the sokliers, and solicited money
with which she furnished a Thanksgiving din-
ner to their families in her neighborhood. On
January 7, 1868, she was married to Captain
George L. Goodale.

Mrs. Goodale is a charter member of S. C.
Lawrence Relief Corps, No. 5, of Medford,
which was instituted May 27, 1879. She
.served that year as senior vice-president, was
installed as president January, 1880, and re-
elected three successive years. At the annual
convention of the Department of Massachu-
setts, W. R. C, in 1881, she proved very effi-
cient in committee work, and when the board
of directors of the Department met in April,
1881, she was cho.sen a member of the commit-
tee on the SoUliers' Home Bazaar, which was
held in Mechanics' Building, Boston, in De-
cember, 1881. Mrs. Goodale was secretary of
the Union table.

She was chosen by the board of directors of
the Department W. R. C. to fill a vacancy in
the office of Department Conductor in the
latter part of 1881, was re-elected to the office
at the annual convention in 1882, and a year
later was elected senior vice-president. Mrs.
(ioodale was cho.sen Department president in
January, 1884. During the first year of her ad-

ministration she instituted sixteen corps. She
was unanimously re-elected Department presi-
dent at the annual convention in 1885, during
which year over one thousand members and
sixteen corps were adiled to the roster.

In her address to the next convention -(Janu-
ary, 1885) she said: —

"I cannot give you full particulars of my
labors during the year, but will briefly say that
I have represented the Department on seventy-
three difTerent occasions, written six hundred
and thirty-eight letters and a large number of
postal cards, travelled over nineteen hundred
miles (not inchuling the weekly trips to head-
quarters on Wednesdays).

"The work of the Department has assumed
such proportions that I am led to reconunend
that this convention adopt measures for the
appointment of a corps of aides, corresponding
to the aides appointeil by the Department con-
vention of the Grand Army of the Republic.
It would be the duty of the.se aides to become
thoroughly acquainteil with all the workings of
the order, holding them.selves in readiness to
act in any capacity."

This system of assigning s{)ecial duties to
Department aides has since been adojjted in
ail the States and also by the National W. R. C.

A gold watch, suitably inscribed, was pre-
sented to Mrs. Goodale upon her retirement
from the presidency.

Mrs. Goodale has participated in national
conventions, servetl on special committees by
appointment of the national presiilent, and
represented Massachusetts one year as national
corresponding .secretary. She served as chair-
man of the Department table in the Soldiers'
Home Carnival, the proceeds of which netted
four thousand dollars to the carnival treasury.
She rendered efficient service in the kettledrum
given under the auspices of the Ladies' Aid
Association of the Soldiers' Home, and for sev-
eral years has served as a member of the Com-
mittee on Department W. R. C. Rooms at the
home. From 1893 to 1899 Mrs. Goodale was
secretary of the Memorial P'und Conmiittee,
having charge of the work for soldiers' widows
and arm}' nurses. Since 1899 she has .served
continuously as chairman of the Department
Relief Coirmiittee. This is a position of re-



sponsibility: it not only necessitates the wise
expenditure of thousands of dollars, but also
a familiarity with pension laws, dealings with
the office of the State Aid Commissioner, the
Soldiers' Relief Bureau, visits to the sick, the
transportation of needy veterans to various
cities and towns and to Soldiers' Homes.

The relief work incident to the Spanish-
American War has also received valuable aid
from Mrs. Goodale. She is interested in the
Daughters of the American Revolution, and
was the first regent of the Sarah Bradlee Fulton
Chapter, of Medford, serving two years. She
is at present (1902) one of the Board of Direc-
tors of the Medford Home for Aged Men and
Women. She is an interesting and influential
speaker, and has addressed many public gath-
erings.

Mrs. Gootlale is prominent in the social and
educational afl'airs of Medford. She was one
of the earliest members of the Woman's Club
of that city. In 1900 she was elected vice-
president of the club, but resigned, as she went
to Cuba in November of that year, remaining
until April, 1901, at Columbia Barracks, Que-
mados (eight miles from Havana), where her
husband, who had enlisted to serve in the
Spanish-American War, was stationed as As-
sistant Brigade Quartermaster.

Captain Goodale was in the Forty-third
Massachu.setts Reginient during the Civil War.
lie is a Past Conunander of S. C. Lawrence
Post, No. 66, G. A. R., of Medford, also a Past
Department Commander of the Grand Army

chairman of the Executive Committee of Ar-
rangements for the national encampment in
Boston in 1890, and was Inspector-general on
the stafT of Commander-in-chief Weissert in
in 1894. In April, 1901, he was appointed by
President McKinley a Captain in the regular
army and given charg(^ of important work at

t GUISE HUMPHREY -SMITH.— The
subject of this sketch was first
__J known to the writer when she was not
Mrs. Humphrey-Smith nor^ even Miss
Humphrey, but simply and sweetly Louise.
We were not reared in the same neighborhood,
yet quite near each other; and as youth and
maiden we formed a frientlship whicJi, through
many years and many vicissitudes, has held
fast till now, and which in some degree qualifies
me to speak of her.

The town in which she was reared was Turner,
Me. Her neighborhood was Bradfonl Village,
through which flows the Nezinseot River. The
village, a small and unpretentling farming com-
munity, was large enough for a considerable
circle of neighborly relations, and contained
two men, a physician and a minister, of more
than strictly local importance. The physician,
Dr. Philip Bradfonl, was of perhaps no high
rank in his profession, but he practised it with
fair success, and directed to wise ends the influ-
ence which his position gave him. The elders
certainly looked up to him, and sought his
advice on many matters outside his medical
studies; and I suspect there were few young
people about him who ditl not incur an extra-
professional debt to him. Their interests in-
terested him, and his homely counsel ami genial
sympathy were ever for them. The minister,
the Rev. William R. French — it is ever with a
hush of reverence that I speak of him. He
was one of those ministers, becoming rarer and
rarer, who take small place and abide in it
content, and are no less strenuous in their ser-
vice because their parishioners are poor and
few. He might have served as the model of
the preacher of the "Deserted Village," or the
" Pourc Persoun" of the "Canterbury Tales."
He had the instincts and the training of a
scholar. In the pulpit he was not eloquent,
but he was wise, and in his pastoral walk he



conveyed the impression both of holiness and
the beauty of it. There floats into my mind,
as peculiarly applicable to him, a stanza from
an elegy on Sidney included in some editions
of the works of Spenser: —

" A sweet attractive kiude of grace,
A full assurance given by lookes,
Continuall comfort in a face.

The lineaments of Gospell bookes;
I trowe that countenance cannot lie,
Whose thoughts are legible in the eie."

He was peculiarly useful to young people.
While they revered him, they could be easily
familiar with him; and he showed them their
possibilities, sympathized with their aspira-
tions, corrected, encouraged, and led them on.
If our friend were to undertake a statement of
her obligations, I suspect she would confess
no greater debt to any other than to him.
Antl of great importance to her early life must
have been a considerable group of young people
who aspired, some of whom have since acquitted
themselves well. Somehow they had caught
hokl upon the truth that the better portion of
the world was beyond their horizon, and that
it was only l)y the highway of culture that they
could reach that fairer ami ampler realm. The
resources for culture were not bountiful, but
they were not altogether wanting. The Ai-
lantic Monthly anil Harper s Magazine, though
not widely taken, were yet to be seen. The
current literature was for most part beyond our
reach, but a few classics we had — Pope, Thom-
son, Goldsmith, Burns, Byron, Milton, Shake-
speare, foo(.l for noble hungering; and these were
read. The minister above mentioned here bore
some aid. With an eye to the needs of his
young people, he put into his Sunday-school
library books of real literary value in place of
the current stories of good little boys and girls
who died so discouragingly young.

Such was the more general environment of
Mrs. Humphrey-Smith's girlhood, wanting many
things indeed, but not without its smile upon
an earnest life. We come to her home. In
its general appearance it was like the homes
about her, perhajis, on the whole, a little better
than the average. The house, still standing,
but tenantless ami decaying, is a small cottage
upon a hillside. Within it in her day was no



54

penury, no luxury, but plain comfort and un-
pretending dignity. The family was consider-
able, and servants were hardly heard of in that
region; so her hands were early trained to mani-
fold domestic toil. Her parents were Henry
White and Laura Ann (Turner) Humphrey.
Her father is said to have been a descendant
of Peregrine White. Her mother was a daugh-
ter of Charles Lee Turner and grantl-daughter
of William Turner, of Scituate, Mass., who at an
early period in the Revolutionary War was on
the staff of Washington, with the rank of Major,
and later was on the staff of General Charles
Lee. A pleasant story tells that, a child having
been born to him in his absence tluring a cam-
paign, that general gave him a horse to ride
home. This chiUl, a son, was named Charles
Lee Turner. He was the grandfather of Mrs.
Humphrey-Smith.

As Mr. and Mrs. Humphrey were both from
Revolutionary sires, there was some toughness
in the grain, which we may suspect descended
to our friend ere we are through. Though she
may be pleased to acknowledge in her.self some
of the qualities of her father, it is probable that
her more characteristic features are drawn from
her mother, of whom accordingly a word.
Though the unpretending servant of many
cares, she was much more than an ordinary
woman. Her early opportunities were poor
enough, but through the eagerness of her mind
she acquired an education that was consider-
able. She and another young lady together
led the way of womankind in that region in
the study of Latin. This was, of course, to
the wonder of the practical about her, who
could not see how Latin could be of any use
in housekeeping, and who perhaps felt with
Milton that one tongue was enough for a woman.
To be sure, there were other things that she
might have studied quite as profitably; the
important fact was that. she studied something,
that her mind reached out for more than the
common satisfaction. And what she gained,
Latin and whatever else, if of no use in her
housekeeping, was of incalculable use to herself.
The allotments of her life were not easy, scanty
means and seven children were her portion,
but through the interests of her mind she coun-
terpoi.se(l them. From the pressure of her cares



she might have degenerated into a drudge;
through her intellectual interests she preserved
the fair estate of a woman. It goes without
saying, too, that these interests were most
profitable to her children, animating a cease-
less watch and toil and sacrifice for their edu-
cation.

To Mrs. Humphrey-Smith's education we
now come. Her schooling was in the main in
the schools of the town. These, however,
brought within reach a range of study that was
considerable. The district, or common, schools
had, of course, their elementary curriculum,
to which they were officially supposed to be
restricted. But, given a teacher who had
knowledge and good nature, the possible
achievement was much more than this; and
such a teacher was often provided, with a view
to the needs of more ambitious pupils. In
a brief recitation before school in the morning
or a half-hour or so after school in the evening
how much could be done! I myself thus
brought out of the common school Smyth's
treatise on algebra, than which at that day
no college in the country would have given
me more, some knowledge of geometry, astron-
omy, physical geography, and two books of
Virgil. But we also had a peripatetic high
school supported by a fund, which gave us a
term every autumn in three districts of the
town. This was distinctly for higher studies.
In both district and high school our friend
comes before me, a happy memory. Her
eager mind took whatever there was for it. In
all her studies she excelled ; in one line, however,
she was incomparable. Others might keep
pace with her in language or in mathematics;
but no one, pupil or teacher, could read as she
could. Her reading was without ostentation,
but. it thrilled and charmed. It comes home
to me now as I write — the justness of her em-
phasis, the faultlessness of her articulation,
the melody of her intonation. There are pas-
sages of literature floating in ni}' memory,
choice in themselves, but doubly valued be-
cause associated with the music of her tones.
As I look back now, I see that her reading was
informed by a nascent dramatic jiower which in
its development has enthralled multitudes since.

when, discovering the musical genius of Jenny
Lind, she urged and, through urging, accom-
pUshed her musical education. What might have
happened had Charlotte Cushman chanced to
visit that village school-house and tliscovered, as
she might easily have done, a genius of her own
great art in this village maiden!

She was given a year at the Hebron Acad-
emy, a school of no low degree, and with this
her schooling ended, though something in the
way of private instruction in Latin and in Eng-
lish was given her. Her educational advan-
tages, as here summarized, have a meagre look;
but it was not the fashion of that day to send
young ladies to college, and, if it had been,
perhaps the family exchequer would not have
been equal to the outlay. But healthy appe-
tite has a knack of finding fooil, and her appe-
tite was not only healthy, but insatiable. How-
ever it was done, she found her nourishment,
and developed on it into a finely poised and
cultivated woman.

She taught school for a time with marked
success. Marriage, however, came, and soon
after she crossed the continent with her hus-
band and settled in Portland, Ore. Her hus-
band, Daniel French Smith, of Turner, the son
of Timothy and Jane (French) Smith, a family
of good standing in the town, was worthy of
her, and all went well for a time. They brought
to the task of life high purpose, industry, fru-
gality, intelligence, and in the union of these
there is ever good augury. One thing, how-
ever, was wanting. Her husband had borne
a part in the Civil War, and brought home from
it an insidious malady, with which he struggled
for a time, but to which he must succumb at
last. A child had been given her. It com-
forted her for a brief period, and died. Her
own health gave way; and she rose at last from
a protracted illness to find that, whether through
legal legerdemain or plain thievery does not mat-
ter now, her worldly possessions had been taken
from her. Here was exigency in which had
she sunk in despair she could have been for-
given. She was not, however, that kind of
woman. The Puritan and the Revolutionary
strains in her ancestry here manifest them-
selves. Perhaps she could have sunk into the
arms of affection and wept, but not possibly



into the embrace of adversity to grieve and
whine. "The best use of Fate," says Emerson,
"is to teach us a fatal courage," and this best
use she drew to her service. In the decrees
of her will and through the energies of her con-
duct fate was out-fated. She must do some-
thing for her maintenance, she would do some-
thing for the world; and, not unnaturally, she
bethought her of the talent she possessed in
such ample measure. She got instruction from
acknowledged masters, toiled, struggled — won!

For twelve years she has been a teacher of
elocution in the Irving Institute in San Fran-
cisco and for seventeen years in the California
College in Oakland. Since she first took up
her work, she has had rooms in San Francisco,
where she has instructed and still instructs
such as come — actors, teachers, lecturers, min-
isters, any who may have interest in elocution-
ary or histrionic art. Her specialty is dramatic
expression, and many who have been her pupils
are now on the ilramatic stage. She carries
into her work a genius that is masterful and an
enthusiasm that inspires. It is no trifling cir-
cumstance to come under her criticism, for her
exposure of faults is — we might say without
mercy but for the fact that in its very nature
it is merciful. It is ruled, however, by an un-
failing tact.

In no department of human interest are
superficiality and charlatanry more common
than in hers, met in men and women who are
impatient of the slow progress and long toil
that leail to excellence, or are willing to offer
highly colored fustian for royal purple. Against
both she puts forth a protest which, if not
always heeded, is yet widely felt. The stand-
ard of public demand has undoubtedly been
lifted by her influence. In and about San
Francisco charlatanry is less prosperous be-
cause she is there. Her art is not her religion,
yet, through her utter devotion, represents it.
She believes in her art as a ministry to man's
higher needs. It is not merely to entertain,
but also to instruct and quicken. But these
ends are sacrificed if its stantlard is mean.
Make it high, make it noble, and it shall be
cleansing and uplifting. On this thenic her
elo(iuence never tires.

It is, however, on the platform that some



56



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



of us like best to think of her. Here she is a
radiant figure. Presence, manner, voice, all
contribute to an impression that is sometimes
wonderful.

She is sometimes spoken of as a public reader,
why I know not, for she never reads. She care-
fully memorizes her selections, and this all the
way from a lyric of Whittier to a drama of
Shakespeare. Thus steeping her mind in them,
she can not only inter])rct them, but incarnate
them. Their humor, piety, passion, pathos,
smilfe and aspire and glow and weep in her.
She is extremely fond of Browning, has studied
him widely and deeply, and in her public reci-
tations done not a little to extend his influence.
It seems a daring thing to carry Browning to
a popular audience, but she has done this re-
peatedly with superb success. She has great
power of personation, through which the suc-
cessful presentation of an elaborate drama lias
been with her a frequent achievement. Brown-
ing's " Blot in the 'Scutcheon" she has rendered
to audiences of three thousand, which she en-
thralled. I once heard her render "The Mer-
chant of Venice," in herself a whole troupe of
dramatic stars. Every feature of the rendering
charmed me; but the feature that especially
impressed me was the facility with which she
transformed herself into the likeness of her vari-
ous characters. That Antonio shoukl come be-
fore us was not surprising, for he opens the
play, and the personation of one character is
achievement with which we are familiar; but
Salarino and Solanio and Bassanio and Grati-
ano were as distinctly there. In the flow of
the dialogue so many men could not have pre-
served the individuality of these characters
more successfully. Afterward, in a group of
those who had been present, it was interesting
to hear them give judgment as to her better
part: it occurred to no one to specify her poorer.
To me her more successful personation seemed
her Shylock. If there be moral advantage in
seeing in vice its own deformity, we received a
useful lesson that evening. But there was her
Portia, and some were sure that her higher
achievement was the personation of her.
Others saw the finer stroke in some aspect of
her recital of the billing and cooing of Lorenzo
and Jessica. Through all, however, it was a



discussion of excellences: she had given us
nothing else for discussion.

From a mass of press notices of her work I
learn that her more recent recitals have been
the "Blot in the 'Scutcheon," before men-
tioned, and Stephen Phillips's " Paolo and Fran-
cesca." From their great variety of character,
their delicate shadings of sentiment, their
pathos, triumjih, tragedy, for one person to
present these dramas even passably well would
require talent of a high order. Yet these no-
tices are one and all testimonials, not of fair
achievement, but of proud success. They come
from diverse sources, but there is no dilTerence
in the general juilgment; and they impart to
my mind the suspicion that in these later efTorts
she has beaten her best hitherto. While, how-
ever, there is no difference in the general judg-
ment, there is a tlifference in the point of em-
phasis. Prevailingly they witness to the gen-
eral and popular effect. One or two write, as
artists, of the manner, personation, intonation.
Neither order of representation can be ade-
quate: for any just account of her, both are
absolutely needful. While our friend has stud-
ied her art broadly and deeply, its spirit has
become life within her. Hence, when she deals
with a public assembly, there is no suggestion
of artifice. All seems as natural as her most
quiet parlor conversation. Nothing is for
effect, nothing is exaggerated. Rant, by which
like artists of a lower order seek to prosper,
and unhappily often do, is far, far from her.
There is such harmony of detail with detail, and
all so related to the grand meaning of the whole
as to make it a scene of life that is offered you.
In other words, her art is obscured by its own
perfection.

All who know Mrs. Humphrey-Smith talk of
her voice, its richness of tone, its range, its
flexibility. Its carrying power is a striking
feature. An audience of three thousand in a
hall of the best acoustic construction will test
the powers of a good speaker; yet Mrs. Hum-
phrey-Smith has recited with ease and success
to six thousand people out of doors. This sug-
gests a feature of her voice that has interested
me. It is precisely the voice I used to hear in
that country school-house. In the utterance of
the stormiest dramatic passion any schoolmate

of those distant years would recognize it. It
is the same voice with its grand possibilities
unfolded.

With fine conversational powers and ready
sympathy and the large resource she has gath-
ered in her studies, she is a most agreeable
companion and in society a happy presence.
Of those who meet her there, few can ever
suspect that the magnet of her heart is a couple
of graves. Yet it is so. And here we touch
another feature of her history that tinges the
rest with a tender light. In her dealing with
the workl, though most prodigal of her smiles,
she has been frugal of her tears. Her burdens
have been many and heavy, but through all
she has carried the hand of help and the word
of cheer.

A. W. Jackson, D.D.



EMMA AUGUSTA GREELY, the head
of the Greely School of Elocution and
Dramatic Art, was born in Chelsea,
Mass., March 12, 1869, daughter of
John Lyman Greely and his wife, Octavia
Augusta Stevens. Through her father's mother
Miss Greely traces her ancestry back to Josiah
Bartlett, of Kingston, N.H., signer of the Dec-
laration of Independence, and through him to
his immigrant progenitor, Richard' Bartlett,
Sr., who in 1642 was one of the grantees of
Newbury, Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Richard Bartlett is spoken of by his-
torical writers of New England as "one
of the Wiltshire colony who came over with
the Rev. Thomas Parker in 1634." Of his
birthplace and parentage he appears to have
left no record, and vain the attempt with
the little information available to trace his
English antecedents. Mention, however, may
here be made of an interesting relic now
owned by one of his descendants, namely, a
copy of the "Breeches Bible," purchased by
Richard Bartlett, as certified in his own
handwriting on the margin of one of its pages,
in 1612 and brought by him to Newbury.
On a blank page is his record of the births of
his children— Joane, John, Thomas, Richard,
Cris (Christopher), and Anne (New England
Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. xl.).



The name Bartlett is said to be common
in Wiltshire, Devonshire, Somersetshire, and
other parts of England.

From Richard' Bartlett, of Newbury, the
line descended through RichanP (born in Eng-
land in 1621) and his wife Abigail; Richard,^
of Newbury, born in 1649, and his wife, Han-
nah^ Emery — daughter of John^ and Mary
(Webster) Emery — to Stephen,* born in New-
bury in 1691, who married in 1712 Hannah,
daughter of John^ Webster, of Newbury and
Salisbury. Stephen'' Bartlett was Deacon of
the first church of Amesbury. He died April
10, 1773, in his eighty-second year.

The Hon. Josiah Bartlett, M.D., the Rev-
olutionary patriot, son of Deacon Stephen and
Hannah (Webster) Bartlett, was born in Ames-
bury, Mass., in 1729. He settled as a physi-
cian in Kingston, N.H., where his old home-
stead is still standing, being occupied by mem-
bers of the family. He became Chief Justice
of New Hampshire in 1788, was President of
the State in 1790, 1791, and 1792, and in 1793,
under the amended constitution of New Hamp-
shire, was Governor. His wife was Mary Bart-
lett, of Newton, N.H. They had nine chil-
dren. The sons, Levi, Josiah, Jr., and Ezra,
all became physicians. The line of descent
to the subject of this sketch is through his
daughter Mary, who riiarried Jonathan Greely,
and whose son Josiah was father of John Lyman
Greely, Miss Greely's father. The Greelys were
prominent in public affairs in Kingston, and
John Lyman Greely was at one time a member
of the New Hampshire Legislature. His wife,
Octavia A. Stevens, who was born in Brentwood,
N.H., was also of an old New Hampshire
family.

Enmia Augusta Greely had the misfortune
at a very early age to lose her mother, but this
sad loss was largely compensated by the de-
voted care and sympathetic companionship
of her father, to whom she owes her broad
views of life and the development of some of
her higher personal qualities, he being a man
of lofty ideals, great sincerity of character,
and decided business ability. She was edu-
cated in the public schools, graduating from
the Chelsea High School in 1887. Even dur-
ing her school-days her inclination was toward



58



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



the study of literature and its correct inter-
pretation, and to this end she took some pri-
vate instruction in the art of expression, in the
autumn of 1888 entering the Boston School
of Oratory, under i\Ioses True Brown, principal,
and Hamlin Garland, literary instructor. In
this school, after completing both the regular
course and a post-graduate course, she ac-
cepted a position as teacher, and, entering upon
her duties in the fall of 1891, continued to teach
there until the retirement of Professor Brown
owing to ill health. She then became associate
principal with Clara Power Edgerly at the
Boston College of Oratory, of which Mrs.
Edgerly, with whom she had been associated
for a number of years, at first as her pupil, was
the founder. To this lamented teacher, now
deceased, Miss Greely owes much of her inspi-
ration in her own work, Mrs. Etlgerly's founda-
tion of common sense, sincerity, and natural-
ness in interpretation causing her pupil to
leave behind the old stilted elocutionary style.

Miss Greely has also taught in her own line
of education at the Posse Gymnasium and at
different times in various other institutions.
She was among the charter members, in 1892,
of the National Association of Elocutionists.
Since 1895 she has been a member of its
Board of Directors, and in 1901 she was made
treasurer of the association, which position she
held for two years. In October, 1900, Miss
Greely felt justified in opening the Greely
School of Elocution and Dramatic Art. This
school is in Thespian Hall, 168 Massachusetts
Avenue, Boston. It is now in its fourth year,
antl its original membership has doubled. The
graduates continue their work, some as teachers,
others upon the lyceum platform, either as
reciters or as members of dramatic companies.

Not running in a single groove, as is the wont
in some siinilai- schools, the course in the insti-
tution presided over by Miss Greely offers
general culture and a liberal education; for
the technical work of expression is fast becom-
ing a science. To quote her own wortls from
a chain letter to one of her classes while she
was abroad: "In all work and in life no sure
advancement comes with little effort. We must
each be so sincere in our work and have such
faith in it that we cannot fail. Success rests



with ourselves. If we love the work and show
people that we do, if we make manifest the
difference between the true study of the best
literature from the master minds and the
school-girl elocution; and, above all, if we
have enthusiasm in regard to its application
to daily life and soul improvement, I am sure
we shall never fail to arouse a corresponding
interest in our auditors. Do not think that
small things are unworthy your attention.
Were it possible to spring at once into the
greatest things, perhaps one's development
would suffer."

That a woman not yet in her prime should
have already accomplished so much augurs
well for her future career; for her power seems
marked by continuous growth, and, best of
all, her character keeps pace, and harmonizes
with her intellectual attainments. With the
author of "David Grieve," she realizes the
" poverty and ho])elessness of all self-seeking, the
essential wealth, rich and making rich, of all
self-spentling."



MARY PHINNEY VON OLNHAU-
Sl'^N, who rendered distinguished
services as an army nurse in two
wars of the closing half of the nine-
teenth century — the Civil War in America and
the Franco-Prussian in Europe — and was one
of the two American women upon whom the
Emperor William conferred the decoration of
honor known as the Iron Cross, was a native
of ^Massachusetts, her birthplace being the
historic town of Lexington. Born Februarj'
4, 1817, daughter of Elias and Catherine (Bart-
lett) Phinney, she was the fifth in a family of
ten children. Her father, Elias Phinney, A.M.,
(Harv. Coll. 1801), was born in Nova Scotia,
whither his parents, Jienjamin I'hinney and
his wife Susanna, had removed from Falmouth,
Mass., a few years later coming, as the church
reconls testify, to Lexington. He was of the
Cape Cod family of Phinney (name sometimes
spelled Finney), whose founder, John' Phiimey,
was in Plymouth as early as 1638, and some
years later settled in l^arnstable. According
to "Genealogical Notes of Barnstable Families,"
by Otis and Swift, the line was continued

through the immigrant's son John/ who mar-
ried Mary Rogers in 1664; Benjamin,' who
married Martha Crocker; Zaccheus/ born in
1720, who married Susan Davis; to Benjamin/
born in 1744, fatlier of Elias."

Mary Rogers, wife of John^ Phinney, was a
daughter of Lieutenant Joseph" Rogers, of Dux-
bury, Sandwich, and Eastham, who came over
with his father, Thomas' Rogers, in the " May-
flower" in 1620 ("Mayflower Descendant,'' vol.
iii. p. 254).

In 1823 Elias Phinney settled on a farm in
Lexington, which he brought to a high state
of cultivation. For many years and till his
death, in 1849, he was Clerk of the Mitldlesex
County Courts. He married in 1809 Catherine,
daughter of Dr. Josiah and Elizabeth (Call)
Bartlett, of Charlestown, Mass. Her paternal
grandfather, George Bartlett, a sea-ca]jtain,
was a native of Devonshire, England.

Mary Phinney grew to womanhood in her
native town, improving her opportunities for
learning by attending an academy, and long
after leaving school continuing her studies,
especially of modern languages, till she became
familiar with French, German, and Italian.
She likewise cultivated her native talent for
original work in drawing, becoming also an
expert in embroidery. At the School of Design
for women, started in Boston about the year
1852, of which she was one of the early pupils,
"she was considered the best designer in the
class," being numbered in subsecjuent years
with Ellen Robbins and Margaret Foley as
among those who had "distinguished them-
selves in art." This is the testimony of Mrs.
Ednah D. Cheney in her "Reminiscences," re-
cently published, she having been Miss Little-
hale, secretary of the school committee.

F'or some years she was employetl as designer
of prints in one of the large cotton-mills in
Manchester, N.H. A German political exile,
a baron named Von Olnhausen, was a chemist
in the same mill. He had been connected with
one of the great German universities, and
Theodore Parker designated him as " the most
profound scholar he had ever known." His
feudal castle, which had been the home of his
ancestors from the time of the Crusades, and
has been described as "one of the most pictur-



esque castles in Saxony, crowning a hill and
overlooking the town of Zwickau," had passed
into the hands of an alien line. Miss Mary
Phinney and Mr. Gustav A. Von Olnhausen
were married in Boston by the Rev. Theodore
Parker, May 1, 1858. The union was a happy
one, but not of long duration, the death of the
Baron (to give him his rightful title) occurring
September 7, 1860.

Only a few months later began the great
Civil War, arousing the patriotism of women
and testing the heroism of men. Mrs. Von
Olnhausen, deciding to enlist as an army nurse,
received a commission through the efforts of
Governor Andrew, but was required to pay
her own travelling expenses to the South, as
the United States government at that time
had not sufficient funds for the transportation
of additional army nurses. During the four
years' conflict she rendered faithful services
as a hospital nur.se under the direction of
Dorothea L. Dix.

It may here be mentioned that in 1873 she
was appointed first superintendent of the train-
ing-school for nurses in the Massachusetts
General Hospital, Boston, a position that she
ably filled.

Sailing for Germany in 1870, shortly after
the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, she
offered her services to the military authorities
there, who were not at first disposed to approve
her appointment. After persistent efforts, how-
ever, she received a commission as arniy nurse.
In this capacity again she had many thrilling
experiences, and her services were appreciated
as invaluable.

The first of March, 1871, found her in charge
of thirty wounded men in a hospital in
Orleans, France. Peace had been declared,
and an order had been issued for the German
soldiers to evacuate France. Some of the
wounded, however, were unable to be moved.
When the thirty in charge of this faithful nurse
no longer neeiled her care, she thought that her
duties then were completed, and accordingly
made arrangements to depart for Berlin. As
she was entering the diligence en route for that
city, a surgeon came running from the hospital
and entreated her to remain, as sixteen wounded
men had just arrived. She did not hesitate,

but in the midst of danger promptly resumed
her work. The people of Orleans were enraged
at the Germans, and the mayor of the city,
realizing the danger to "the little Madam," as
she was often called, gave her his protection.
He acconipanietl her to the hospital every
morning at six o'clock, and, when her duties
for the day were finisheil, at nine in the evening,
he called at the hospital and accompanied her
to his home. These duties were continued for
more than a month, and then the fifteen men
who survived (one of the wounded having died)
started on their way to Berlin, in charge of
the Madam, by order of the military authori-
ties. They were obliged to halt in secluded
places for fear of angry mobs.

An interesting sketch of this journey was
given in the Boston Globe, from which the fol-
lowing is taken: "It was a strange procession
that moved through the streets of Vendome.
First came three dump carts, each carrying
a n an who had undergone an operation the
day before, ami who lay on the straw groaning
with every motion. Behind was a diligence,
on the floor of which sat a little American
woman, surrounded by twelve badly wounded
men, three of whom rested their weary heads
in her lap.

"It was bitterly cold, and the men were
clothed only in their undergarments, with one
blanket each. The}^ shivered and whined with
the cold. Twice during the day they sto])ped,
while their wounds were dressed and refresh-
ments were distributed. In the late afternoon
they came to a railway station, only to find
that the expected ambulance would not arrive
until the next day. With great difficulty
Madam had her men carried to a half-ruined
castle. There they spent the night in the old
barracks, which were deserted and forlorn. The
rats ran across the bare floors, gusts of wind
swept through the lonely corridors. No doors
shut out the cold, these having been used for
fuel long before.

"First one sufferer and then another cried
out with pain and terror. In the midst of it
all the little American woman was calm and
unterrified. She remained awake the whole
night through, comforting her charges. During
the next forenoon a messenger came from the



station to announce that the ambulance had
arrived. The sick soldiers were carried to the
train and placed in an empty baggage car, and
she was about to follow, when the station agent
pulletl her by the arm, saying 'There is no req-
uisition for you. The requisition is for a
surgeon.' The little Madam drew herself to
her full height of five feet, and answering, 'I
am a surgeon,' she seized the paper, and signed
it in a bold, masculine hand, 'Von Olnhausen.'
Then, before any one could interfere, she was
in the car.

"The ride to Orleans was a long, cold one.
Rain was falling. It dripped through the roof,
and she took off her skirt to cover one of the
men. When they reached Orleans, the men
were removed to a convent. On the way the
mobs in the streets kicked mud at them, and
even the women howled and swore at them.
The sisters of the convent refused to give Madam
either food or lodging. The sick men collected
a thaler (seventy-five cents), and with this the
brave little woman secured a bed at an inn.
She was put in a chamber over the bar-room,
was kept awake all night by the noise from
below, where men howled and sang and cursed
the Germans. She ])ulled the bureau and
chairs against the door, and spent a night of
torture. But her seventy-five cents was not
enough for food, and, when she returned at
daylight to the convent, the sisters still refused
her even a mnvithfiil. She had eaten nothing
since noon of the previous day.

"Another nerve-trying trip was made back
to the station-house, the mob growing so furi-
ous that the little band was hurried into the
baggage-room to be out of tlanger. No train
was in sight, and the sick men, exhausted by
their long journey and discouraged by the delay,
cried like children. Little Madam, hungry an(l
dishcarteneil as she was, cheered them with
war songs and told her most thrilling stories.
At noon she went out and demanded footl of
the inspector. He loaned her two tlialers, and
with this she bought bread and sausages and
coffee for the men, who ate and drank every
bit, forgetting the twenty-four-hour fast of the
stanch-hearted little woman to whose watchful
care they owed their lives.

"At four in the afternoon two German offi-



RErRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



61



cers came and took the little hand on stretchers
to the ambulance train, which was waiting a
([uarter of a mile away. For fear of the mob,
gendarmes walked besitle the wounded, antl
they reacheil the train in safetj'.

"When the men were made comfortable.
Madam asked for food. She declares that the
great bowl of oatmeal porridge, thick with
prunes, which she received, was the most de-
licious meal she has ever eaten. When they
reached Berlin, the men were ])laced in a hos-
pital, and, thanks to the untiring care of the
little American, every one of them recovered."

In recognition of these meritorious services
Emperor AVilliam i)re.sented her with the Iron
Cross, she and Clara Barton being the only
American women to receive that decoration.
It is a handsome Maltese cross, of iron with
white enamel, the liadge of a Prussian order
founded in ISIX for military services, and re-
organized in 1870. After her return to her na-
tive land the Emperor sent her the Metlal of
Merit, which is the highest honor conferred in
Germany for bravery in war, and has been
given to no other American, it is said. I'n-
fortimately, the medal was lost in transmission,
hut she received the autograjih letter written
by the Emperor when foi'warding the precious
gift. During Prince Henry's recent visit to
Boston (March, 1902) Mrs. Von Olnhausen,
wearing the Iron Cross, was greeteil by him
most cordially, he expressing his surprise and
delight to see the decoration worn by an Amer-
ican woman. " It is a great honor in my coun-
try," said he. " Please tell me how you came
to receive it." He promised her that upon
his return he would see that the Medal of Merit
was in her possession, in accordance with his
grandfather's wishes. This promise she did
not live to see fulfilled. It may be said to
have been cancelled by her ileath, which soon
followed, April 12, 1902.

The home of Mrs. Von ( )lnhausen in her later
years was at the Grundmann Studios, Claren-
don Street, Boston, where she enjoyed a quiet
life with her embroideiy work and designing.
She was young in spirit, and her host of friends
always found a cordial welcome.

They observed lier birthdays witli gifts and
flowers. She was especially interested in Jap-



anese art. She received numerous orders for
her work after the interview with Prince Henry,
an account of which was widely published.

Loyal, patriotic, courageous, unselfish, a
lover of art and literature, a friend of human-
ity, she will he mis.setl by many who enjoyed
her friendship and appreciated her worth. Her
funeral was held at Mt. Auburn, and was at-
tended by the Massachusetts Army Nurse Asso-
ciation, of which she was a loved member, and
in whose meetings she often participated. The
Iron Cross was bei I ueathed l)y Mrs. Von Olnhausen
to the Lexington Historical Society. Her life,
compiled from her letters antl journals by her
nephew, James Phinney Munroe, has recently
been published, by l&gt;ittle. Brown &amp; Co., under
the title: "Adventures of an Ai-niv Nurse in
Two Wars."



IDA SUMNER VOSE WOODBURY was
born in Dennysville, Me., December 14,
1854. She is the daughter of Peter Eh-
enezer and Lydia (Kilby) Vose, and is the
ninth in descent from Robert Vose, who came
from England to Dorchester (now Milton),
Mass., in 1635. Her ancestral lines, some of
which, it is said, have been traced to the time
of Edward III. of England, include represent-
atives of the families of Thacher, Sumner,
Oxenbritlge, Prince, Hinckley, Adams, Howard,
Hayden, and others, a roll of which one may
well he proud. Miss Vose was graduated from
the high school at the age of sixteen, and for
four years was engaged as a teacher in the
schools of her native town, at the same time
pursuing an advanced course of study with
a private instructor. She was a brilliant
scholar and a successful teacher.

In 1876 she was married to Clinton Aaron
Woodbury, who was at that time editor of the
Somerset Reporter. For some years she as-
sisted her husband in etliting the literary de-
partment of the paper, making valuable contri-
butions to its colunms and also to the columns
of other journals. She frequently delights her
friends by her poems, written for anniversaries
and other occasions. A specimen of these
may be found in the publishetl volume, "The
Poets of Maine." Later Mr. Woodbury en-



62



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



tered upon a business career in Portland, and
resided there with his family for several years.
Mr. and Mrs. Woodbury were prominent in
educational, literary, and religious work in the
city. In 1888 Mrs. Woodbury was elected
president of the Maine Woman's Aid to the
American Missionary Association. This office
she held for twelve years, tluring which,
under her efficient and enthusiastic leatlership,
the Woman's Aid made steady growth and
awakened much interest throughout the State
in its special work.

After the death of Mr. Woodbury, in 1894, it
became necessary to make a change of residence,
and Mrs. Woodbury removed to Boston. In
1895 she was made New England Field Assist-
ant of the American Missionary Association,
the society which is doing such a good work
in our country among the mountain whites,
the Negroes, the Chinese, and the Indians, in
its efforts to educate, uplift, and make good
citizens of the.se neglected classes. A grander
and more patriotic work than this it woukl be
hard to imagine: it is well worthy the em-
ployment of the highest talents.

Since entering upon the duties of her present
position, Mrs. Woodbury has been engaged in
speaking for the association in churches through-
out the East and West, before young men's
clubs, women's meetings and conferences, and
delivering adtlresses at G. A. R. memorial
services, and so forth. She speaks on an aver-
age six times a week, and travels from fifteen
to twenty-five thousand miles a year. She is
a pleasing speaker, calm, easy, and self-pos-
sessed in manner, and dignified in bearing. She
has the rare gift of a voice feminine and fine
in quality, but full, clear, and far-reaching,
easily heard in all parts of a large audience
room. Her thorough acquaintance with the
work of the American Missionary Association
and her personal knowledge of the good already
accomplished by it give her full command of
her subject, and make her an exceedingly
effective speaker. Tho.se of us who have heard
her once gladly welcome her again. She is one
of the few women who can take up the cause
of the oppressed and so present it that no one
who hears her can fail of being interested, and
of seeing clearly how necessary it is to the life



of the republic that justice should be done to the
lowest and weakest within its borders.

A leading clergyman has said of Mrs. Wood-
bury, "She is easily one of the greatest femi-
nine powers of the early twentieth century in
the advocacy of American patriotic Christian
philanthropy.''

Mrs. Woodbury has had four children. The
eldest, Carl Vose, was graduated from Bowdoin
College in 1899, and is now a professor in Nor-
wich University, Northfield, Vt. The second,
Donald Clinton, died in childhood. The third,
Malcolm Sumner, was graduated from Bowdoin
in 1903, and is now a medical student in the
same institution ; and the fourth, Ruth Lin-
coln, is in the high school at Dennysville, Me.

ELIZABETH ORR WILLIAMS, journal-
ist and lecturer, resides in Brookline,
Mass. She is the wife of Melvin Brooks
Williams, grandson of Captain John
\\'illiams, of ha))py memory, of Portland, Me.
Mrs. A\'illiams was born in Alfred, Me., being
the daughter of the Rev. John and Mary (Moore)
Orr. The original home of the Orr family was
in Scotland, whence some of their number re-
moved, doubtless in the latter part of the sev-
enteenth century, to Ireland.

John Orr, great-great-grandfather of Mrs.
^\'illianls, came to this country from tlie north
of Ireland in 1726, in cjuest of civil and religious
liberty, and resided for a time in Londonderry,
N.H. In 1750 he was one of the petitioners
for the incorporation of the town of Bedford,
N.H. It is not known whether he was born in
Scotland or born in Ireland of Scottish parents.
Both he and his l)rothcr Daniel, who came with
him, are believed to have been teachers by
profession. John Orr, it is said, was remark-
able for his Scotch wit, and was highly respected
as a "fine specimen of a shrewd, pious, plain-
hearted Scotcliman, much like the one por-
trayed by Scott in the father of Jeanie Deans,
in the 'Heart of Midlothian.' "

Mrs. Williams's great-grandfather, the Hon.
.John Orr, was for many years an Elder in the
Presbyterian church in Bedford, servuig also
as Justice of the Peace and the Quorum, as

Senator from the Thiril District, as Counsellor
of Hillsborough County, and for several years
as Representative at the General Court of the
State of New Hampshire. He performed mili-
tary service in the French War in 1756, and in
1777 he was appointed by the Provincial Coun-
cil a member of the Committee of Safety. In
this latter year also he was commissioned as a
Lieutenant, and with his company served under
the command of General Stark at the battle
of Bennington, where, after exhibiting cool
judgment and great personal bravery, he was
wounded and rendered a cripple for life. The
verdict of one who knew him well was thus
tersely expressed: "He was one of Nature's
nobility."

His son, the Hon. Benjamin Orr, grandfather
of Mrs. Williams, was born in Bedford, N.H.,
in 1772, and was graduated at Dartmouth Col-
lege with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1798.
He became a lawyer and settled in Maine, his
home, with the exception of a few years that
he resided in Topsham, being in Brimswick.
He was eminent as a practitioner in the Su-
preme Judicial Court both before and after
the separation of Maine from Massachusetts.
He represented the old Cumberland District
in Congress during the Presidency of James
Monroe.

At the time of his death, in 1828, Chief Jus-
tice Mellen spoke of him " as one who had long
stood, confessedly, at the head of the profession
of our State; who had distinguished himself
by the depth and solidity of his understanding,
by his legal acumen and research, by the power
of his intellect, the commanding energy of his
reasoning, the uncompromising firnniess of his
principles, and the dignity and lofty sen.se of
honor, truth, and justice which he uniformly
displayed in his professional career and in the
walks of private life."

He held the positions of overseer, trustee,
and treasurer of Bowdoin College in its earlier
days. It was while he was a trustee of the col-
lege, and when he attended the annual exami-
nations of the classes in the classics, that he
was the leading influence in placing the poet
Longfellow in the chair of modern languages.
Mr. Orr, being an accomplished classical scholar,
and the Latin poet Horace being his pocket



companion, was charmed with young Long-
fellow's translation of the odes of that poet, and
at the meeting of the executive board settled
the question as follows: "Why, Mr. Longfellow
is your man : he is an admirable classical scholar.
Seldom have I heard anything more beautiful
than his version of one of the most difficult otles
of Horace."

Mr. Orr was in politics a Federalist of the
old school which maintained the sentiments of
" the men who formed and administered for
the first twelve years the institutions of the
United States." His wife, Elizabeth Toppan,
a woman of strong character, refined tastes and
manners, and domestic virtues, was well fitted
to dispense the generous hospitality of his
home in Brihiswick, Me.

Mrs. Williams's father, the Rev. John Orr,
was a graduate (summa cum laude) of Bowdoin
College in the large and brilliant class of 1834.
The Rev. Mr. Orr was a man of intellectual force
and scholastic culture, of great refinement of na-
ture, an independent, clear thinker, a man illus-
trating in his daily life high moral excellence,
a writer of decided merit, able in theological
discussion, a student and a Christian gentleman
always, as well as a brilliant preacher.

From these thoughtful men, in turn, and
from her grandmother Orr and her mother, the
late Mary Moore Orr, a woman of active intellect
and progressive thought, Mrs. Williams inherited
her love for letters, her studious habit, and her
power of application. These characteristics
evinced themselves early, and the literary turn
of her mind found expression in original stories,
poems, and essays. She sometimes wrote plays,
in which she took the leading parts herself, as
in a church festival held in the opera house in
South Bend, Ind., and in these dramatic skits
she disclosetl hi.strionic talent.

Her original humorous sketches possess the
"convulsive element" which is so vital in suc-
cessful comedy, and in this line she is a born
impersonator. A natural wit, skilled in repar-
tee, she is sympathetic antl benevolent in spirit.
The intellectual bias of her mind has always
been toward the classics and the highest order
of literature, sacred as well as secular.

•Mrs. ^\■illiams was educated at the Alfred
Academy, the Alfred High School, and Maple-



64



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



wood Institute, Pittsfield, Mass. She is a mem-
ber of the Maplewood Akimiia&gt; Association,
and at its first reunion she contributed an origi-
nal poem, which appealed with especial interest
to the members of her class wlio were present.

Mrs. Williams has musical ability of no mean
order. She played in public before she was out
of her teens, and taught instrumental music
for several years with excellent success.

When cooking-schools were first opened for
instruction, she wrote on culinary education
and the philoso])hy of good living, from the
Boston and New York cooking-schools, for
Southern, Western, and Eastern papers, often
receiving in reference to them complimentary
and a])preciative letters from utter strangers.

Mrs. Williams was a newspaper correspondent
at Mount Desert Island, Maine, for twelve sum-
mers, and was acknowletlged as an active force
in bringing into notice a section of that country
which is now widely known. Her correspond-
ence from Saratoga, at one time the queen of
Spas, was considered worthy of being j^laced on
file. It may well be said that, wherever Mrs.
Williams set the impress of her facile, graceful
pen, it exhibited that subtle ciuality recognized
as "style."

At one time Mrs. Williams was a |)aid con-
tributor to eleven newspapers. She has been
a contributor since 1881 to the Boston Tran-
script. She has also contributed to the Youth' !^
Companion, Arti^ for America, the Houaehold,
and other publications. A series of lectures
on literary, historical, and art topics she has
presented in many States with gratifying suc-
cess. In her ceramic art lectures, which are
fully illustrated by specimens, she was a pioneer,
and, having visited the leading potteries and
art museums in this country in pursuing this
fascinating branch of study, she is an acknowl-
edged authority on the subject.

Mrs. Williams has treated with consummate
skill the mystery of Mary Stuart. Her strong
rendering of the Queen's plea, on trial for her
life before the P'nglish bar, often shakes the
belief of those who have always thought the
Queen was guilty. More than that cannot be
done for a great historic doubt. Mrs. Will-
iams's essay on the subject of Mary Stuart is
pronounced by Mrs. Livermore to be a "gem



of literary condensation." A professional and
prolific writer thus expresses his appreciation:
" Mrs. Williams is one of the most alive anti
immediate students, not only in the Stuart
chronicles, the great masters of art, the litera-
ture of the. early civilizations, but in the lore
of the Queen who 'launched a thousand ships,
and burned the topless towers of Ilium,' —
Helen of Troy."

Mrs. Williams has given some of her choice
entertainments liefore several notable charities:
the Jackson Park Sanitarium for sick babies
and the Model Lodging House in Chicago,
through the auspices of the famous Archie
(Arkay) Club of that city; the Bethel Social
Settlement, Aged Couples' Home, and the Saint
Barnabas Cuild of Nurses, Minneapolis; the
Berkshire County Home for Aged Women,
Pittsfield, Mass. ; and the Educational and In-
dustrial l^nion, Buffalo, N.Y.

At a moot court, convened in Boston a few
years ago, for the trial of the cam^e celebrc, Sir
Francis Bacon vs. William Shakespeare, Mrs.
Williams, after repeatedly declining, consented
to espouse the Baconian siile, and, as the junior
l)arrister, opened the case in a most eloc[uent
and finished manner. So lawyer-like were her
arguments that she was highly praised by the
late Judge Nathaniel Holmes (formerly Dean of
the Harvard Law School, and ex- Justice of the
Supreme Judicial Court of Missouri), the late
Professor Smith, of the Dorchester Latin School,
and even by the noted Shakespearean com-
mentator, Dr. Rolfe. And yet Mrs. Williams is
not a Baconian. Personally she is rather retir-
ing, and the bulk of her work has been tione in
a quiet way. She is a member of the New
England Woman's Press Association.



GRACE LE BARON UPHAM (in the
literary world Grace Le Baron) was
iiora in Lowell, Mass., June 22, 1845,
tlu' youngest daughter of John Good-
win Locke and Jane Ermina Starkweather
Locke. Her father was a son of the Hon. John
Locke, of Ashby, Mass., and a lineal descendant
of Deacon William' Locke, of Woburn, founder
of the fauiily in New luigland. Her mother
was a tlaughter of Deacon Charles Starkweather,

65



whose immigrant ancestor, Robert' Stark-
weather, was at Roxbury in 1640, and later
settled at Ipswich.

The Hon. John Locke (Harv. Coll. 1792)
served six years as a member of Congress. He
married Hannah" Goodwin, daughter of Na-
thaniel Gooilwin, Jr., of Plymouth, and giand-
daughter of Nathaniel Goodwin, Sr., and his
wife, Lydia' Le Baron (great-great-grand-
mother of Mrs. I^pham). Lydia was a daugh-
ter of Lazarus Le Baron and grand-daughter
of Dr. Francis Le Baron, the "Nameless Noble-
man" from France, whose romantic story fur-
nished a fruitful theme for the pen of Mrs.
Jane G. Austin, and whose grave is to-day heUl
sacred in historic Plymouth. It is said
that in Mrs. Grace Le Baron Upham are evi-
denced the manners and looks of her distin-
guished French progenitor.

To the "Mayflower" and Plymouth Rock
Mrs. Upham traces back through three Bart-
lett generations, thus: The wife of Lazarus Le
Baron and mother of his daughter Lydia, above
named, was Lydia' Bartlett, daughter of Jo-
seph'' Bartlett (Joseph.^ Robert'). Robert'
Bartlett, who came in the "-Ann" in 1623,
married Mary Warren, daughter of Richard'
Warren, one of the signers of the Compact in
November, 1620.

Mrs. Jane E. Locke, singularly sweet and
gracious in character, had a fine mind. She
was a writer for the magazines and periodicals
of the day, and published several volumes of
poems. She was a contemporary anil friend
of William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel P. Willis,
and Edgar Allan Poe. In the years directly
preceding her death, which occurreil in 1859,
Grace was her constant companion, and was
privileged to meet such well-known literary
folk as Poe, Lydia Maria Child, Fanny Fern,
Mrs. Sigourney, not to mention other authors
of lesser note in their day.

Mr. Locke was equally well known in his
sphere of intellectual activity. He preserved
the family history by compiling and publish-
ing "The Book of the Lockes."

As a girl, and indeed from eai'liest infancy,
Grace had to contend with delicate healtli.
In 1850 her parents moved to Boston, and,
since all but the first five years of her life have



been passed in this city, she may be called a
Bostonian. She was graduated from every grade
of the Boston public schools, primary, grammar,
high, and normal. In 1870 she became the
wife of Henry M. Upham, son of Captain Will-
iam and Margaret (Folger) Upham, of Nan-
tucket. The Folgers, his maternal ancestors,
were of the same family as the mother of Ben-
jamin Franklin. Mr. I'pham, late of the firm
of Damrell &amp; Upham, has recently retired from
business, having been identified for thirty-six
years with that ancient landmark of Boston,
"The Old Corner Bookstore," which has borne
his name. Thus by her marriage was another
incentive given Mrs. Upham to use the talent
inherited from her parents.

When she first began to write, she did not
anticipate making authorship a j»rofession, and
so abbreviated her name. But the instantane-
ous success of her first book, "Little Miss
Faith," published in 1894 by Lee &amp; Shepard,
Boston, encouraged her to go on. In the same
year "The Ban of the Golden Rod" was pub-
lished by a New York house. Following these
came "Little Daughter," 1895; "The Rosebud
Club," 1896; "Queer Janet," 1897; "Told under
the Cherry-trees," 1890; "Jessica's Triumph,"
1901 — all published by Lee &amp; Shepard. In
1898 Little, Brown .t Co. issued " 'Twixt You
and Me." She has now in jireparation the last
of the "Janet Series" for children and a novel
for their elders. The latter has b'^en urged
upon Mrs. Upham by readers who have enjoyed
her shoit stories, which have appeared at in-
tervals in the current periodicals and maga-
zines. Mrs. Upham says, however, that she
shall alwaj's give her best strength to the
young, who have been her most sincere friends
from the first. Her stories are written with
a purpose, the pui'pose of purifying and en-
nobling the lives of children. And she has
richly earned her title, "The Children's Friend."
Many are the letters she has received from her
youthful admirers, letters filled with such earn-
est gratitude and appreciation that she counts
herself rich indeed, .to have inspired them.
That she might be sure of doing work uncolored
and unbiassed by others in a similar line of
literature, she has entirely abstained from
reading juvenile books. This may, in a meas-

ure, account for the distinctive style which is
all her own.

Mrs. Uphani's vivacity and warmth of heart
make her a favorite, and, while not a club
woman, she has a wide acquaintance with
such. It is in patriotic societies that she feels
her keenest interest, and she is a member of
the following: Daughters of the American Revo-
lution, Daughters of 1812, Society of May-
flower Descendants, Huguenot Society of Amer-
ica, belonging also to the Society of American
Authors and Boston Authors' Society, and
being an honorary Member of the League of
American Penwomen and the Ladies' Physio-
logical Institute.

A sketch of Mrs. Upham's work would be
incomplete without reference to her poems and
carols, many of the latter, written years ago,
still being sung animally, notwithstanding the
new ones offered every season.

Two short poems are given below, and many
will recall the tender beauty of " Question-
ings," which appeared originally in the Boston
Transcript, but which was widely copied and
appreciated.

The Memorial Day poem has appealed to
comrades' hearts all over the countrv: —



ROSES, LILIES, AND FORGET-ME-NOTS.

Roses (Lancaster), red War

Lilies Purity

Forget-me-nots Enduring Memories

Halt!

Comrades, bow with uncovered head,
And deem it not weakness to shed

Tears o'er his grave.
Strew flowers with Memory's hand,
Float o'er him the flag of our land
He died to save.

The red fnr the hloa/l he shed,

The vhite for his sotd so pure,
The blue for the s/,// n'erhead.

Where his name slioll ai/e embire.

lie was only a .stripling, young.
But ne'er hath the poet sung

Of one so brave.
In the carnage of shot and shell,
With the broken staff, he fell,

And found a grave.



Oh, then, scatter ye roses red.
Red, red as the blood he .shed.

And lilies white.
"Weave in the forget-me-not's hue,
A garland, red, white, and blue, —

Our emblem bright.

The red fur the bhrnd he sheil.

The irhite for his soul so pure,
The blue for the sl'ij overhead,

Where his name shall aye endure.

Nothing could be more finished or spirited
than the few comprehensive lines to John Boyle
O'Reilly:—

In fflcmoriam.

JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY.
August, 1891 — August, 1894.

(Written for The Catholic World.)

Patriot and Poet! Martyr! Exile

From out a land that should have owned thee king!

Disciple of thy Lord in suffering!
Like Him, a ransom paid, that thy green isle
Might burst its bondage chains and live to smile

In Freedom's sunlight. Sadly we do bring

To-day the shamrock's drooping leaf , and sing, —
Not as of yore, when thou wert here the while,
As knight and leader of the Muses' choir:

The harp of P^rin plays sad discords now,
And we, too, chant a requiem for thee.
O Jubilate! Nay, we'll tune the lyre

To wild rejoicing, and to Wisdom bow!
No fetters bind thy soul on either sea!



MARY JANE PARKHURST, a past
president of Colonel Allen Woman's
Relief Corps, of Gloucester, Mass.,
and prominent member of several
fraternal organizations in that city, is a native
of Cape Ann, and comes of old Essex County
colonial stock. The daughter of Nathaniel
and Martha (Brooks) Lowe, she was born in
Rockport, August 22, 1843. The death of
Mrs. Martha B. Tjowe when Mary was only
two weeks old led to the child's adoption, with-
out change of name, by John Woodward and
Sarah (Stanwood) Lowe, of Gloucester. Ten-
derly and carefully nurtured by her foster-
parents, whose memory she cherishes with
filial affection and gratitude, Mary J. Lowe
grew to maturity amid pleasant surroundings

and under home influences favorable to the
development of sterling qualities of woman-
hood. She was educated at a private school
in Gloucester ami at Abbot Academy, Andover,
Mass., where she was a student, boarding at
Smith Hall, for three years, 1856-58. In her
first year the principal of the academy was
Maria Brown; in her second and third, Enmia
L. Taylor, sister to Samuel Taylor, LL.D., of
Phillips Andover Academy. One of her class-
mates and chums was "Georgie" Stowe (young-
est daughter of the author of " Uncle Tom's
Cabin," then residing in Andover), a slender,
fair-haired, attractive girl, "looking," it was
said, "so much like Eva!" in her mother's
famous story, but whose (assumedly) naive
drolleries rather suggested the character of
Topsy. Another fellow-pupil at the academy
for a short time was Elizabeth Stuart Phelps,
of whom it is remembered that her very early
school-girl compositions, while always pre-
pared with neatness and care, gave no evidence
of unusual literary ability.

On account of the serious illness of her mother,
Mrs. Sarah Stanwood Lowe, Mary left the acad-
emy in 1858, without completing the full course
of study, as she otherwise would have done.
Mrs. Lowe died September 4, 1862. She was
a daughter of Captain Theodore Stanwood, of
Gloucester, and sister to Amelia Stanwood, the
wife of the Rev. Andrew Bigelow, D.D.

John Woodward Lowe, a native of Ipswich,
Mass., was for many years a merchant in
Gloucester and a highly esteemed citizen. He
died in 1867.

On the 22d of March, 1864, Marj' J. Lowe
was married to Charles Edward Parkhurst, son
of Charles and Elizabeth (Andrews) Parkhurst.
Mr. Parkhurst is a prosperous business man of
Gloucester, being a proprietor of marine rail-
ways. He is a member of the Indepenilent
Order of Odd Fellows. Mr. and Mrs. Parkhurst
have one daughter, Mamie Bessie. She was
educated in the public schools of Gloucester,
and in recent years has travelled extensively
with her mother. Mamie B. Paikhurst is a
member of Lucy Knox Chapter, Daughters of
the Revolution.

Mrs. Parkhurst has been a member of Colonel
Allen Relief Corps, No. 77, auxiliary to the



Colonel Allen Post, No. 45, G. A. R., of Glouces-
ter, since December, 1886, when the corps was
organized.

She has held various positions of responsi-
bility in the corps, and in 1894 was elected
president, performing the various duties of
that office with efficiency. The office of de-
partment aide has several times been conferred
upon her by tlepartment presidents; and she
has also been an assistant inspector, serving
in that official capacity in Ipswich, Salem, and
Danvers. In 1899 she was department press
correspondent for the National Tribune. She
has written many articles for the papers. Mrs.
Parkhurst has attended nearly all the State
conventions of the AVoman's Relief Corps during
the past fifteen years, and has served in official
positions antl on committees during the ses-
sions. She has several times been elected a
delegate by the Department of Massachusetts,
W. R. C, to national conventions of the order:
and she was a participant in the national con-
vention held at Indianapolis, Ind., in 1893, at
the one held the following year in Pittsburg,
Pa., also at Louisville, Ky., in 1895, at St.
Paul, Minn., in 1896, and at Chicago, 111., in
1900. In February, 1903, she was elected a
delegate to the national convention in August,
1903, in California. On account of illness she
was unable to attend that convention. Referring
to her patriotic work, she says, "My interest
in the soldiers' cause is unabated."

Mrs. Parkhurst is a charter member of the
Whitney Club, a social organization composed
of members of the Grand Army of the Repub-
lic, Woman's Relief Corps, and other friends,
who journeyed together to the National En-
campment, G. A. R., at Indianapolis in 1893,
ami thence to the World's Fair in Chicago.
Semi-annual reunions of this club have since
been regularly held.

Mrs. Parkhurst is actively interested in fra-
ternal antl charitable objects of the Independent
Order of Odd Fellows, and is a Past Noble
Grand of Sea-shore Lodge, Daughters of Re-
bekah. No. 14, of Gloucester.

The United Order of Independent Odd Ladies
is an organization that has received her hearty
support. She has been elected to all the prin-
cipal offices of the Golden Rod Lodge, No. 35,

of Gloucester, and as a Past Senior represent-
ative is entitled to membership in the State
body. This order is entirely independent, and
not connected with the I. 0. of 0. F., although
its objects are similar. It is one of the oldest
women's societies in New England, having been
instituted at East Boston, July 14, 1845.

Mrs. Parkhurst also has membership in the
Order of Pocahontas and in the Ladies of the
G. A. R. in Salem, Mass. She is also a member
of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
and is in full accord and symjiathy with the
work of this organization.

She has a numerous circle of friends, and en-
tertains many guests at her home, a spacious
dwelling on Middle Street, in a most hospitable
manner.

She is a member of the Congregational church
in Gloucester and of the Abbot Academy Club,
which holds its meetings in Boston. Kind-
hearted, liberal, antl public-spirited, Mrs. Park-
hurst is a worthy representative of loyal New
England womanhood.



HELEN LOUISE GILSON, one of the
noble band of army nurses who min-
istered to the soldiers of the Civil
War in the hospitals and on the battle-
fields of the South, was born in Boston, Novem-
ber 22, 1835, and was educated in the jniblic
schools. Her parents were A.sa, Jr., and Lytlia
(Cutter) Gilson; her paternal grandparents,
Asa, Sr., and Susan (Gragg) Gilson. Her
grandfather Gilson was a native of Groton and
a lineal descendant of Joseph^ Gilson, who was
one of the original proprietors of that town.

Miss Giison's mf&gt;tlier died, a widow, in 1851,
aged fifty-three. She was a daughter of Jona-
than'* and Lydia (Trask) Cutter, of West Cam-
bridge (now Arlington), who were marriefl in
Lexington, September 15, 1788. Jonathan''
Cutter was a descendant of Richard' Cutter, of
Cambridge (through William,^ William,'' and
Jonathan'*). He died in 1813. He was prob-
ably the Jonathan Cutter of Charlestown who
was registered as a private in Captain Harris's
company at different dates in 1775. He died
in 1S13, and his widow in 1818 became the



wife of one of his kinsmen, William Cutter, a
Revolutionary soldier and pensioner.

Helen Loui.se Gilson was graduated from the
Wells School on I^lossom Street in 1852. In
September of that year she entered the Girls'
High and Normal School, one of the first pupils.
She there continued her studies till her appoint-
ment as head assistant to Master James Hovey
of the Phillips School. After teaching five
years she resigned her position on account of
ill health. Subse(|uently she was engaged as
a private teacher for the children of the Hon.
Frank B. Fay, then Mayor of Chelsea. She
was of a deeply religious nature, imbued with
the cheerful faith of I'niversalism, and was a
member of the church in Chelsea, then under
the pastoral charge of the Rev. Charles H.
Leonard, now Dean of Tufts Divinity School.

The breaking out of the Civil War enkindled
her patriotism, and it was through conversa-
tion with Dr. Leonard that she was led to form
the purpose of becoming an army nurse. Her
application to be allowed to .serve in this capac-
ity did not at once meet a favorable response,
Miss Dorothea L. Dix, superintendent of army
nurses, considering her too young to go to the
front. She waited for a time, and directly
after the evacuation of Yorktown Mr. Fay
was prominently connected with the Sanitary
Commission; and, realizing that she would be
a valuai:)le assistant in tliat .service, he secured
her a position on one of the hospital boats.
She went from his house in Chelsea to the war,
and was with Mr. Fay at all the principal battles.
For several months her duties were confined to
these boats, stationed at ilifferent points.

On September 18, 1862, a few hours after the
battle of Antietam, she reached the field, re-
maining on duty tiiere and at Pleasant Valley
until the wounded had been taken to the gen-
eral hospitals. November and December of
the same year found her at work in the camps
and hospitals near Fredericksburg, Va., during
the campaign of General Burnsitle., In the
.spring of 1863 she was there again, being also
at the battle of Chancellorsville and in the
Potomac Creek hospital.

As stated in "Our Army Nurses," a volume
coini)iled by Mary A. Holland, "when the
army moved, she joined it at Manassas; but,

finding that her special diet supplies had been
lost on the passage, she returned to Washing-
ton, and went to Gettysburg, arriving a few
hours after the last day's tiglit. She worked
here until the wounded had all been sent to
Base Hospital. In October, November, and
December, 1863, she worked in the hospitals
on Folly and Morris Islands, South Carolina,
when General Gilmore was besieging Fort
Sumter. Early in 1864 she joined the army
at Brandy Station, and in May went with the
Auxiliary Corps of the Sanitary Connnission
to Fredericksburg, when the battle of the
Wilderness was being fought."

She served in the tent, on the field, or in the
hospitals at Antietani, Fredericksburg, Chan-
cellorsville, and Gettysburg. In the terrible
campaigns of the Wilderness and in all the
other engagements of the Army of the Potomac
in 1864 antl 1865 she labored unceasingly.
She was often under fire and suffered many
hardships, but with unselfish devotion, her only
thought being that of duty.

William Howell Reed, in his book upon
"Hospital Life in the Army of the Potomac,"
has much to say of Miss Gilson and her work,
his first reminiscence being connected with
Fredericksburg: "One afternoon just before
the evacuation, when the atmosphere of our
rooms was close and foul, and all were longing
for a breath of cooler Northern air, while the
men were moaniiig with pain or restless with
fever, and our hearts were sick with pity for
the sufferers, I heard a light step upon the
stairs; and, looking up, I saw a young lady
enter who brought with her such an atmosphere
of calm and cheerful courage, so much fresh-
ness, such an expression of gentle, womanly
sympathy, that her mere presence seemeil to
revive the drooping spirits of the men and to
give them new power of endurance through
their long hours of suffering. First with one,
then at the sitle of another, a friendly word
here, a gentle word and smile there, a tender
sympathy with each prostrate sufferer, a sym-
pathy which could read in his eyes his longing
for home love and for the presence of some
absent one, in those few moments hers was in-
deed an angel ministry. Before she left the
room she sang to them, first some stirring



national melody, then some sweet or plaintive
hymn to strengthen the fainting heart; and I
remember how her notes penetratetl to every
part of the building. Soldiers with less painful
wounds, from the rooms above, began to crowd
out into the entries, and men from below crept
up on their hands and knees, to catch every
note and to receive of the benediction of her
presence, for such it was to them. Then she
went away. I did not know who she was, but
I was as much moved and melted as any sol-
dier of them all."

When the steamer containing the wounded
and the members of the Auxiliary Corps left
Fredericksburg (it being necessary to evacuate
the town) and reached Port Royal, they were
besieged by negroes. They came in such num-
bers and were so earnest in their appeals for
rescue that a government barge was appropri-
ated for their use. Mr. Reed says: "A thou-
santl were stowed upon her decks. They had
an evening .service of prayer and song, and the
members of the corps went on board to witness
it. When their song had ceased. Miss Gilson
addressetl them. She pictured the reality of
freedom, told them what it meant and what
they would have to do. No longer would there
be a master to deal out the peck of corn, no
longer a mistress to care for the old people or
the children. They were to work for them-
selves, provide for their own sick, and support
their own infirm ; but all this was to be done
under new conditions. . . . Then in the simplest
language she explainetl the difference between
their former relations with their master and
their new relations with the Northern people,
showing that labor here was voluntary, and
that they could only expect to secure kind
employers by faithfully doing all they had to
do. She coun.selled them to be truthful, eco-
nomical, unselfish, and to guide their lives by
kindly deeds."

Cold Harbor and City Point were scenes of
Miss Gilson's labors, and then in company with
Mrs. Barlow, wife of General Francis C. Barlow,
she went to the front of Petersburg. They
ministered there to the wounded of the Second
and Eighteenth Army Corps. Afterward for
several months Miss Gilson was at the Base
Hospital at City Point.

"Up to this time," says Mr. Reed, "the
colored troops had taken but a passive part in
the campaign. They were now first brought
into action in front of Petersburg, when tlie
fighting was so desperately contested that many
thousands were left ujjon the field. The
wounded were brought down rapidly to City
Point, where a temporary hospital had been
provifled. It was, however, in no other sense
a hospital than that it was a depot for wounded
men. There were defective management and
chaotic confusion. The men were neglected,
the hospital organization was imperfect, and
the mortality was, in consequence, frightfully
large. Their condition was horrible. The se-
verity of the campaign in a malarious country
had prostrated many with fevers; and typhoid,
in its most malignant forms, was raging with
increasing fatality.

"These stories of suffering reached Miss Gil-
son at a moment when the previous labors of
the campaign had nearly exhausted her strength ;
but her tluty seemed plain. There were no
volunteers for the emergency, and she prepared
to go. Her friends declared that she could
not survive it; but, replying that she could
not die in a cause more sacred, she started out
alone. A hospital hatl to be created, antl this
required all the tact, finesse, and tliplomacy
of which a woman is capable. Official preju-
dice anrl professional pride had to be met and
overcome. A new policy had to be introduced,
and it had to be done without seeming to inter-
fere. Her doctrine and practice always were
instant, cheerful, and silent obedience to medi-
cal and disciplinary ortlers, without any quali-
fication whatever; and by this she overcame
the natural sensitiveness of the medical authori-
ties.

" A hospital kitchen had to be organized
upon the method of special diet; nurses had to
learn her way, and be educated to their duties;
while cleanliness, order, system, had to be en-
forced in the daily routine. Moving quietly
on with her work of renovation, she took the
responsibility of all changes that became neces-
sary; and such harmony prevailed in the camp
that her policy was vindicated as time rolled
on. The rate of mortality was lessened, and
the hospital was now considered the best in



the department. This was accomplished by a
tact and energy which sought no praise, but
modestly veiled themselves behind the orders
of officials. The management of her kitchen
was like tlie ticking of a clock — regular disci-
pline, gentle firmness, and sweet temper always.
The tliet for the men was changed three times
a day, and it was her aim, so far as possible,
to cater to the appetites of indi\adual men.

"Her daily rounds in the wards brought her
into personal intercourse with every patient,
and she knew his special needs. At one time
nine hundred men were supplied from her
kitchen. The nurses looked for Miss Gilson's
word of praise, and labored for it; and she had
only to suggest a variety in the decoration of
the tents to stimulate a most honorable rivalry
among them, which soon opened a wide field
for displaying ingenuity and taste, so that not
only was its standard the highest, but it was
the most cheerfully picturesque hospital at
City Point."

It was more than an ordinary task to take
charge of the colored hospital service, and the
burden was greater than many men could en-
dure. But Miss Gilson was ecfual to the emer-
gency, and gained the love and respect of all
who associated with her. Mr. Reed, who was
a witness of her work, said: "As she passed
through the wards, the men would follow her
witli their eyes, attracted by the grave sweet-
ness of her manner, and when she stopped by
some bedside, and laid her hand upon the fore-
head and smoothed the hair of some soldier,
speaking some cheering, pleasant word, I have
seen the tears gather in his eyes, and his lips
quiver, as he tried to speak or touch the folds
of her dress, as if appealing to her to listen
while he opened his heart about his mother,
wife, or sister, far away.

"And in sadiler trials, when the life of a sol-
dier whom she had watched and ministered to
was trembling in tiie balance between earth and
heaven, she has .seemed, by some special grace
of the Spirit, to reach the living Christ and
draw a blessing down as the shining way was
opened to the tomb. I have seen such looks
of gratitude from weary eyes, now brightened
l^y visions of heavenly glory, the last of many
recognitions of her ministry. Absorbed in her

work, unconscious of the spiritual beauty
which invested her daily life — whether in her
kitchen, in the heat and overcrowtling incident
to the issues of a large special diet list, or sit-
ting at the cot of some poor lonely soldier,
whispering of the higher realities of another
world — she was always the same presence of
grace and love, of peace and benediction.

"I have been with her in the wards where
the men have crave;l some simple religious
service — the reading of Scripture, the repeti-
tion of a psalm, the singing of a hynni, or the
offering of a prayer — and invariably the men
were melted to tears by the touching simplicity
of her eloquence."

In June, 1865, she was performing service in
a hospital at Richmond, \a., and subsequently
she worked with the same earnestness in schools
for white and coloreil people in that city.

Returning to Ma.ssachusetts broken in health,
.she spent some time in a sanitarium. She was
married October 11, 1866, to Hamilton O-sgood.
She died in Newton, Mass., April 20, 1868.
The commemorative services, held in the Uni-
versalist Church in Chelsea on Sumlay, April 26,
were interesting and impressive, and attended
by many friends, including sold rs and other
army associates. Dr. Leonard, in his sermon
from the text, "She hath done what she could,"
spoke of her beautiful life as complete in three
stages — preparation, work, rest. Two hymns —
"Nearer, my God, to Thee," and "Rest'for the
Weary" — were hymns that had been favorites
with Miss Gilson: she had often sung them in
the hospitals.

Among the appreciative words called forth
by her passing were these, dated May 13, 1868,
written by the Rev. Clay MacCauley, who had
been an army chaplain. They are here copied
from the Christian Register: "How well I re-
member her! We first met in I leasant Valley,
Md., October, 1862, soon after the battle of
Antietam. She was then giving the wealth of
her mind and heart to the sick and woundeil
soldiers in an old, cheerless log barn we tried to
call a hospital. What a beautiful minister of
goodness she was! There on that hard thresh-
ing-floor she could be seen constantly, often
sitting beside the sick, speaking tho.se words
of comfort, smiling those sisterly smiles, read-



ing those 'words of life,' singing those songs of
home, country, and heaven, which gave to her
the name, 'Sweet Mi.ss Gilson.' We all loved
her. I am sure she made home dearer, life
purer, and heaven nearer to every one of us.
When, as it happened so often, some spirit
was about to be released from its bonds, she
always took a place beside the dying one and
received the farewell messages. Then, with
her pale, uplifted face, always beautiful, but
never so beautiful as when it lay back looking
into the workl to which she has herself now
gone, .she bore the departing soul by the power
of faith to its rest. They were no false tears
she sheel. They were no false words she spoke.
Never seemed touch more gentle than hers.
Never seemed step so light. It was brightness
at her coming and sadness at her going.

" She was brave as she was loving. I have
seen her sit unmoved and silent in the midst
of a severe cannonade while soldiers were fleeing
for refuge. I have seen her almost alone in
a contraband camp and hospital. In the
midst of ignorance ill-suited to her, vice that
must have been repugnant, and squalor in all
its repulsiveness, she moved, an angel of mercy,
loving and loved. She gave, in all her minis-
trations, health to the diseased, comfort, inspi-
ration to the dying, strength to the timid, knowl-
edge to the ignorant, and to the depraved the
beauty of purity. . . . Her earthly life seemed
but a type of the heavenly."

The author of the following heartfelt tribute,
dated April 22, 1868, here quoted but in part,
wrote from the privilegetl standpoint of long
anil intimate acquaintance.

■' H. L. G.

" To the memory of one whose years, measured by
the sands of time, were few, not so when reckoned
by the value of tlie loyal and royal service she per-
formed.

"The writer knew her well, in the home, in
society, and in the more trying experiences of
the army hospital and the field; and in each
position and in each relation he felt her good-
ness of heart and her greatness of soul. He
loved her for what she has been to those near
and dear to him, for what she has done for

others, and for what she has tried to be to all.
With his family there was no kinship of blood,
but there grew up in those years of association
with them in that home a higher relationship
of reciprocal affection, apjn'cciation, and trust.

"Her thoughtfulness, her gentleness, her dig-
nity, and her playfulness showed the strong
contrasts in her nature, which so singularly
combined the child and the woman. She was
charitable in judgment, ready to forgive those
whose lips had questioned her fidelity or the
purity of her motives, antl ecjually ready to
confess her faults. She often said, true affec-
tion does not make us blind; but, although
keenly alive to the errors of those we love, we
can the more readily pardon. With confidence
in her ability to work in responsible positions,
she was humble, and did not desire notoriety,
declining always to furnish for publication any
history of her army life.

"Her faculty in arranging a hospital, her
tact in managing the patients and the soldier
nurses, her ability to pray and sing with dying
men, to conduct religious and funeral cere-
monies, her adaptation to circumstances, her
courage in hours of danger — all fitted her for
the service she performed. ... In her presence
the profane lip was silent, and she won the re-
spect and love alike of friend and stranger, of
the aged, of whom she was so thoughtful, and
of the young, whom she so readily instructed
and amused.

"Loving her Saviour, she loved the divinity
in our humanity, and believed that all good
thoughts, words, deeds, are divine; that we are
but the channel through which they flow, and
that the divine current is sure to deposit in
our hearts the seeds of constant joy. This was
the only reward she sought." ... — f. b. f.

The monument erected over her grave in
Woodlawn Cemetery, Chelsea, bears this in-
scription : —

On each Memorial Day the monument is
decked with flowers, and an appropriate service
is conducted by the Woman's Relief Corps of

grateful, loving remembrance.



MARY SEARS McHENRY, past Na-
tional President of the Woman's Re-
lief Corps, while a resident of Deni-
son, la., is a native of Berkshire
County, Massachusetts, and comes of old colo-
nial stock. She was born in New Boston vil-
lage, in the town of Sandisfield, December 30,
1834, daughter of David G. and Olive (Deming)
Sears. Her father was son of Paul" and Rachel
(Granger) Sears, of Sandisfield, and a descend-
ant in the seventh generation of Richard Sears
(or Sares, as formerly spelled), of Yarmouth,
Mass., the line being: Richard,' Paul,^ ' Joshua,'
Paul,' " David G.' The name of Richard Sares
was on the tux list of Plymouth Colony in March,
1633. In 1639 he settled with others at a place
on Cape Cod which they named Yarmouth.

His grandson, PauP Sears, of Yarmouth,
married in 1693 Mercy Freeman, daughter of
Thomas'' Freeman and grand-daughter of John
and Mercy (Prence) Freeman, Mercy Prence
being a daughter of Governor Thomas Prence,
of Plymouth Colony, by his wife Patience, who
was a daughter of William Brewster, Elder of
the church of Scrooby, Leyden, and Plymouth.
Patriots, scholars, and philanthropists have
been numbered among the posterity of Richard
Sears of Yarmouth. The late Barnas Sears,
D.D., LL.D., sometime President of Brown
University and afterward superintendent of
the Peabody Educational Fund, was a son of
Paul" Sears and an uncle of Mrs. McHenry.

David G. Sears, after the birth of his daugh-
ter Mary, resided successively in Hartford,
Conn., and in New York City, engaged in mer-
cantile business, and subsequently settled in
Ogle County, Illinois, where he purchased a
section of land and applied himself to farm-
ing. Mary Sears completed her school studies
at the seminary (now college for women) in
Rockford, 111. On the 28th of January, 1864,
she was married to William A. McHenry,

who was orderly Sergeant of Company S,
Eighth Illinois Cavalry, and was then at home
on a veteran's furlough. He continued in the
service of his country, returning to Washington
after his marriage ami rejoining his regiment.
His brother held the office of treasurer of Craw-
ford County, Iowa, and Mrs. McHenry was ap-
pointed his deputy. A\'hen her husband re-
turned from the war, they settled in Denison,
la., where they still make their home. Mr. Mc-
Henry is a banker and a breeder of Angus cattle.
He is interested in the Relief Corps and also in
other patriotic and charitable work in which
his wife is a leader.

He was Department Commander of Iowa
G. A. R., 1886-87, ami represented that order
in San Francisco at the National Encampment,
G. A. R., in 1886. The local camp of Sons of
Veterans bears his name, W. A. McHenry
Camp, S. of v.. No. 53.

In July, 1883, at the convention in Denver,
Col., of all the women's societies in the country
that were working for the Grand Army of the
Republic, Mrs. McHenry was an unauthorized
representative from Iowa. The Denver con-
vention resulted in the organization of the Na-
tional Woman's Relief Corps. Upon Mrs. Mc-
Henry's return to Denison a local corps was
formed under her leadership. She was electetl
President thereof, and was active in the work
throughout the State. After serving in various
other capacities, she was chosen Department
President of Iowa, and later served as Depart-
ment Treasurer. At the convention held in
Tremont Temple, Boston, in July, 1890, Mrs.
McHenry was elected National President, to
succeed Mrs. Annie Wittenmyer. Her admin-
istration was conducteil in an able manner, and
in her travels in several States of the I'nion
she gave such a favorable impression of the
order that many corps and members were aiUled
to its rolls. At the 'next national convention,
in Detroit, Mich., in August, 1891, Mrs. Mc-
Henry gave a detailed and interesting account
of the year's work. "The year has been to
me," she .said, "full of responsibilities hereto-
fore unknown, yet I have enjoyed the work and
found a rare pleasure in the ]ierformance of
varied and oftentimes complicated duties. The
months as I recall them seem but as days, and



the time has flown too quickly for me to ac-
complish all I had hopetl and desiretl to do. . . .
The membership of our order has steadily in-
creased in number ami influence during the
year, antl is represented in every State of the
Union but one — Alabama — and all the Terri-
tories except Indian, Idaho, and Alaska. Even
Canada claims its post and auxiliary corps (Gen-
eral Hancock Post and Corps of Montreal),
which are attached to the Department of Ver-
mont. Three liundretl and sixty-two corps
have been instituted during the year, with a
membership of seven thousand two hundred."

The net gain during the year was reported
as twelve thousand six hundred seventeen mem-
bers, and the total membership as one hundred
seventeen thousand fifty-eight. Referring to
work among the colored people, Mrs. McHenry
stated that there were Relief Corps in Virginia,
the Carolinas, in Florida, Louisiana, Georgia,
Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi, auxiliary
to colored posts. Seven of these were insti-
tuted during the year. "Their ritualistic work
may be imp(&gt;rfect," .she said, "but their zeal and
loyalty are unabated, and they accomplish
much good in their own way among their own
people." Referring to Memorial Day, she
stated that many appeals for this object were
received from the several Department Com-
manders within whose jurisdiction were located
national cemeteries with their tens of thousands
of Union soldiers. She ackncnvledged the liberal
tlonations of corps in tlepartments where com-
ratles sufferetl from severe drought during the
past season.

A part of her address relatetl to the National
Woman's Relief Corps Home, of which she
spoke in congratulatory terms, as follows : " This
first year in the history of our National W. R. C.
Home has been one of unwonted prosperity
and success. The sympathy and co-operation
of the people have been expressed in every
po.ssible manner, and their gifts for its equip-
ment and support have been generous even to
lavishness. ... A most princely gift is the ap-
propriation by the Ohio Legislature of twenty-
five thousand dollars for the erection of a cot--
tage upon the home grounds. We asked for
twenty-five hundretl dollars, and the State
gave us twenty-five thousand dollars. This is



74



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



the highest recognition of the Woman's Relief
Corps and its work that has ever been given,
and is truly a crown of glory to this adminis-
tration and the seal of future possibilities."
Quoting from the report of the Invalid Pension
Committee of Congress, to whom the bill for
pensions for army nurses had been referred, she
continued : " I trust the work of securing special
pensions will he pushed to the utmost. The
greatest obstacle in the way seems to be the
defective record of army nurses in the War
Department. Twenty-six thousand names of
women are enrolled. Eighteen thousand of
them have no record whatever. Six thousand
two hundred and. eighty-one are mentioned as
army nurses, but four thousand six hundred
and ninety-four of these have no statement as
to the authority by which they were appointed.
It is not probable that Congress will pass a
general pension law for army nurses until a
satisfactory record is made. Therefore I be-
lieve it is of the utmost importance that this
record of the W\ar Department be corrected
and, if possible, completed. This will require
a vast amount of time, patience, work, and in-
fluence, an immense correspondence, and some
money. But the women who served their
country amid the i)erils of war deserve some-
thing at our hands; and, if we cannot secure
for them pensions while living, let us build for
them a monument of tleeds, recorded in the
military register of the nation. Many, very
many of them are dead. All will soon be gone.
Then let us not allow their heroic services to
sink into oblivion, but take immediate action
toward the accomplishment of this work."

In closing her address, Mrs. McHenry pre-
sented several recommendations of value to
the work, and expressed thanks to many friends
for courtesies received.

On motion of Mrs. Kate B. Sherwood, past
National President, the convention extended
thanks to Mrs. McHenry "for her exemplifi-
cation of all the womanly qualities enjoined
by the obligations of our order while presiding
over this convention." Mrs. McHenry re-
sponded: "Ladies, I thank you. Time is too
precious for me to use it in telling of my ap-
preciation of all the kind things you have said
and done for me, not only here in convention.



but during the whole year. I trust the friend-
ships thus formed will grow warmer as our years
increase. Parting is the one 'sweet sorrow' of
our conventions; but, as I claim you all as 'my
daughters,' I trust each one will remember me
with the same fraternal love I bear you, and
in that lovely 'somewhere' we shall all meet
to 'go out no more forever.' "

Mrs. McHenry has continued her active inter-
est in the work of the National Woman's Relief
Corps, and has been a liberal contributor to
various charities, expending her money freely
for benevolent objects. Enjoying the cjuiet of
her home life, she is interested in public work
only for the good she can accomplish. Mr. and
Mrs. McHenry have four children, two sons and
two daughters, who are perpetuating the prin-
ciples of patriotism by membership in the so-
cieties of S. of v., W. R. C, and Sons and
Daughters of the Revolution.



LOUISE C. PURINGTON, M.D., Na-
tional Superintendent W. C. T. U..
__J Department Health and Heredity. —
Mary Louise Chamberlain, as Dr. Pur-
ington was christened, was born near Madison,
N.Y., in one of the lovely hamlets, or "hol-
lows," of the Empire State. The youngest
child of Isaac and Harriet (Putnam) Chamber-
lain, she traces her descent through her mother
from the Putnam family of Danvers, originally
known as Salem Village, Mass.

The immigrant progenitor of this family,
John Putnam, died in 1662, some twenty years
or more after his arrival in the colony. Three
sons of John' handed down the family name.
They were: Thomas,^ grandfather of General
Israel Putnam; NathanieP; ami John, Jr.,^ who
fought in King Philip's War, and was aftex-
ward a Captain of militia. Elcazer' Putnam,
born in 1665, seventh child of Captain John^
and his wife, Rebecca Prince, was a deacon of
the church in Danvers. The farm on which he
settled lies north of the General Israel Putnam
house. Henry* Putnam, born in 1712, son of
Deacon Eleazer^ and his second wife, Eliza-
beth, dauglder of Benjamin and Apphia (Hale)
Rolfe, of Newbury, removed in middle life
from Danvers to "Charlestown, where he kept

school, and thence about the year 1763, it is
thought, removed to Medford. A stanch pa-
triot, seizing his gun on the ahirm of April 19,
1775, he set forth to meet the foe, anil was
killed at the battle of Lexington, being then
in his sixty-fourth year. He was Dr. Puring-
ton's great-great-grandfather. Eleazer^ Put-
nam, born in Danvers in 1738, son of Henry^
and his wife Hannah, was a farmer, and resided
in Medford. In April, 1775, he served five
days as a private in Captain Isaac Hall's com-
pany.

Dr. Elijah" Putnam, Dr. Purington's maternal
grandfather, son of Eleazer'' and Mary (Crosby)
Putnam, was born in Medford, Mass., in 1769.
He died in January, 1S51, in Madison, N.Y.,
where he had practised medicine many j-ears.
His wife was Phebe, daughter of Captain Abner
Ward. They had ten children — Frances, John,
Phebe, Samuel and Sidne&gt;y (twins), Hamilton,
Harriet (Mrs. Chamberlain), Mary (Mrs. Adin
Howard), Caroline, and Henry Locke. Two
of the sons were physicians.

Dr. Purington was early orphaned, and owes
her liberal education to her aunt Mary and
uncle Adin Howard, who, with rare philan-
thropy, adopted seven children. From the
beautiful village home of the Howards at
Madison, N.Y., Louise, a child of twelve years,
was sent to the Utica Academy. At nineteen
she was graduated from Mount Holyoke Semi-
nary and ten years later from the Hahnemann
Medical College, Chicago, supplementing the
course with advanced study and clinical ex-
perience in the hospitals and dispensaries of
New York City. It was the same bent that
led the young girl, just out of school, to offer
herself as a hospital nurse in the service of the
United States Christian Commission. George
H. Stuart, of Philadelphia, was at the head of
the department, and had given to each member
of the class of 1864 at Mount Holyoke, in which
she was graduated, a silver pin, appropriately
inscribed, in recognition of their self-ilenying
gift of money — the price of the customary class
badge — to the work of the c(;mmission.

At the Hahnemann College Dr. Purington
took first rank, with one other stutlent leading
her large class, its only woman graduate. A
powerful motive prompting her to this study,



at a time when the world looked askance at
the woman tloctor, was her cherished belief in
the ecjuality of the .sexes and her desire to see
women not only entering every open door, but
pushing open those that stood ajar. One who
vividly remembers the graduating exercises of
her class and the applause that greeted the one
woman, young, beautiful, and poised, .who rose
to receive her diploma, says of that bit of his-
tory, " It set forward perceptibly the woman's
hour." It by no means closed Dr. Purington's
student life. Her scholarly habits were formed
and crystallized in life and character. A signal
.service rendered to her sex, which resultetl in
preventing Halmemaim College from taking the
backwanl step of excluding women from its
courses, brought her into close relation and
finally intimate friendship with Mrs. Kate N.
Doggett, a social and intellectual leader in
Chicago, the founder and promoter of the
Fortnightly, one of the leading literary clubs
of women in America. Dr. Purington served
as chairman of its classical committee, and
wrote several scholarly papers.

But literary and professional interests could
not long suffice a spirit touched to finer issues.
The temperance crusade reached Chicago.
Frances E. Willard came in from Evanston to
arldress a mass meeting. The young doctor
heard her ringing words, respondetl to the
bugle-eall of spirit to spirit, sought her leader-
ship, and became her co-worker and lifelong
friend. The association of that year with the
great leader of temperance reform was invalu-
able to Dr. Purington, opening new perspec-
tives for an as])iring nature. She regards Miss
Willard's influence as among the dominant
forces in her life, and especially owes to it her
ultimate devotion to the temperance cause.
An immediate result was the formation of the
first "Y," or Young Woman's Christian Tem-
perance LTnion, at her home in Chicago.

In the mission field, also, Dr. Purington
specialized in young women's work. As an
active member for twelve years of the Woman's
Board of Missions of the Interior, she originated
and carried forward the young ladies' work.
She was playfully called " Bi.'ihop of the Girls
of the Interior" and popularly known as "En-
gineer of the Bridge," an ingenious device in



76



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



mission work by which she aroused enthusiasm
and secured unity of action in the societies
she formed. Her interest in foreign missions
can be traced to a favorite teacher at Mount
Holyoke. To that teacher, Ann Eliza Fritcher,
afterward a missionary under the American
Board, founder and long-time principal of the
Girls' School at Marsovaii, Turkey, Dr. Puring-
ton feels the deepest spiritual obligation.

Life, almost all life, has its tragic side. This
one was not exempt. A nervous breakdown
came, the consequence of anxiety and over-
work; and for two years or more there was a
physical, mental, and spiritual " walk in the
dark with God." The (lisability had its com-
pensations in a long residence at Clifton Springs
Sanitarium and the help and blessing of Dr.
Henry Foster. Out of pathos unspeakable,
disaster, and defeat, came a knowledge of things
unseen and eternal, and a buoyant faith in God
that has been the mightiest factor in Dr. Pur-
ington's spiritual life. A gradual restoration
was followed by change of scene and surround-
ings and a new home in the serener atmosphere
of Boston. With Miss P'dla Gilbert Ives, the
friend who is one with her in motive, interest,
and aim. Dr. Purington has been associated
since 1885 in a school for girls, at the same
time giving herself without stint to philan-
thropic work. For ten years she has held an
influential position in the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, nmning the gamut of
local and county president, local. State, and
national superintendent, and of late editor of
the State paper. She served several years as
national superintendent of franchise, and com-
piled for Miss Willard the facts used by her in
her annual addresses to exhibit the progress
of women. In 1895 Dr. Purington was trans-
ferred to the department of health antl he-
redity, which, as national superintendent, she
has thoroughly organized and developed, rally-
ing to her a,ssistance State superintendents and
a host of earnest workers in her great con-
stituency.

The aim of her department is the develop-
ment of the highest life, physical, mental, and
spiritual, and not only this, but also the clean-
est, healthiest civic life. It includes co-opera-
tion with boards of health in the enforcement



of health ordinances; school hygiene and sani-
tation, instruction in the laws of health in re-
lation to dress, food, air, exercise, cleanliness,
mental and moral hygiene. The department
is active in trying to secure the passage of pure
food bills, legislative enactments relating to
public health, milk and poultry inspection, etc.,
all of which work covers a wide field of en-
deavor, and is attended year by year with in-
creasingly good results.

In 1903, at the World's Convention of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union in
Geneva, Switzerland, Dr. Purington was ap-
pointed World's Suijerintendcnt of the depart-
ment co-operation with missionary societies;
thus being enabled to unify her life-long work
in two great Jields of Christian activity.

In both missionary and temperance lines Dr.
Purington's contributions to leading periodicals,
her manuals and leaflets, have won recognition
and hearty praise. Especially valuable arc
her life studies in the field of health and hered-
ity. Her character and literary style are for- ^-
ful, original, and clear-cut. She says o icr-
self, '"The open secret of my life is the same
as Charles Kingsley's: I have a friend, not only
the One above all others, but in the sweetest
human sense, as interpreted by Jeremy Taylor:
' By friendship I suppose you mean the greatest
love, and the greatest usefulness, and the most
open communication, and the noblest suffer-
ings, and the most exemplary faithfulness, and
the severest truth, and the heartiest coun.sels,
and the greatest union of minds of which brave
men and women are capable.' " Her intellectual
awakening she tlates from the early beginning
of this friendship, which has been to her a chief
source of happiness as well as of stimulus to
growth. She believes with Evelyn, "There is
in friendship something of all relations and
something above them all."



ALICE KENT ROBERTSON, now
/ \ known in private life as Mrs. Truman
X JL IjPP (iuimby, is the only child of the
Hon. William Henry and Rebecca
(Prentiss) Kent, late of Charlestown, both de-
ceased.
Alice Kent was born on Staniford Street,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



77



Boston, October 16, 1S53, when the old West
End was the residence of some of the leading
citizens. A few years later the Kent faniilj'
moved to Belmont, Mass., and thence to
Charlestown, where, in the olil and spacious
house, 25 Monument Square, the daughter still
lives with her present husbatnl, Truman Lee
Quimby, to whom she was marrietl November
21, 1901.

Her education was acquired in private schools,
the one from which she was graduated having
been Miss Catherine Will^y's, afterward Miss
Ellen Hubbard's, at 52 Bowdoin Street, Boston.

From her early childhood Alice Kent's love
for reading and recitation was pronounced, and
this taste was carefully nurtvu'(Ml during the
last three years of her school life by her teacher
in literature, the late Theodore Weld. His en-
thusiasm for the study of Shakespeare he was
.successful in transmitting to his pupils, being
especially so in her case. She first appeared
on the amateur stage in Boston in 1871, taking
the role of Lady \'iola Harleigh in " Dreams of
Delusion," and showed unusual promise for
a girl of eighteen. The part of Sir Bernard
Harleigh was played by George Riddle.

Some time afterward Miss Sarah Starr (aunt
of the renowned Starr King), a woman of
marked individuality and culture, and pos-
sessed of discriminating literary taste, urged
her young friend Alice Kent to interest herself
in Robert Browning. The poet was then gen-
erally consideretl too obscure for comprehen-
sion, and was not widely read in this countr}'.
Miss Starr, who was an ardent admirer of
lirowning, little thought that this suggestion
would, after her death, be so richly fruitful.
The inunediate result was the i)urchase of
two second-hand volumes of Browning, which
the girl read with lukewarm interest from time
to time.

Alice Kent was married in Charlestown, in
1879, to William Duncan Robertson, M.D.,
and until his death, in 1883, resided with him
at Stanstead, P.Q., returning then to the
Charlestown home of lier j^arents. The mar-
riage was without issue.

In the years directly following, Mrs. Robert-
son carried on by herself a serious study oi
Browning, so that when the Boston Browning



Society was formed in 1885 she was ready to
take great interest in its work. At one of the
early meetings her interpretation of "James
Lee's Wife" was received with marked favor,
being the forerunner of her later success in this
line. Until 1889 Mrs. Robertson's work was
in ever-increasing demand, and she read en-
tirely for charity on numberless occasions.

In 1890 she made a tleparture in her work
by giving a subscription course of readings
from Shakespeare and Browning in Boston
drawing-rooms. Her immediate success war-
rantetl her continuance, and she appeared before
many wonien's clubs in and about Boston until
1897, when, on January 20, she gave her first
public reading at the Christian Association
Hall, Boston.

During Mrs. Robertson's school-days Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe started a girls' club in the
Back Bay district, Boston, to meet Saturtlay
mornings to read and discuss literature, with
the idea of fostering the literary passion which
her youngest daughter and her friends had
acquired at school. This Saturday Morning
Club gave occasional theatricals for charity,
and in a production of Tennyson's "Princess,"
in May, 1885, Mrs. Robertson for the first time
essayed a man's part, playing the Prince with
much skill. At another time the club pro-
duced Browning's "In a Balcony" in Charles
Adams's little hall on Tremont Street, ^\vs.
Robertson taking the part of the Qu^en. Th.is
proved so successful that by urgent request
the performance was repeated in New Yoi'k,
for charity, at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre.
Mrs. Robertson has played the t^ueen manj^
times. Mr. Edward H. Clement, editor-in-
chief of the Boston Evening Transcript, says
of her in an editorial, April 3, 1897: "To judge
only by her truly thrilling performance — at
once graceful and tender and overw'helmingly
powerful — of the Queen in Browning's Balcony,
if Mrs. Robertson should go upon the profes-
sional stage and play the great tragic roles,
the Saturday Morning Club would gain perma-
nent fame as the Alma Mater of the finest
genius of tragedy since Ristori."

The next noteworthy performance of this
club was the Sophocles "Antigone," with Mrs.
Robertson as Creon the King. The play was



78



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



given at Bumstead Hall, Boston, March, 1890,
and was a great artistic success. In the diffi-
cult nMe of Creon, Mrs. Robertson showed the
possibilities that were later to win her fame in
the "Winter's Tale," which was given in Feb-
ruary, 1895. The extraordinary interest awak-
ened by this performance will not soon be for-
gotten. Historically it was absolutely correct,
dramatically it was a revelation. Boston was
familiar with the play only through Mary
Anderson's production of it during her last visit
here. Her Leontes was a man of no great
dramatic power, who.se work was mediocre and
colorless. Mrs. Robertson had fairly to create
the part. The Boston Transcript referred as
follows to hei' undertaking: "To conciuer Le-
ontes with tone and dress and stride and man-
ner is, to begin with, an apparently impossible
task, but it was accomplished.

" ' The king himself has followed her
"VVTieii she has walked before.'

Then to win sympathy to the mea.sure of the
dramatist's desire for the tyrant who doomed
fair Hermione to death is a trial for kn actor.
Mrs. Robertson has added to the capabilities
revealed in Creon, and shows a depth of pas-
sion and power of uncjualified merit. Criti-
cism of her work must mean chiefly an attempt
at appreciation."

Henry A. Cla))p, dramatic critic of the Bos-
ton Daily Advertiser, in the issue of January
21, IS97, says- "Mrs. Robertson has a fine
stage presence, an earnest, dignifietl, antl un-
affected manner, and a noble voice, the reach
and symi)athetic adaptai)ility of which are re-
markable, the range being from a great depth
of note, with the quality of a profound mascu-
line bass, up to a fair me?zo-soprai\o altitude.
Her enunciation is excellent, and her pronun-
ciati(m very near perfection, both having the
constant mark of cultivation. Thus richly
furnished with the tools of her art, Mrs. Robert-
son's performance demonstrated (what her
friends have claimed for her) that her powerful
and clear intelligence, pure taste, soimd judg-
ment, and dramatic sensibility would bring her
great natural gifts to noble results. Her read-
ing of the balcony scene from ' Romeo and
Juliet' put it once niore where it belongs — in



the Garden of Eden before the fall. Mrs.
Robertson's interpretation of Arlo Bates's 'The
Sorrow of Rohab' is to be singled out for ex-
ceptional praise. Its heroic aspects were shown
\\ith full fire and potency, and its love lyrics
were so given that their excjuisite nmsic seemed
to proceed from an accomplished singer, ac-
companied by an orchestra, rather than from
a mere reader using the reatler's tones. Many
of the audience will find the repetitions of
'Sweetheart, sweetheart,' as strains of pas-
sionate music which shall long haunt the mem-
ory and surge up from it to stir the heart. The
best word yet remains to be said: Mrs. Robert-
son practises none of the teasing and trivial
trick(&gt;ries of vocal gymnastics which are the
ojjprobria of vulgar elocutionism ; she eschews
superelaboration and over-accent, which clog
the wheels of the great authors. In short, her
reading is a triumph of intelligence and sym-
pathy skilfully applied to great natural gifts.

"To fully appreciate the depth arul power
of Mrs. Robertson's work it nmst be borne in
mind that she has never receiAcd any instruc-
tion in .so-called elocution. To be sure, in
the Saturday Morning Club performances she,
with the others, was coached by Mr. Franklin
Haven Saigent, of New Yoik, and she grate-
fullj' acknowledges deep indebtedness to the
late William H. Ladd, of Chauncy Hall School,
for criticism of .some of her Shakespeare read-
ings: but. in the large, it may truthfully be
said that she is self-taught. This very lack
of conventional training it is which gives to
her work the delightful freshness and originality
for which it is remarkalile. Moreover, Mrs.
Robertson has not only the voice and personal-
ity to help her in her work, but also the sym-
pathy and the intellectual (jnalities which
worthy inter|)retation of great poets like Brown-
ing, Tennyson, and Shakespeare demands. Her
fervor has been compared to Fanny Kemble's,
and her power of carrying her audience with

"Paolo and Francesca," and the French Cana-
dian dialect poems of Henry Druiiirnond.



MARIE DEWING FAELTEN, one
of the foremost of the young piano
teachers of Boston, was born in
.San Francisco, Cal., April 26, 1869,
being the eldest child of the Rev. Charles Shum-
way and Louie E. (Collins) Dewing. Her father
was born in Pennsylvania, his parents, Ed-
ward and Susan Dewing, having removed to
that State from their old home in Salisbury,
Conn. The Rev. Charles S. Dewing was for
a number of years a teacher of Hebrew anil
Greek in Princeton College, of which he was
a gratiuate. Later he became a Presbyterian
minister, and preached in the West. He came
to Massachusetts in 1&lt;S,S6. He established a
church in Sonierville, which became self-sus-
taining before he left to accept the broader
duties of minister at large. Afterward he
established churches in Brookline, Brockton,
Hyde Park, Haverhill, Waltham, and Spring-
field. Mrs. Dewing, who survives her hus-
band, is now living in Boston. She was born
in Washington, D.C. Her parents were James
and Catherine (Osborn) Hoagland, natives of
New Jersey and descendants of early settlers.
Mr. Hoagland lost his life while on duty in the
United States war-ship "San Jacinto" in Chi-
nese waters some time in the fifties of last cen-
tury. Mrs. Hoagland afterward married C. E
Collins, of California, and her little daughter,
legally adopted by him, became Louie E. Col-
lins. Colonel James Osborn, the father of
Catherine (Mrs. Hoagland), and his brother.
Colonel Abraham, native-born residents of
the old Osborn homestead near Manasquan,
Monmouth County, N.J., were officers of the
American army in the War of 1812, serving
with honor. Their father, Samuel Osborn,
fought in the Revolution. He was taken pris-
oner, but made his escape, with a neighbor
named Allen. His farm was seven times raideil
by the Briti.sh.

The earliest bearer of this surname in New
England was probably Thomas Osborn, who
in 1635 was at Hingliam, Mass., whence he
removed to Connecticut. In 1649-50 he was



one of the founders of East Hampton, L.I.
His sons Joseph ami Jeremy settled in Eliza-
beth, N.J.

A similar name is that of William Fitz Os-
bern, that is, William son of Osbern (spelled
with an e), who went to England in 1066 with
William the Conqueror and after the battle
of Hastings was made Earl of Hereford.

At the age of eight years Marie Dewing began
her musical education under Miss A. L. Benson
in Binghamton, N.Y., and later continued her
studies at Tuscarora Academy in Peimsyl-
vania. After the removal of her parents to
Boston in 1886, she entered the New England
Conservatory of Music, taking up her studies
under Mr. Carl Faelten, and graduating in
1890, while he was director of the Conserva-
tory. In the fall of the same year she became
one of the teachers in pianoforte and hand
culture and superintendent of the normal de-
partment. During this period she introduced
the fundamental training course in the chil-
dren's classes and established a children's
matinee. Weekly lectures upon pedagogi-
cal subjects to teachers in the normal depart-
ment also became a regular feature through
her efforts. In the meantime she was organ-
ist at her father's church in Sonierville, taking
charge of musical affairs and giving her hearty
support to all church work.

During the season of 1894 she met Mr. Rein-
hold Faelten, brother of the director and a
teacher in the Conservatory. On June 23,

1896, they were married, both remaining on
the staff of Conservatory teachers for another
season, when they resigned to associate them-
selves with Mr. Carl Faelten in the Faelten
Pianoforte School, which he established in

1897, after resigning his directorship in the
Conservatory, at the close of seven successful
years. The Faelten Pianoforte School, to the
work of which both Mr. and Mrs. Faelten have
devoted themselves assitluously, soon outgrew
its quarters on Boylston Street, and now occu-
pies a complete floor in the new Huntington
Chambers. Its steady growth proves the merits
of the principles. on which it is reared. Cla.ss
work is a feature of the school. The pupils
are assembled in large class-rooms, with sev-
eral pianos in each, and are tlrilied in the prin-



80

ciples of music, including sight playing, key-
board, written harmon'y, touch, and technique.
The piano lessons proper are given privately
or in small classes of from two to four students.

A pupil studying at the Faelten Pianoforte
School finishes his course a well-roundetl mu-
sician, not only skilled in technique, but with
an understanding of the great masters, great
compositions, and musical history, which gives
him a right to claim to be thoroughly educated
in music. This instruction week by week is
the best thing to supi)ly that musical atmos-
phere which makes the German conservatories
so valuable to students of music. One feels
that Mr. Faelten has surrounded his pupils
with a musical spirit which is a stimulus to
growth; and their public recitals prove that
"concentrated attention, positive knowledge,
intelligent ear, reliable memory, fluency in
sight reading, and artistic ])ianoforte playing
are developed simultaneously."

Mrs. Faelten with her original ideas, cheer-
ful nature, and love of music, although yet a
young woman, has made a place for herself
in the foremost rank of nmsic teachers. Her
teaching and playing are an inspiration to both
pupil and audience. She has a large circle
of frientls in both the social anil musical world,
anfl is much sought after outside of her pro-
fession.



y^NNIE GERTRUDE MURRAY, presi-
ZA dent, 1901-1902, of the New England
X .\. Woman's Press Association, is a Bos-
tonian by birth and education. Her
father, William Devine, who died in 1878, was
one of Boston's pioneer dealers in North River
flagging stone. Mrs. Murray resides with her
mother, at the old homestead 525 East Fifth
Street, South Boston. Her brothers are:
John A. and James V., engaged in the real
estate business in South Boston and Dorchester;
and William H., who is a popular medical
practitioner in South Boston; Dr. Devine, late
Lieutenant Colonel of the Second Massachu-
setts Brigade, who served in the Spanish-
American War.

In 1890 Annie G. Devine became the wife of
George F. H. Murray, who bears the title of



Major, won by services in the Spanish-American
War.

Educated in Notre Dame Convent, Roxbury,
Mass., Mrs. Murray early showed a talent for
literary composition, her stories appearing in
the early eighties in various magazines and
papers under the nom de plume "Annetta."

In late years articles from Mrs. Murray's
pen — stories, sketches, and poems, have ap-
peared in the Boston Transcript, Herald,
Traveler, Post, the Pilot, the National and
Donahoe's Magazine, and many out of town
papers and other magazines. Mrs. Murra}' has
composed many songs.

In 1901 Mrs. Murray was unanimously chosen
to serve as president of one of the leading asso-
ciations of women in New England — namely,
the New England Woman's Press Association,
which was formed in 1885 and incorporated in
1890. Its object is "to jiromote acfjuaintance
and good fellowship among newspaper women,
and to forward by concerted action, through
the press, such good objects in .social, philan-
thropic, and reformatory lines as may from
time to time present themselves." During its
existence of eighteen years this association has
given receptions to many distinguished people.
The "gentlemen's nights," held each year in Feb-
ruary, have been notable affairs. A journalists'
fund gives aid to "distressed newspaper people,
in need of temporary help, whether in or out of
the a.ssociation." The two years under Mrs.
Murray's administration were years of added
prosperity and harmony. The N. E. W. P. A.
is a member of the National Federation of
Women's Clubs and of the Boston Committee
of Council and Co-operation of the State Fed-
eration. Its honorary members are Julia Ward
Howe, Margaret Deland, Louise Chandler Moul-
ton, Harriet Prescott Spofford, Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps Ward, Mary A. Livermore, and Ednah
D. Cheney.

Mrs. Murray was appointed by Mayor Quincy
anil re-appointed by Ma3'or Hart as one of the
Trustees of the Children's Institutions of Suf-
folk Coimty. This position, an unpaid one,
makes steady demand upon tim(&gt; and attention,
embracing as it does the care of fourteen hun-
dred wards in the several divisions of the Chil-
dren's Department.

ing Society, the Boston Business League, and
the Boston Women's Press Club.



BERTHA VELLA BORDEN, a recog-
nized and efficient leader in Sunday-
school work, for nine years previous to
her marriage the Primary Secretary
of the Massachusetts Interdenominational Sun-
day-school Association, is a native of Lynn,
being the eldest of the five children born to
Joseph Franklin and Emma Frances Vella,
both natives of this State.

Her father, Joseph Franklin Vella, of Eng-
lish and French descent, died in 1899. He
was known throughout the city of Lynn as
a business man of sterling integrity, great-
heartedness, faithfulness, and charity, being
a thorough Christian gentleman.

Her mother, Mrs. Ennna Frances Vella, of
English and Scotch descent, a woman of en-
ergy, kindliness, and piety, is still living in
Lynn.

In 1877, after completing her course of study
in the excellent public schools of Lynn, Bertha
Vella entered upon a thorough training for the
work of a teacher in the State Normal School
at Salem. Here she displayed such unusual
aptness for object teaching that, although the
youngest member of her class, she was chosen
by her instructor to represent that part of the
graduation exercises in June, 1879.

Two years of successful teaching followed
in historic, classic Concord, and then, to the
great regret of the Concord School Board, she
accepted an appointment to teach in her home
city, where later she became the honored and
beloved principal of one of its largest primary
schools, and developed remarkable tact in
controlling and interesting the children under
her care.

It was in the Sunday-school connected with
the- Lynn Common Methodist Episcopal Church
that she had begun her work as a teacher at
the age of fifteen, at the age of sixteen being
elected superintendent of its Primary Depart-
ment. She resigned this position when in
Concord, but after she returned to Lynn was



annually re-elected until her resignation at
the close of 1900. She reorganizetl this de-
partment into Kindergarten, Primary, and
Junior Departments, and supervised the teach-
ing of the two hundred and forty-five jjupils.

Richly endowed with strong intellectual
powers, possessed of ileep religious experience
and remarkable teaching abilities, while thus
earnestly devoting herself to her 'duties in
Sunday-school and day school she was, un-
consciously, fitting herself for a wider field of
usefulness. In 1892 she received a call which
appealed to her as a divine vocation, not to be
resisted. She accordingly resigned her posi-
tion as principal of the Lynn Primary School,
and under the direction of Mr. William N.
Hartshorn, of Boston, recently elected chair-
man of the International Executive Commit-
tee of Sunday-school Work, became the Pri-
mary Secretary of the Massachusetts Inter-
denominational Sunday-school Association,
being the first woman in the L'nited States
elected as an acting State Primary Secretary.

In this office Miss Vella displayed good abil-
ities as a public speaker, clearness antl help-
fulness as a writer, antl genius as an organizer.
In her public addresses she aroused, capti-
vated, and held her audiences, often stirring
them to profound gratitude toward Gotl for
his love, antl sincere determinations to utilize
to the best of their abilities their opportuni-
ties to teach his truths to their children. Her
influence over children she taught seemed irre-
sistible. The irrepressible were checked, the
listless aroused, all became absorbed in her
words and spiritual pictures. She made the
Bible ta the little ones a perfect delight; to
their seniors, a new revelation from God; to
all, the love of Christ a living reality and the
desire to serve him controlling.

She was a potent factor in organizing the
evangelical Sunday-schools of Massachusetts
into district associations that hold annual con-
ventions and other gatherings, unifying, har-
monizing, and intensifying all the vital inter-
ests of the Sunday-schools of Massachusetts.
She also organized and supervised the work
of thirty-five primary teachers' unions, taught
weekly the Boston Primary Union, and super-
intended her own primary Sunday-school in



82



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



the historic Lynn Common Methodist Episco-
pal Church.

In addition to her work in Massachusetts,
she gave great impetus to the Sunday-school
cause by her addresses at annual State con-
ventions in all the New England States, at
primary teachers' institutes in the New Eng-
land and Central States, at the annual Pro-
vincial conventions of Montreal, Quebec, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick, and the Inter-
national Conventions held at St. Louis in 1893,
at Boston in 1896, at Atlanta in 1899, and at
the AVorld's Convention held at London, Eng-
land, in 1898. At St. Louis in 1893 Mrs. Borden
was elected Secretary of the International
Primary Department, but refused to accept
re-election at Boston in 1896, because of greatly
increased calls for addresses and correspond-
ence in the State work. She was elected Vice-
President of the International Primary De-
partment, and re-elected in 1899. Meanwhile
she kept busy a ready pen, being a frequent
and highly valued correspondent of the 821.11-
day-school Times, the International Evangel,
the Su7iday-school Journal, and other periodi-
cals. She is also the author of several popular
Sunday-school concert exercises and of two
books, "Song and Study for God's Little Ones"
and "Bible Study Songs." These books are
a veritable storehou.se of good things, from
which primary teachers, leaders of mission
bands and of other children's gatherings, may
obtain helpful Bible exercises and suitable
songs.

At the close of 1900 Miss Vella resigned her
position as State Primary Secretary of Massa-
chusetts, and soon after she was married to
Mr. Charles F. Borden, a merchant of Fall
River. Mr. Borden is a member of the State
Board of the Young Men's Christian A.ssocia-
tion and president of the Fall River District
for Sunday-school work.

Since her marriage Mrs. Borden has lost
none of her interest in the forward movements
of the Sunday-school cause. Amid the many
duties of her home life she finds time to dis-
charge with great efficiency the superintend-
ency of the Junior Department of the Central
Congregational Bible School in Fall River, to
serve as a wise and energetic member of the



District Executive Committee, anil as presi-
dent of the Fall River Primary and Junior
Sunday-school Teachers' Union. The follow-
ing extract from resolutions adapted unani-
mously by the Executive Committee of the
Massachusetts Sunday-school Association show
the high appreciation felt for Mrs. Borden and
her work. This Executive Committee is com-
posed of leading Massachusetts Sunday-school
workers, and represents one thousand nine
hundred and nineteen Sunday-schools and
three hundred and forty-five thousand one
hundred and thirty-three Bible students.

" She has organized the primary teachers
into associations for mutual and helpful in-
tercourse and for the interchange of plans and
purposes in department effort, and has, by
her lesson studies, her literary work, her song-
books — that have effectively touched many
young lives — and her spirit of devotion and
unselfishness and her exalted Christian char-
acter, lifted the Primary Department to a high
plane of active and useful living; and she has
awakened a new and abiding interest in the
general work as represented by the State As-
sociation.

" Her influence in the work for the children
has not been confined to our own State, but
has extended far beyond our borders, reach-
ing all parts of our country. The wealth of
her resources, her ripe experience, and her sym-
pathy have been freely and generously dis-
tributed where the most good could be ac-
complished. We extend to her our best wishes
for the future, and pray that God's choicest
blessings may ever attend her and her work."



ELIZA BUCKMAN CAHILL, M.D., was
born February 22, 1862, in Woburn,
Mass., being the (laughter of Leander
and Ruth M. (Buckma;i) Cahill. Her
father, Leander, and her jiaternal grandfather,
Barnaval Cahill, were natives of Sackvillc, Cum-
berland County, New Brunswick, Canada, and
belonged to one of the oldest and most widely
known families in that country. Barnavnl
Cahill, born in 1804, was the son of John R.
Cahill and grandson of John Cahill, a native of
Ireland, who married Teresa Barnaval, an

English wonuiii, and lived in London, England,
engaged in business as a merchant and ship-
owner.

Dr. Cahill's great-grandfather, John R. Cahill,
died in Sackville in 1852. He was born in
London, England, in 1777. His father, decid-
ing to educate him for the church, sent him to
college. During a vacation he cros.sed the At-
lantic as supercargo of one of his father's ves-
sels. The vessel was wrecked on the return
voyage, while off the coast of Nova Scotia,
and all on board were taken to Halifax. For
reasons not now known young Cahill remained
in the British Provinces, and for a time taught
school. From his father's estate in England
he received regular remittances as long as he
lived. He married a Miss Lesdernier, a sister
of Mrs. Richard John Uniacke, and settled in
Sackville, N.B. They had eleven children.

Leander Cahill, Dr. Cahill's father, elder son
of Barnaval and Rebecca (Chase) Cahill, was
born in 1834. Coming to Massachusetts at
twenty-three years of age, a wheelwright and
carriage-maker by trade, he lived for a time
in Middlesex County and afterward in Boston,
where he engaged in the business of carriage-
making. Ruth M. Buckman, whom he mar-
ried September 12, 1860, was born in Woburn,
January 7, 1839, the daughter of Dennis and
Ruth Brown (Richard.son) Buckman. Her pa-
ternal grandparents were Jacob and I'^lizabeth
(Munroe) Buckman, of Lexington, Elizabeth
being a daughter of Marrett and Deliverance
(Parker) Munroe anil a descendant of William'
Munroe, of Lexington (who came, it is said,
from Scotland in 1652), and of Thomas' Parker,
an early settler of Reading.

Dennis Buckman was brother to the Hon.
Bowen Buckman and Willis Buckman. Ruth
B. Richardson, his wife, was a daughter of
Jesse^ Richardson, a lineal descendant in the
fifth generation of Samuel Richardson, one of
the three Richardson brothers who were among
the founders of the town of Woburn. The line
was: Samuel,' ^^ Zechariah,'' Jesse,^ the latter a
soldier of the Revolution. Zechariah, born in
1720, married Phebe Wyman, a descendant of
Lieutenant John Wyman, of Woburn. (See
Richardson Genealogy.)

Mrs. Ruth Buckman Cahill was a woman of



character and cultivation, large-hearted and
clear-headed. She was the mother of three
children. The second child, Annie R., died in
infancy; and Frank .\ll)ert, born in 1867, died
in 1883. Eliza, the eldest born, was named for
her uncle Bowen's wife, who had recently
passed away, beloved and lamented. In 1866,
when Eliza was four years old, Mr. and Mrs.
Cahill removed to East Boston, where she at-
tended the public schools till she reached the
age of twelve. In 1874, on account of the
mother's failing health, the family removed to
California. The warm climate proved bene-
ficial to Mrs. Cahill, evidently prolonging her
life, and they remained there till after her
death, which occurred August 24, 1879. In
response to her wishes, Mr. Cahill, who was of
a kind and loving nature, and remained ever
faithful to her memory, returned East to make
a home for his children in Boston, where they
would be not far from their mother's kinsfolk.
Seven years later, his daughter being then es-
tablisheil in her profession, he went back to his
birthplace, the old homestead in Sackville, N.B.,
to be with his younger brother, then in failing
health. In Sackville he continued to reside
till his death, in 1897, cared for tenderly in his
last years of invalidism.

While on the Pacific slope, Eliza had con-
tinued her studies under private teachers.
When she returnetl to Boston, she was seven-
teen, and looking forward to a life of u.sefulness.
With the memory of her mother as a prime
motive power in every noble aspiration and
endeavor, she chose an arduous profession. En-
tering Boston University School of Medicine
in 1883, she received her diploma in 1886. A
week before her graduation Dean Talbot of
the University called her into his room and
said: "Miss Cahill, there is a request before me
for a resident physician for the New England
Conservatory of Music. You fulfil every de-
mand they make of the incumbent save your
age." This was very encouraging to an ambi-
tious young novitiate. She accepted the posi-
tion, and at the end of the first year Dr. Tourjee
asked her to sign a five years' contract. She
declined, on the ground of wishing to be free
to change the scene of her labors if found de-
sirable. She ditl, however, remain for fourteen



84



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



years, spending lier summers in Sackville, N.B.,
with her father, ever attentive to his comfort
and hapi)iness as long as he Hved. At the ex-
piration of five years she had leave of absence,
and went to Europe for hospital work. At
various times she has taken post-graduate
courses in New York and other cities. When
she had been at the Conservatory nine years
(during which time she hatl acquired a large
outside practice, not being in any way re-
stricted by tlie trustees of the Conservatory),
she became lecturer on diseases of women at
Boston University. As her duties increased in
other directions, she wished to resign her posi-
tion at the Conservatory, but was obliged to
wait three years before her resignation would
be accepted. She is ever grateful and appreci-
ative of the unfailing courtesy which was shown
her at tliat institution. In 1900 she took uj)
her residence at the Westminster, Copley
Square.

Doctor Cahill is a busy and happy woman,
loving the profession in which she has been so
successful. She is president of the Twentieth
Century Medical Club, second vice-president of
the Massachusetts Surgical and Gynecological
Society, first vice-president of the Boston
Homa&gt;opathic Medical Society, a member of the
American Institute of Homoeopathy, the Electro-
Therapeutical Society, Society for University
Education of Women, and the Actors' Alliance,
and first vice-president of the Alunmi Associa-
tion of Boston University School of Metlicine.
Although too busy to be often present at the
meetings, she is a member of the New England
Women's Club and the Women's Educational
and Industrial Union and a stockholder in the
Woman'sClub-houseCorporation. From girlhood
she has been a member of the Methodist churcli.



ELIDA RUMSEY FOWLE. philanthropic
worker, one of the founders, in 1863,
of the Soldiers' Free Library and Read-
ing Room in Washington, D.C., has
been for the past fifteen years, with her hus-
band, Mr. John A. Fowle, a resident of Dor-
chester, Mass. She was born in New York
City, June 0, 1842, daughter of John WicklifTo
and Mary Agnes (Underbill) Rumsey.



In 1861 her parents removed to Washing-
Ion. Her mother was constant in works of
love among the soldiers of the Civil War,
and Miss Ruinsey (now Mrs. Fowle) soon
began visiting the hospitals with a desire to
add .sunshine to the dreary days of the sick
and wounded. Realizing that her musical
talents could be of .'^eivice, she sang to them
songs that were an inspiration. Men released
from Libby Prison and located temporarily at
the Soldiers' Rest she arou.?ed from a state of
apathy and gloom to one of courage and ho]ie.
Forming jjlans for improving the condition of
the convalescents antl other soldiers stationed
at Washington, she received the co-operation
of Mr. John A. F'owle, who held a position in
the Navy Department at Washington. They
established a Sunday evening prayer meeting
in Columbian College hospital, an upper room
in "Auntie Pomoroy's" ward being assigned
for the purpose. It was crowded every night,
and overflow meetings were held in a grove
near by. A report of these gatherings in " Our
Army Nurses" says: "The interest steadily in-
creased, the boys often doing double duty in
order to be present. The enthusiasm of the
soldiers could not be repressed when Miss
Rum,sey's sweet voice stirred their souls and
rekindled the noble, self-sacrificing spirit that
had brought them to such a place; and cheers
shook the very walls."

Miss Runisey also saw active ser\'ice among
the wounded and dying on the battle-fiekl.
Mr. Frank Moore, in "Women of the War,"
gives the following account &lt;if her work after
the second battle of Bull Run, fought August
30, 1862: "Mr. Fowle obtained an ambulance,
and Miss Rumsey loaded it with some four
hundred antl fifty loaves of bread, meat, spirits
of all kinds, bandages, lint, shirts, and other
stores. Leaving Washington late on Saturday
afternoon, they drove out by way of Bailey's
Cross-roads, ami reached Centreville very early
on Sunday morning. They halted at a little
building near the road, which was already
nearly full of the wounded. . . . Foi- some time
Miss Rumsey ren\aincd in the ambulance, giv-
ing out bread to the famishing boys, who
crowded around as soon as it was known there
was anything to be eaten there. Most of them



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



85



had eaten nothing for twenty-four liours, anil
were hopelessly separated from their supply
trains. After she had given out most of the
bread and other eatables, she stepped down
from the ambulance, and went inside to see if
she could be of any use to the suffering." The
terrible odor and scenes of suffering caused her
to faint, hut upon recovering she chided her-
self, saying: "To think that I have come all
this way from Washington to bind up the
wounds of these soldiers, and here the first case
of running blood I see I have to become help-
less. I won't faint. I will go back, and work
among these poor fellows. That's what I came
for, and I'm determined to accomplish some-
thing."

During the year 1862 a great many books,
papers, and magazines, received from friends
in the North, were distributed by Mi.ss Rum.sey
and Mr. Fowle in their hospital visits. In a
little more than a year they thus disposed of
two thousand three hundretl and seventy-one
Bibles and Testaments, one thousand six hun-
dred and seventy-fi\e books and magazines,
forty thousand tracts, thirty-five tliousand
papers, twenty-five reams of writing paper,
nine thousand envelopes, also (juantities of
clothing, sheets, wines, and jellies. In the
same period they conducted nearly two thou-
sand singing meetings at hospitals or in camp.

Tliere were times when thirty-four thousand
sick, wounded, or convalescent soldiers were
gathered in Wa.shington, nearly all of whom
could read. Many were able to travel through
the streets on crutches, and others could walk
a .short distance unaided. For the benefit of
these disabled patriots Miss Rumsey, Mr. Fowle,
and Mrs. Walter Baker, of Dorchester, Ma.ss.,
conceived the idea of establishing a free library.
To this end Miss Rumsey and Mr. Fowle gave
in Washington, Boston, and other places, a
number of patriotic vocal concerts, the i)rin-
cipal feature of which was the songs of Miss
Rumsey, and particularly those stirring ami
patriotic airs which she had sung to so manj'
of the soldiers.

In the meantime a petition was sent to Con-
gress asking permission to erect a library build-
ing on land in .Judiciary Square. The result is
seen in the following resolution- "Resolved by



the Senate and House of Rej^resentatives of
the United. States of America in Congress as-
sembled,

"That the Secretary of the Interior be and
is hereby authorized to grant to John A. Fowle
and Elida B. Rum.sey the use of a portion of
the land owned by the United States and known
as 'Judiciary Square,' to erect thereon, free
from charge to the Ignited States, a suitable
building for a soldiers' free library and reading-
room for .soldiers; provided that the same can
be done without prejudice to the public inter-
ests, and provided that the expenses shall be
borne by said Fowle and Rumsey, and that all
benefits and privileges of such library and
reading-room be granted to our soldiers free
of charge, and that said building be removed
whenever the Secretary of the Interior shall
require the same to be done.

"Approved January 13, 1863."

Mr. Fowle and Miss Rumsey continued their
concerts, the proceeds of which, with one hun-
dred dollars contributed l)y Mrs. Walter Baker
and sums from other friends, enabled them to
erect the builtling. It contained a libiary room,
a room for hospital stores, and a reading-room,
and was dedicated Sunday evening, March 1,
with aiipropriate ceremonies. A circular ap-
pealing for funds and books received a generous
response. The first books were received from
four little girls in Dorchester, Ma,ss. Mrs.
\\'alter Baker sent eight hundred volumes, and
through the efforts of other friends, together
with receipts from concerts, six thousand vol-
umes of good reading matter were in the library
before the close of the war. Miss Rumsej'
served as librarian for a while, but later con-
valescents from the hospitals were detailed for
this position.

Miss Rumsey's daily journal of March, 1863,
gives information of interest: "Number of
bortks about five thousand, all covered, num-
bered and catalogued. Reading-room opened
daily from 9 a.m. State papers kept on file.
The decorations of the hall the donations of
soldiers' friends at the North. Writing pajjci-,
])en, and ink always to be found on tahles for
u.se of soldiers. On an average fifty letters sent
to the i)ost-office daily.

ing Sunday afternoons. Room accommodates
about four hundred with comfortable settees.
Soldiers take an active part. Citizens, too,
attend these meetings, and the citizens cheer
the soldiers. Tuesday evenings a soldiers' con-
cert, the room always crowded. The use of
the building free to all soldiers, State associa-
tions, and all benevolent objects. The privi-
lege of fifty volumes or more is offered to the
chaplain and friends, to be distributed in hospi-
tals out of the city, to be returned or exchanged
for others within two weeks.

"The store-room in the building always con-
tains a goodly supply of articles suitable for
the soldiers' use, and is often replenished by
the noble women of the North."

A soldiers' church was formed, having about
two hundred members, of all denominations;
and to each soldier member of the little free
library church was given a small certificate,
having a picture of the library and bearing the
name of the soldier, his company and regi-
ment, the State where he lived, ancl these three
simple articles: "(1) I will try to the best of
my ability to be a Christian. (2) I will take
the Word of God for my guide and trust in
Christ alone for salvation. (3) I solenmly
pledge myself to abstain from profane language,
from alcoholic drinks as a beverage, and from
all vices of the army and camp, and will be a
true soldier of my country and the cross."
This certificate was signed by Mr. Fowle and
Miss Rumsey, with date. More than one sol-
dier boy was identified on the battle-fields by
this little certificate, found in his pocket.

Miss Rumsey was married on Sunday, March
1, 1863, to Mr. John Allen Fowle. The cere-
mony was performed by the Rev. Alonzo H.
Quint, Chaplain of the Second Massachusetts
Regiment and pastor of the Congregational
Church, Jamaica Plain, Mass., where Mr. Fowle
attended. The bride and bridegroom were
leaders of the Capitol Choir, which furnished
the music for the Sunday services established
in the House of Representatives in 1862; and
their work, which had given them a national
reputation, was appreciated by their friends
in Congress. Representatives' Hall in the Cap-
itol was offered them, and the announcement
that the wedding would take place there re-



sulted in an attendance of four thousand
people. President Lincoln, who had signified
his intention of being present, but was unex-
pectedly detained, sent a magnificent basket
of flowers.

Mr. Fowle was born April 4, 1826, son of
George Makepeace and Margaret L. (Eaton)
Fowle. He is a descendant in the seventh gen-
eration of George Fowle, who was born in Scot-
land in 1610, and was admitted a freeman in
Concord, Mass., in 1632. He has been a dry-
goods and wool merchant in Boston since 1855,
with the exception of some years after the Civil
War, when they lived in Brooklyn, N.Y. They
were active in the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher's
church. In Dorchester they are interested in
the Pilgrim Congregational Church. Mr. Fowle
is a member of the Dorchester Historical Soci-
ety and the Improvement Association. Of the
" Bungalow," the summer home of Mr. and Mrs.
Fowle at North Scituate, a newspaper corre-
spondent has said, "Not to have known the
' Bungalow ' is to have missed one of the quaint-
est nooks on the South Shore."

The home of Mr. and Mrs. Fowle in Dorches-
ter contains many valuable relics. "There on
the wall is an old flag with its thirteen stars,
which saw service in the War of 1812 as well as
in the Civil War. Here over the case is a Con-
federate flag, one of the first captured, and pre-
sented to Mrs. Fowle by Admiral Foote, now
intertwined with the stars and stripes. Among
other relics are a Washington plate and a china
saucer, both of which were presented to Mrs.
Fowle by Aunt Sally Norris, who was a slave
in the family of General Lee; some pieces of
shell taken from the battle-field; an autograph
album containing the names of thousands of
soldiers; several letters from S. F. Smith, the
author of 'America'; one from Oliver Wendell
Holmes, with his additional verse to the 'Star-
spangled Banner'; a directory of the soldiers
and the hospitals, issued by Mr. Fowle in Wash-
ington." Mrs. Fowle has the writing-desk
which was sent her from Dorchester and which
she used during the war; an old chair made of
hardtack boxes used in camp of the Fourth
Delaware Battery; also a melodeon, useil in
camp, ho.spital, and library; and many other
interesting anil valuable souvenirs of those

dark years. On the walls is a copy of the
above mentioned resolution of Congress. This
copy was signed by Abraham Lincoln in the
presence of Mrs. Fowle.

Mrs. Fowle and her mother, Mrs. Rmnsey,
were among the earliest workers in Mrs. Bur-
nap's Free Home for Aged Women, on Han-
over Court (North End), Boston; in Mrs.
Charpiot's Home for Intemperate Women, on
Worcester Street; the New England Helping
Hand Home for Working-girls, on Carver
Street; Home for Aged Couples, on Shawmut
Avenue; and the Charity Hospital, on Chester
Park. At present both Mr. and Mrs. Fowle
are interested in establishing a library and
reading and recreation room for boys and
girls on old Boston Street, near Upham's
Corner, Dorchester. She has been connected
with the Woman's Christian Tenij)erance Union
of Dorchester; is a member of the Woman's
Charity Club; of the Massachusetts Army
Nurses' Association; of the Ladies' Aid A.sso-
ciation of the Soldiers' Home; and of Bunker
Hill Chapter, Daughters of the American Revo-
lution.

Mrs. Fowle claims the honor of having been
the first person to sing the ^Battle Hymn of
the Republic" at a public meeting in Washing-
ton. Its previous use was by a secret society
as a club song. The Rev. Dr. Sunderland read
it to her one afternoon in his home, and at
her request gave her a copy, that she might in-
clude it among the war songs she was to sing
in the evening at a meeting of the New York
State Society in one of the churches. The
meeting was presided over by Senator Ira
Harris. Toward the close she sang the inspir-
ing words of Mrs. Howe to the old familiar
tune of "John Brown," and "as the audience
joinetl in the chorus, especially after the last
verse, beginning with 'In the beauty of the
lilies,' the very foundation stones of the church,"
she .says, "seemed to vibrate with applause."



JANE W. HOYT.— Among tho.se who, in
the early part of the nineteenth century,
anticipated by personal application to
study the later movement for the higher
education of women was Miss Jane W. Hoyt.



She was born in Phillips, Franklin County, Me.,
August 26, 1827, the youngest of a family of
nine children. Her parents, Samuel and Eliza-
beth (Tower) Hoyt, were of early New Eng-
land stock, her father, a native of New Hamp-
ton, N.H., being a lineal descendant of John'
Hoyt, one of the original settlers of Salisbury,
Mass., and her mother belonging to the family
foimded by John' Tower, who came from
Hingham, Englanil, and settled in Hingham,
Mass., in 1637. From John' Tower the line
continueil through Ibrook," Richard,^ Elisha,*
Elisha,^ all of Hingham, Mass., to Sylvanus,"
born in 1766, who married Mercy Card, settled
in Farmington, Me., and was the father of
Elizabeth' (Mrs. Samuel Hoyt) and her brother
Daniel.

As a child, Jane Hoyt evinced a love for
study which grew with her years. This was
gratified in her native town and at Farmington,
which was then, as now, the educational centre
of the county. She afterward was graduated
with honor from the New Hampton Literary
Institution, in New Hampton, N.H., and became
a successful teacher and principal of some of
the higher schools then open to women, as the
Maine State Seminary at Lewiston, the semi-
nary at Olneyville, R.I., and Hillsdale College,
Hillsdale, Mich., where she was dean of the
women's department. In 1871 and 1872 she
took an exteiuled trip to Europe, antl made a
special study of German under private teachers
and in the schools of Hanover. On her return
she was elected to a professorship in Center
College, Penn.sylvania, anil later was at the
head of a boarding and day school in Goshen,
N.Y. In 1874, her health becoming impaired,
she resigneil the position and returned to Farm-
ington. Here her home life was exceptionally
happy, her brother Daniel, her sister Ann, and
herself making a most hospitable household.
The death of the brother in 1899 was a great
grief to the sisters; but, dwelling not on their
own sorrow, they sought to comfort others.
Though fond of books and much engaged with
pupils, MLss Hoyt was ever ready to give her
time and strength to aid neighbors and friends.

Soon after her return to Farmington and be-
fore taking her much needed rest, she sought
two friends and proposed the formation of a



88

women's club. This was in the very early
days of clubs for women: in all New England
there were only a few. The new club entered
at once upon its work, and continued for many
years one of the oldest women's clubs in Maine.
In its origin it was true to the German proverb,
"All good things go in tlirees": it had but three
members. That tliere might be no favoritism,
each member was to bear the Piclcwickian title
P. P. Miss Hoyt was made Perpetual Presi-
dent, and the two remaining members were
made Perpetual Poet and Perpetual Penman.
There was no treasurer, as there were no club
dues. As the membership was at first exclu-
sive, one who was not invited to join remarked
that she thought the ladies were rather "hifa-
lutin." The term so pleased the members of
the club that they concluded to adopt it; anrl
the Hifalutin Club, with an increase of member-
ship, continued until Maine agitated the fed-
eration of its women's clubs, when the Every
Monday Club of Farmington was organized,
and the Hifalutin fell asleep. It was the orig-
inal idea of the club to read at home and dis-
cuss the matter read in the club. It was in
every sense a working club; every play and
many of the sonnets of Shakespeare were
studied, also Spenser's "Faerie Queene," Chau-
cer's Canterbury Tales, Milton, Dante, and
other classic writers. With a retentive mem-
ory and viviti imagination. Miss Hoyt delighted
to review for the benefit of the club the lead-
ing fiction of that day. The writer recalls
"Uarda" and "The Egyptian Princess" and
many other books thus graphically portrayed.
Miss Hoyt believed in keeping abreast of the
times, and was a wise reader of the daily news-
papers. The consideration of current events
formed an important feature in the Hifalutin
Club.

On May 18, 1901, there came a hush over
the village of Farmington, when it was an-
nounced that Jane W. Hoyt was dead. For
twenty-five years she had lived her useful, un-
ostentatious life in that community, loved and
respected by all classes of society. As a private
tutor she had given direction to the college life
of many young men and women by imparting
to them an enthusia.sm for work. They lin-
gered long over their recitations, that between



the lines they might catch glimpses of the
spirit that actuated her. Few of her pupils
will fail to remember the talks on practical
ethics and moral philosophy which she loved
to interweave with the higher mathematics,
Latin, French, and German. In addition to
her labors as a teacher Miss Hoyt carrietl on
other literary work. She wrote for the press,
and was much sought after as a lecturer before
women's clubs and the Chautautjuan assem-
blies, especially those at Ocean Park. Her
chiu'ch affiliations were with the Free Baptist
denomination.

Miss Hoyt was a woman of unusual mental
powers and of a highly spiritual nature. She
had rare literary taste and an ability to assimi-
late knowledge that gave her abundant re-
sources. The excellent school advantages of
her early days were supplemented by constant
application to study throughout her life. Euro-
pean travel still further broadened her mental
scope. Her love of study was not confined to
secular subjects: she devoted a great deal of
attention to the Bible, and lived much in the
contemplation of things that are unseen and
eternal.



EMMA JANE MAREAN RIPLEY, phi-
lanthropist, wife of Sewall C. Ripley,
president of the Thomas P. Beals Com-
pany of Portland, was born in Durham,
Me., April 8, 1848, the daughter of Charles
Livermore Marean and Mary Sherwood Drink-
water Marean. She comes from patriotic
stock. Her maternal grandfather, Perez
Drinkwater, second, served as Lieutenant on
the privateer "Lucy" in the War of 1812,
and was a prisoner in Dartmoor Prison, Eng-
land, for thirteen months. His father and
her great-grandfather, Perez Drinkwater, was
an officer in the Revolutionary War.

Mrs. Ripley is a graduate of the Casco Street
Seminary in the city of Portland, where the
most of her life has been spent, and has been
an attendant of the Second Parish Church,
the Payson Memorial, from her childhood.
She is a prominent member of the Ladies'
Circle and the Missionary Auxiliary. The
poor of the city know her, for she never turns

a deaf ear to their appeals nor sends them away
empty-handed. She not only gives Uberally
to recognizetl charities, but helps with generous
and wise consideration families and individ-
uals who need assistance. Her quiet deeds of
charity are as numerous as those which are gen-
erally known. For fourteen years she has repre-
sented the church as ilirector of the Diet Mis-
sion, in which she holds the offices of room
committee and ward visitor. This society sup-
plies food and dainties to the impoverished
sick of the city. Mrs. Ripley has al.so been
a working member of the Woman's Auxiliary
of the Y. M. C. A. for many years and a mem-
ber of the Female Samaritan Association,
which is the oldest charitable association in
Portland, and celebrated its seventy-fourth
birthday on March 4, 1901. She is one of the
oldest members of the Portland A.ssociated
Charities as well as a ward visitor. She be-
longs also to the Portland Provident Associa-
tion, and is a worker in the Fraternity House,
a social settlement. Mrs. Ripley is likewise
a member of the Conklin Parliamentary Club,
the Cresco Literary Club, the Woman's Literary
Union of Portland, the Equal Suffrage Club,
the National Society of Daughters of the
American Revolution, the Elizabeth Wad.s-
worth Chapter of the Daughters of the Ameri-
can Revolution, of Portland, Me., and the Na-
tional Society of U. S. Daughters of 1812, State
of Maine.

Guy Liverraore Ripley, the only child of
Mr. and Mrs. Ripley, died at the age of twenty
years, four months. A handsome memorial
to him has been placed in the Portland High
School.



ANNIE COOLIDGE RUST was born in
/ \ Richmond, Va., one of a family of
X jL nine children. Her father, Thomas
Adams Rust, a very successful hard-
ware merchant in Richmond, was a native of
Salem, Mass. His wife, Miss Rust's mother,
in maidenhood Phoebe Cutler Chamberlain,
was born in New Hampshire, but had removed
to Boston with her parents when she was a
child. She was well educated and very ac-
tive in church affairs in Boston, being a mem-



ber of the palish of the Rev. Robert C. Waters-
ton, by whom their marriage ceremony was
performed in 18 — .

Richmond in those days seemed a long dis-
tance for the bride to be going from her home
and mother, and it was agreed by the husband
that a part of each year should be passed in
"dear old Boston." The house in which they
lived in Richmond, and in which Mi.ss Rust
was born, was a typical Southern house of
many large rooms, the servants' quarters and
kitchen being in a separate building. In this
Southern home many Boston friends, also
frientls and business associates from England,
were hospitably entertained.

While their chiklren were still young, Mr.
and Mrs. Rust, being anxious that they should
have the best educational advantages, removed
to Cambridge, Mass., and, after some of the chil-
dren were graduated from the Cambridge schools,
the family removed to Boston. The mother
believed that it would be of great advantage
to every young woman to have a knowledge
of the Froebelian jjrinciples of education, known
as the Kindergarten System, which applies to
the life of the little child, but knew not of any
such school in this vicinity. While visiting
a friend in Cambridge one day. the conversa-
tion turned upon a " play school" that had been
opened in Boston, where the children had no
books. The term "play school" interested
the mother. She looked into the matter, and
learned that the name was given in irony by
those who did not know what it was. To her
great delight, it was a Kinilergarten antl Normal
Class, which Madame Kreige and her tlaughter,
Alma Kreige, from Berlin, had opened in Bos-
ton, they having been requested by their teacher,
Baroness von Marenholtz Bulow, to come to
America and introduce this system of etluca-
tion. Mrs. Rust was much pleased to find
just what she hafl been looking for, and at her
earnest rei [uest her daughter entered the school
as a pupil in one of the first Normal Classes. Mi.ss
Rust brought to this work, besides an aj:)titude
for it and the enthusiasm of youth, rare insight
into child nature, a cultivated mind, and
deep religious feeling. Moreover, ideas gained
from conversations with her teacher were so
unlike those by which she had been governed

when in school that she was deeply attracted,
and wished to learn more of this beautiful
system, which made the life of the child and
its studies so delightful. Therefore it was
with great pleasure that she entered upon the
work, which grew for her more and more in-
teresting and absorliing.

Previous to this time Miss Ellizabeth Peabody
had gone to Europe for the purpose of learning
more of this system and its true meaning, and
she was much pleased when the Baroness in-
formed her that Madame Kreige and her daugh-
ter had already started for America for the
purpose of opening a school there. On the
return of Miss Peabody, both she and her sis-
ter, Mrs. Horace Mann, rendered all the as-
sistance to Madame Kreige and daughter that
was in their power, materially aiding the prog-
ress of the school and work as a whole.

After a successful course of study Miss Rust
was graduated in June. She was in good
health and very anxious to put her knowledge
of the system into practice. A summer kin-
dergarten was offered her, which she accepted,
she being one of the first pupils of Madame
Kreige to teach.

In the following autunm through her in-
structor, Madame Kreige, a fine opportunity
to teach a private kindergarten with a large
salary was offeretl her in the A\'est, which she
accepted. There she was most pleasantly lo-
cated, both educationally and socially, and
by the many attentions offered her was made
at once to feel at home in a strange city. Ac-
cess was also given her to the private libraries
of the most influential people of the city. The
fact of this school being supported by the most
influential people was what gave her these
advantages.

At the approach of spring Miss Rust, much
to her regret, found that the climate did not
agree with her, and felt obliged to give up her
position and return to Boston. Not long after
a lady came to Boston to secure a teacher
for a private school near New York. Miss
Rust being recommended to her, she was en-
gaged for this promising position with more
healthful surroundings. Here, also, she gave
satisfaction. One of the mothers, a patron,
sending three children to the school, was so



pleased that she invited Miss Rust to come
to live in her home, for the sake of her soul-
ful influence over the children, which she
did, and remained through one school year,
teaching the older children music on kin-
dergarten principles, at the same time that
she was holding her position as teacher of the
private school. At the close of this school
year Miss Rust was invited to visit the family at
their summer home on the seashore.

From that place she was called South by
her father and mother, to as.sist in the dispo-
sition of their property, as her opinion was
always desired by them in all matters of busi-
ness. She remained South through a part
of the summer, until this was accomplislied,
the family returning in the autumn to their
own house in Boston.

A parent who had heard of Miss Rust tlirough
Madame Kreige desired that she should open
a private kindergarten at her (Miss Rust's)
own house, saying she would secure pupils for
her from her own friends, which she did. Miss
Rust was extremely happy in this kindergar-
ten; she was able to do so much more for the
children in her own home. One morning a
mother entered, saying she would like to send
her children to the school for a half-year, " not
expecting them to learn anything," but from
selfish motives, as she wished the children kept
away from her in the morning, as she was
a writer. One morning six or eight weeks
later, instead of the maid, the mother came
to the kindergarten with the children, offering
an apology for the remark she had matle at
her first visit, and bringing words of ajiprecia-
tion from the father of what the children had
voluntarily expressed at home, also asking the
favor of coming every morning for the week, to
realize what was being done for them and what it
all meant. A few weeks after a lengthy arti-
cle appeared in the Boston Transcript, written
by this mother and relating to Miss Rust's
work, then not a year old in Boston. This
article was an elucidation of the system from
a mother's standpoint, treating not only of
the work done l)y tlie children, but of the in-
fluence of the kindergartner upon the life of each
child, which is the soul of the kindergarten.
Instead of the children remaining the half-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



91



year, as first agreed, they remained in the school
for four years. As a result of the article in
the Transcript there were many visitors to the
kindergarten each day, both residents of Bos-
ton and strangers. A gentleman from Chicago,
an educator, after a visit to the school, pro-
nounced it education in its highest sense, and
said that he would like to take some of the
material as a means of rendering instruction
to his young ladies in .some of the higher
branches.

And thus the interest grew, and the class
increased in numbers, until a larger room was
taken in their house. Here a Mothers' Class
was started; and, as Miss Rust considered her-
self too much of a novice to assume the respon-
sibility of this class, at her request Miss Pea-
body took the charge. She was a great in-
spiration to the work, and this Mothers' Class
and also this home was blessed by her presence,
as she often remained after the hour of the
class, and thus the family pas.sed many happy
hours with her socially.

One of the patrons of this school now removed
to Brookline, and, desiring her children to
remain under Miss Rust's instruction, made
arrangements for an afternoon kintlergarten to
be established in her home, the location of
which was unusually adapted to such a pur-
pose, the house, with pine woods near, being
surrounded by nature in all its beauty. This
kindergarten was carried on until the city
classes had gro^\^l to such a size that they re-
quired Mi.ss Rust's full attention, time, and
strength. Not long after this the health of Mrs.
Rust failed, her strength not being equal to hav-
ing the school (which with its advanced classes
it had now become) in the house; therefore it
was removed from the home. These advanced
classes were beyond the kindergarten age, but
none were allowed to enter them who had not
had previous preparation either in this kinder-
garten or in another, equally genuine, thus
making the school a strong, connected whole,
without disturbance or confusion for the pupils'
minds, one class, as it were, evolving from an-
other. Children were received from three or
four years of age, as the child's health allowed,
until the age of twelve. All the instruction
was given upon Froebelian principles. Usu-



ally chiUlren at six years were startetl in the
so-called primary work, which, with their pre-
vious jjreparation, was easily grasped, the chil-
tlren being just as eager about their arithmetic,
for example, as they had been about the attrac-
tive kindergarten gifts and occupations. The
originality of each child had been preserved, and
now was most beautifully manifested along the
Hues of art, music, games, and so forth. Music
was taught on kindergarten principles, and in
this way it is a possession to the pupil not easily
forgotten. Pupils returning to the school in
the fall went right on with their music as if
there had been no vacation. The folding oc-
cupation, previously taught, prepared the flex-
ible little hand for music, making the fingers
deft and securing the right position of the hand,
thus saving two or more terms of instruction.
In fact, the analytical and synthetical method
of the child's previous instruction made all its
after work and study a pleasure, and proved
that it was fully grasped, being its own posses-
sion.

Miss Rust had desired to have the extreme
pleasure of proving the benefit of the system
by taking the children on in these advanced
classes after the kindergarten stage, and it is
now a great source of delight to her to look
back upon this experience, and also to receive
voluntary testimonials like this from pupils
who have passeil (jn through other schools
to the Boston Institute of Technology: "We
did not know what was being done for us. Miss
Rust, when we were little fellows in your kin-
dergarten, but now we realize what it meant
for us all along the line and here in our instruc-
tion." In order to have justice done to this
system, the child must have it as a whole.
Thus much time and waste of nervous energy
are saved in the higher grades.

In the meantime the school had grown to
such a size that a hou.se was taken, and Miss Rust
associated henself with a kindergarten-trained
mother, they together undertaking the estab-
lishment of a Kindergarten Normal Class for
young ladies. Mi.ss Rust modestly felt that
this mother, being older and more experienced
in life, was better fitted than herself to under-
take the responsibility of training young la-
dies, although urged to do it. She, however,



92



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



assisted this mother. After a while the health
of the mother failed, and the class was con-
tinued for one year, being finished by the
assistance of one of its older pupils.

At this tinie it was deemed advisable to "estab-
lish a school in a new location out of the city,
with larger grounds and surrounded by the
beauties of nature. A location quite near Bos-
ton was decided upon as being the most desirable
and delightful one for a class of this kind.
A kindergarten was soon started by Miss
Rust, and after three years' time here again
were the different classes above the kinder-
garten department. It was impossible to se-
cure suitable rooms for the size of the school,
and for this reason for a time the school was
limited to nearly one-half, consequently the
patrons decided to build a model build-
ing, with the understanding that Miss Rust
should hire the building and carry on her
school, as before, in a much improved way,
and more in harmony with her ideas of a
model Froebelian school, as all the work was
based upon the Froebelian principles of educa-
tion.

During the summer Miss Rust was often con-
sulted as to the best arrangement of the build-
ing, and helped in its plans, .she coming for this
purpose several times from the seashore at
Magnolia, where she usually passed her sum-
mers, having nature-study classes, thus collect-
ing specimens of sea flora, minerals, and so
forth, for the fall classes of the new school.

This building was soon accomplished, the
promoters using the name of Miss Rust in sell-
ing shares. Sixty shares at one hundred dol-
lars each were soon sold, mostly to patrons of
the school, with the understantling that the
money was to be used for her school. Unfort-
unately, one who had financial rather than edu-
cational interests at heart, and who had with
a view to this purpose bought up a number
of shares of the stock, decided that other ar-
rangements should be made, and that, while
Miss Rust should occupy the building, she
should be allowed to do so on a salary, and they
would own the school. This Mi.ss Rust in a
dignified manner positively refused to do, say-
ing she had built a school and they had built
a building, and she preferred to have nothing



to do with it, unless she could carry on the
school in the building as first agreed. With
their plans her hands would be completely
tied, as it was upon a financial basis rather
than an educational, and her reputation as a
teacher of these principles was far more to her
than the salary offered.

At this decision of hers, generous offers were
made by parents to retain her, saying they
would make up the deficiency in salary if she
would but remain; but Miss Rust, while grate-
ful to these patrons for their sympathy and
kind offers, said she saw no reason for accept-
ing presents, it being with her a matter of
principle ; as, under the proposed conditions, she
would be unable to make it the model school
she desired, or add to it her Kindergarten
Normal Classes.

About this time an urgent appeal came to
Miss Rust from a Western city to accept the
position of head instructor in a Kindergarten
Normal Class, which had been started by the
Free Kindergarten Association, and also as
instructor in one of the free kindergartens,
numbering one hundred children, started that
autumn, both of which she accepted. It is
a great pleasure to her to refer to this large
work with the less fortunate little ones.
She was also very successful with the Normal
Class. But the climate of that city, with its
strong lake winds, was too severe for Miss
Rust, and she was suddenly stricken down by
pneumonia, for several days her life hanging
upon a thread. Upon her recovery she was
unable to resume her work there, and felt the
need of returning to Boston, which she did.
After a short rest she was advised to go to an
inland . city, and having an opportunity to
purchase in Worcester a private school, of chil-
dren from three to twelve years of age, she
accepted, naming it the Froebel School, at the
same time starting a Kindergarten Normal
Class, being urgetl to do this by a member of
the State Board of Education, as there was no
such Training School in Worcester. Her work
there also was very successful, graduating large
classes, employing some of our best pecial
lecturers for the instruction of the classes as
well as for the graduation exercises. Miss
Rust, in addition to her school work in Worces-

ter, gave talks before different clubs in that
city and elsewhere.

After several years of successful work in
Worcester, Miss Rust, being closely confined
by the amount of labor required in her schools,
realized that she was shut off from many things
with which she needed to keep in touch in
order to grow. She therefore felt that she must
return to her former home, Boston, where she
would have all desired advantages, and here
re-establish herself in her Kindergarten Normal
Classes.

Although urged by former pupils, being now
parents, to again organize a kindergarten and
school for children, she has decided to give her
time to the instruction of Normal Classes only
and to talks before clubs. Miss Rust has now
returned to this city for her permanent home,
and has her Kindergarten Normal Classes
well established at the New Century Building.
She was a member of the American Froebel
Union started in Boston by Miss Elizabeth
Palmer Peabody. This became the Kindergar-
ten Department of the National Etlucational As-
sociation. At this time s}ie was urged by Miss
Peabody to join the New England Woman's
Club. She is a member of the Eastern Kin-
dergarten Association, the National Education
Association, the International Kindergarten
Union, and the AVomen's Educational and
Industrial Union. She was formerly a member
of the Worcester Woman's Club, and helped
to organize the Women in Council Club, Rox-
bury, Mass. In all the years since she started
as a Kintlergartner, she has never lowered her
high standard, nor hesitntetl to make any sacri-
fice demanded by the cause to who.se advance-
ment her life is consecrated. She belongs to
Trinity (Episcopal) Church, Boston.

She has lived to see the children of her
earlier classes develop in noble men and women,
several of the number having distinguished
themselves in literature, science, and art.

The strongest testimony to her abilit\ as
an educator is given in these results of char-
acter and achievement, which in a special
way have marked Miss Rust's work in Boston
and elsewhere in her Froebel School and Kinder-
garten Normal Classes. It is just aiid right,
however, that those of a later generation who



now reap from fruitful fields should acknowl-
edge their debt to the pioneer kindergartners
who prepared the ground and planted the
good seed.



MARY ELIZA KNOWLES, Past Na-
tional Chaplain of the Woman's Re-
lief Corps, was born in Boston,
February 14, 1847. Daughter of
Jacob and P'mmeline (Reed) Clones and one
of a large family of children, .she was brought
up at the North End, in a locality rich in his-
toric and patriotic associations, her home being
in the vicinity of Christ Church ami Copp's
Hill, and was educated at the Hancock School.
After her graduation she made a special study
of elocution, of which she has been a successful
teacher. She is also a popular public reatler.
The marriage of Mary E. Clones and Zoeth Rich
Knowles took place June 14, 1866.

Mrs. Knowles's father was the third Jacob
Clones in tlirect line residing in Boston. His
grandfather Clones died in 1799. His father,
Jacob Clones, 2d, who married Phebe Ann
Low, daughter of William Low, died in 1815.
W'illiam Low, great-grandfather of Mrs.
Knowles, was a Revolutionary soldier, belong-
ing to a company of militia that was called into
service at the time of the Lexington alarm,
April 19, 1775.

Mrs. Knowles is a charter member of Abra-
ham Lincoln Corps, No. 39, auxiliary to Post
No. 1 1 , Charlestown. She was installed April
22, 1884, as its first Senior ^'ice-President, and
in January, 1885, accepted the position of Presi-
dent, serving continually in office and on com-
mittees. Her first participation in a Depart-
ment Convention was in 1886, when she was
invited to present a baimer procured by con-
tribution from members. The pleasing manner
in which she performed this duty made such
a favorable impression that she was elected
Department Chaplain, and re-elected in 1887.
In her second annual report as Chaplain she
reconnnended that a special service in honor
of the unknown dead and of deceased army
nurses be })repare(l for use on Memorial Day.

Mrs. Knowles was elected Department Junior
Vice-Presitlent in 1888, and m this capacity



94



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



attended the National Convention at Colum-
bus, Ohio. In 1889 she was chosen Depart-
ment Senior Vice-President, and in February,
1890, received the highest office in the Depart-
ment of Massacliusetts, that of Department
President. It was in August of this year that
the National Encampment of the Grand Army
of the Republic was held in Boston, antl many
extra duties devolved upon her. She was a
vice-president of the general committee and
a member of the executive committee of arrange-
ments for the National Convention, also chair-
man of the reception committee and an active
worker on the committee on finance, press, and
invitation. In her general order to the corps
some time previous she said: "This year prom-
ises to be the most important one in the history
of this Department. This dear old State of
ours will be honored above all others during
the month of August. From all parts of the
country the veterans of the G. A. R. and our
sisters of the W. R. C. will come to us. Prove
to them that the Mother Department of our
order can be as royal in her hospitality as she
is generous and tender in her care and protec-
tion of her country's defenders."

Mrs. Knowles, in her official visits to corps
and at public meetings, earnestly referred to
the plans for encampment week in Boston, and
awakened great interest in the object. She
had a prominent part in the festivities of the
week, and assisted in welcoming to Boston the
President of the United States and other dis-
tinguished citizens. The liberal respon.se of
the corps and the able management of the
committee enabled all bills to be paid, with a
surplus of one thousand tlollars on hand.
Therefore the sum of three thousand dollars
appropriated by the G. A. R. for the expenses
of the Woman's Relief Corps during the week
was returned to the Grand Army committee.

In presenting her annual address to the De-
partment Convention of 1891, Mrs. Knowles
thanked the members for their hearty interest,
and said: "When the word was brought back
to us from Milwaukee that the eighth National
Convention would be held in Boston, every
niembfT in the Department began to feel that
she would do her part toward welcoming those
who would come from all sections of our be-



loved land, wearing the little bronze badge.
The work of preparation for this memorable
event occupied many months of careful and un-
tiring labor, and the grand results accom-
plished elicited words of prai.ie and gratitude
from the visiting members of the Grand Army
of the Republic and the Woman's Relief Corps."

Captain George L. Goodale, chairman of the
executive committee of the G. A. R., when for-
warding the official thanks of the committee,
extended congratulations upon the grand suc-
cess of the efforts of the AV. R. C, and added:
"No feature of the week of duty and of pleas-
ure was more enjoyable than the camp-fire at
Tremont Temple on the evening of Friday,
August 15." Three thousand people attended
this Relief Corps gathering in Tremont Temple,
and three thousand more were turned away,
disappointed that they were unable to gain
admittance. Governor Brackett, Mayor Hart,
General W. T. Sherman, Commander-in-chief
Wheelock G. Veazie, Mrs. Annie Wittenmeyer
(National President), Miss Clara Barton, Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe, and other distinguished
speakers were present. One of the attractive
features of the programme was a rearling by
Mrs. Knowles of a poem entitled "The Massa-
chusetts AVoman," written for the occasion by
Mrs. Kate B. Sherwood, of Canton, Ohio, a past
National President.

In an address at the Department Convention
in Boston, February, 1891, she gave a sum-
mary of the year's work, from which the fol-
lowing extracts are taken: "The growth of our
order in Ma.ssachusetts during the past year
has been most encouraging. At the end of the
official year of 1890 our roster bore one huntlred
and twenty-five corps with a membership of
nine thousand and ten. To-day we have one
hundred and thirty-seven corps, with a mem-
bership of ten thousand six hundretl, a gain of
one thousand five hundred and ninety. The
sum of seventeen thousand one hundred and
tliirty-four dollars and thirty-four cents repre-
sents the value of relief expenditures and
money turned over to posts.

"On the 7th of last June I was honored with
an invitation from the Board of Trustees of
the Soldiers' Home to participate in the dedi-
cation of the new part of the home. The in-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



95



teresting exercises and incidents of the occasion
will be remembered as long as life shall last.
I have visited the home whenever it was possi-
ble for me to do so.

"The official correspondence of the year
has required much time and thought. I have
written more than a thousand letters, and have
issued eight general orders antl one circular
letter. Many invitations to fairs, camp-fires,
anniversaries of posts and corps, have been ac-
cepted and thoroughly enjoyed. I have always
been received at these gatherings with much
courtesy and cordiality. I have assisted at the
opening of four fairs, atteniled four receptions,
eleven anniversaries, instituted two corps, in-
stalled the officers of twenty-four corps, visited
many other corps and delivered the Memorial
Day address at Leominster. Have been present
at headcjuarters every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Satunlay, with but two exceptions."

Mrs. I\iiowles served as Department Coun-
sellor in 1891, and continued her active inter-
est, visiting corps, participating in camp-fires,
and other patriotic gatherings. By invita-
tion of Granil Army posts she has delivered
Memorial Day adtlresses in many parts of the
State and in New Hampshire, and has been an
elo(iuent missionary for the order. She con-
tinues her active work in the Department
W. R. C, and has great influence in the con-
ventions.

Her portrait hangs upon the walls of the
Department headiiuarters in Boston. It was
presented by Abraham Lincoln Corps, of
Charlestown, in which she is still an active
and honored member. Colonel Allen Corps, of
Gloucester, the first corps instituted by Mrs.
Knowles, has placed in its room at the Soldiers'
Home in Chelsea a beautiful banner bearing
her name.

She was assistant secretary at the National
Convention at Detroit in 1891, and at Wash-
ington, D.C., in 1892, was unanimously elected
National Chaplain for the ensuing year.

As a professional elocutionist, Mrs. Knowles
has filled engagements in many halls and
churches in Ma.ssachusetts and other New
England States, and has thus aided financially
many churches, posts, corps, and other societies.
Mrs. Knowles is one of the vice-presidents of the



Executive Committee of Arrangements for the
National Convention in Boston in August, 1904.
One of the most elo(|uent addresses ever given
at a public gathering of the order was her
presentation of a flag to the Girls' High School
of Boston on behalf of the Department of Mas-
sachusetts at its anniversary observance in the
People's Temple, Boston, February 10, 1904.
She is sure of appreciative audiences whenever
taking part, in any service.

She was a member of the Ladies' Aid Asso-
ciation of the Soldiers' Home, and now belongs
to the New England Helping Hand Society.
She is State treasurer of the Independent Order
of Odd Ladies, and was for several years secre-
tary of the relief fund of this order. Her re-
ports to the insurance conmiissioner of Massa-
chusetts were complimented by that official,
who regarded them as the best reports receivetl
from any fraternal insurance organization.

Mrs. Knowles is actively interested in church
and Sunday-school work. For many years
connected with the Bulfinch Place Church (Uni-
tarian) in Boston, she is now a member of the
Winter Hill Universalist Church.

Mr. and Mrs. Zoeth Rich Knowles have lived
in Somerville since 1894. They have no chil-
dren. Mr. Knowles was in the signal service
of the Union army during the Civil War. He
is a Past Commander of Abraham Lincoln Post,
No. 11, G. A. R., of Charlestown, where they
formerly resitled. Mr. Knowles was one of
the conu-ades of the Grantl Army of the Re-
public who early in its history advocated form-
ing Relief Corps, auxiliary to posts.



ETHEL HYDE.— The earthly sojourn of
Miss Ethel Hyde, comprised within the
brief period of twenty-eight years, was
a healthy, contentetl, happy life, that
reflected the sumiy radiance of a pure soul,
and, measured by quality, may be said to have
been rounded out anil complete.

Miss Hyde was born in Bath, Me., on the
thirtieth day of August, 1871. Her father was
General Thomas Worcester Hyde, and her pa-
ternal grandparents were Zina and Eleanor
(Davis) Hyde. As a leading merchant of Bath
in his day, Zina Hyde held an influential posi-



96



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



tion in the community. He was a man of
scholarly and artistic tastes, and travelled ex-
tensively in Europe. Thomas Worcester Hyde
was born in Florence, Italy, January 15, 1841 , and
was graduated at Bowdoin College in 1861. In
the .sununer of that year he raised a companj'
of volunteers for the Seventh Maine Regiment.
Appointed Major in August, he had the honor,
in the ab.sence of the colonel and lieutenant
colonel, of leading the regiment to the field.
He commanded the Seventh Regiment at An-
tietam and ui other engagements. Later he
was connni.ssioned Colonel of the First Maine
Veteran Volunteers, and at the age of twenty-
three years he was commander of the Third
Brigade, Second Division, Sixth Army Corps.
He was nmstered out in the summer of 1865,
after four years of gallant service, and was
brevetted Brigadier-general. Later on he re-
ceived from Congress a medal of honor. Re-
turning to Bath, he jnirchased the Warden
Foundrj', which soon, owing to his energy and
business ability, developed into the famous
Bath Iron Works, of which he was president.
He also established the Hyde Windlass Com-
pany.

General Hyde endeared himself to all by his
manly bearing, business integrity, courteous
manner, and cultivated conversation. He was
frequently chosen to fill high political offices in
both city and State. His classical attainments
and literary abilities are evinced in a transla-
tion of some of the odes of Horace, published
by the Bibliophile Society of Boston, and in an
interesting book of reminiscences of the Sixth
Corps, entitled "Following the Greek Cross."
He died greatly mourned in November, 1899.

His wife, Mrs. Annie Hyde, who survives her
husband, was well qualified to be the compan-
ion of such a man. Her father, John Hayden,
was, to (]Uote a newspaper account of him, " an
astronomer, a mathematician, and a profound
scholar." He was one of the early abolition-
ists, and he, too, held some of the highest politi-
cal offices in the city and State. Mrs. Hytle's
mother, Mrs. Martha Brown Hayden, was noted
for her beauty and wit. Mrs. Hyde herself,
finely educated, sympathetic, kindly, of pol-
ished manner, keen intelligence, and gracious
presence, has maintained her position as chate-



laine of Elmhurst, her beautiful home in Bath,
with dignity and happy hospitality. To her
mother's influence Ethel owed much of her
charm of manner and brilliance of conversa-
tion. The relation between Mrs. Hyde and
her children is ideal.

Miss Ethel Hyde went through the usual
routine of the schools in Bath, the instruction
there received being supplemented by private
tuition. At the age of eighteen, with her aunt,
Mrs. Eames, mother of the famous vocalist,
Emma Eames, she went to Europe to "finish
her education," as the expression is, although,
as a fact, her education never was complete.
She was always learning, not satisfied with
that which she had already acquired, but eager
to gain knowledge in all directions. The result
was the possession of a well-balanced, resource-
ful mind, which appreciated the higher im-
pulses of life while not disdaining its lighter
claims. Bles,sed with a fine physique and
graceful in form, she united in her person the
classic requirements of the healthy mind in
the healthy body. She was fond of outdoor
life, and excelled in all athletic exercises. Her
artistic sense was highly developed. This was
characteristically displayed in her love of
flowers, of which the beautiful beds at Elm-
hurst were her especial care. Her fine percep-
tion and good judgment as an amateur of art
were attested by her fine collection of pictures
from European galleries.

But, of all the gifts with which nature had
endowed her, none was more marked than that
of music. It was born in her, inherited to a
large extent from her mother, who is a finished
and artistic musician. Early promise of a
musical voice was detected by the mother, who
fostered and cared for it until the time came
for higher cultivation. Miss Clara Munger, of
Boston, was her first teacher. She subse-
quently studied under Olivieri in Boston and
Madam Picciotto, Van den Heuvel, and Manouri
in Paris. The promise of early tlays was more
than fulfilled. A voice of exquisite beauty and
purity of tone had been trained in the highest
and most artistic method, and a brilliant singer
ai)])eared. Had her ambitions tended in that
direction. Miss Hyde would have won laurels
on the operatic stage; and, indeed, she was



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



97



often urged to devote herself to this career.
Eminent critics who had heard her were unani-
mously of the opinion that she would adorn
the lyric profession. Anton Seidl declaied she
had "a voice of velvet," while Jean de Reszke
pronounced it the best amateur voice he had
ever heard. But her own tastes did not lie in
that way, and she voluntarily gave up an oppor-
tunity that many might covet.

The gift, however, was not hidden; and Miss
Hyde was ranked among the highest of amateur
singers. Not only in her own home, but in
social circles of New York, Boston, Newport,
and Lenox, as well as in Paris, Venice, and
other places abroad, she delighted all who heard
her. In Washington she was a guest of the
British and German Ambassadors, and on more
than one occasion was specially invited to sing
at the White House. In accordance with her
habitual desire of making good use of her ac-
complishments and acting up to the beneficent
instincts of her nature, she devoted her talents
largely to the cause of benevolence and charity.
To this end she frequently organizetl concerts
or gave recitals, in order to be able to minister
to the wants of needy and deserving people,
and there are many to-daj' who owe education
and all that they are to her thoughtful consitl-
eration.

Confirmed in Grace Church, Bath, Miss Hyde
was sincere and unostentatious in her religious
life. The Christian virtues and graces Ijeauti-
fied her character. She took an active part in
church work, and her own parish gratefully
recalls the practical and financial assistance
she renderetl. Thus, adorning her station in
society, pursuing a life of un.selfish goodness,
she was respected and loved by all.

It was in the midst of such a life, so bright
and useful, that Miss Hyde was suddenly
stricken down with incurable disease. Ten-
derly ministered to with all that loving hearts
could supply, for three months she bore her
sufferings with beautiful patience and Christian
fortitude. Then God called her to higher ser-
vice on Sunday, August 27, 1899. On the
twenty-eighth anniversary of her birth all that
was mortal of Ethel Hyde was laid to rest amidst
a sorrow that was universal. Many glowing
tributes have been paid to her memory. The



regard in whidi she was held by those among
whom she lived may be gathered from the
words of her rector at the funeral service,
when, speaking of the wonderful voice, he said,
" It seemed as if it were the very expression of
her life, tuned to a higher key — as all her life
was — sweet, true, pure, inspiring," and from
the opening and closing sentences of an etli-
torial in the local paper: "The entire city
mourns to-day for the sad death of Miss Ethel
Hyde. . . . She will be held in long and grateful
remembrance for her many deeds of charity
and loving kindness."



PAULINE J. WALDEN, LUCY JAME-
SON SCOTT, AND LOUISE MANNING
HODGKINS are officially connected
with the monthly publications of the
Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the
Methodist Eiiisco{)al Church. Miss Walden
may be considered the dean of the journalistic
corps, she having occupied the responsible
jjosition of publisher for more than twenty
years. Mrs. Scott accepted the editorship of
the Children'' s Friend in 1890; and Miss Hodg-
kins, on the occasion of the annual executive
meeting of the society at St. Paul, Minn., in
1893, was elected editor of its official organ,
now known as the Woman's Missionary Friend,
originally the Heathen Woman's Friend. These
publications and two others, Fraueit ifissions
Freund and The Study, are issuetl monthly at
36 Bromfield Street, the Boston office of the
above nanietl society.

The AVoman's Foreign Missionary Society
of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America
was organized in the Treniont Street Methotlist
Episcopal Church, Boston, on a stormy March
day in 1869 by eight women who responded
to a call sent to thirty churches. A window
in the Tremont Street Church commemorates
the event and preserves their names. The
first public meeting of the society was held
in the Bromfield Street Methodist Episcopal
Church, May 26, 1869. The speaking was
quickly followed by decisive action. At a
business meeting held by the women at the
close of the public occasion it was voted to
raise money to send as a missionary to India



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Miss Isabella Thoburn, sister of Bishop Thoburn.
An appeal for a medical woman soon followed.
As a result of prompt and efficient measures
to procure funds, the services of Miss Tho-
burn and of Clara A. Swain, M.D., were secured.
These two women sailed from New York for
India, via England, on November 3, 1869,
reaching their destination early in January,
1870. These first laborers of the new society
in a foreign field were cordially received, and
soon entered upon a good work, Miss Thoburn
organizing schools and superintending the
work of Bible readers, and Dr. Swain's medical
ability gaining for her admission to many places
that w^ere closed to others. This society sent to
India, China, Korea, and Japan the first woman
medical missionary ever received in those
countries. Now, in its thirty-fourth year (1903)
it has two hundred and sixty-five missionaries
carrying on its work in far India, China, Japan,
Korea, Africa, Bulgaria, Italy, South America,
Mexico, and the Philippines, by means of
women's colleges, high schools, seminaries,
hospitals, dispensaries, day schools, and " settle-
ment work," as it is called in America.

The society was incorporated under the laws
of the State of New York in 1884. Its receipts
during the first year were four thousand five
hundred forty-six dollars and eighty-six cents,
and in the year 1903 four hundreil ninety-one
thousand ninety-one dollars and seventy-five
cents, with a total from the beginning of
six million eight hundred and fifty thousand
eight hundred fifty-three dollars. Six Branches
were organized the first year. There are now
eleven, the first the New England, and the
eleventh the Columbia River Branch.

The first number of the society's first peri-
odical, the Heathen Woman's Friend, appeared
in June, 1869. Mrs. Warren, wife of William F.
Warren, D.D., President of Boston University,
was its editor for twenty-four years, be-
ginning at the time when women editors were
so rare as to make the position one of isola-
tion. Financially it was a plunge into the unex-
plored wilderness, there being no money behind
the paper and no influence, except that of a
handful of women whose hearts and brains
were devoted to sending to foreign fields their
first missionaries. But the result proved to



be a financial success, for in thirty years it
not only paid its own expenses, but contributed
over thirty thousand dollars for the publica-
tion and scattering of leaflets and other mis-
sionary literature which has proved to be the
" leaves of the tree for the healing of the na-
tions." Mrs. Warren penned her last editorial,
"The Bugle-call," on Thursday, January 5,
1893, two days before the close of her earthly
life.

Harriet Cornelia Merrick Warren, daugh-
ter of John M. and Mary J. Merrick, was born in
Wilbraham, Mass., September 15, 1843, and
was educated at Wilbraham Academy, of which
her father was a trustee. Married April 14,
1861, to the Rev. William F. Warren, slie went
with him to Bremen, Germany, where he served
for some time as a professor in the Missions-
Anstalt. Possessed of scholarly tastes and
capabilities, Mrs. Warren while abroad con-
tinued to cultivate her mind, successfully pur-
suing advanced studies in history, languages,
literature, music, and art, also spending some
time profitably with her husbantl in travelling.
" She returned after five years a large-minded and
thoroughly ecjuipped woman, full of resources,
and with good practical judgment and tact that
admirably fitted hei' for the position .she was to
occupy as the wife of a man at the head of one
of the most important educational enterprises
in the church and in tlie country." She was
an untiring worker in the Woman's Foreign
Missionary Society, its first recording secretary,
and for years president of the New England
Branch, and an accomplished editor.

Louise Maxning Hodgkins, M.A., Mrs.
Warren's successor in the editorial chair, has
won for herself a name in both literary and
educational fields. Born in Ipswich, Mass.,
August 5, 1846, daughter of Daniel Luiimuis
and Mary (Willett) Hodgkins, she is a descend-
ant of early .settlers of that historic town. P'or
two years in her girlhood she attended the
Ipswich Seminary, then under the charge of
Mrs. Eunice P. Cowles. At Wesieyan Acad-
emy, Wilbraham, where she was next enrolled
as a pupil, she was grailuated in 1870. For
six years (1870-76) she was connected with



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



99



Lawrence University at Appleton, Wis., both as
a teacher and student. She received from the
institution her degree of Master of Arts in 1876.
In 1877, as professor of EngUsh hterature at
\\'ellesley College, she entered upon her next
notable educational work, beginning a term
of efficient antl highly appreciated service,
that lasted fourteen years. The enterprise
was a new one, and upon her devolved the task
of arranging a course of study in her depart-
ment suited to the needs of the times. In 1891
she resigned her professorship, that she might
give her time solely to literary work. She has
been successful both as an author and lecturer.
Among the books that she has written may
be named " Nineteenth Century Authors of
Great Britain and the United States," "Study
of the English Language," and "Via Christi,"
the last a fascinating volume of missionary
annals, published by Macmillan in October,
1902, which in less than two years had reachetl
a sale of nearly fifty thousand copies. Miss
Hodgkins has edited Milton's Lyrics and Mat-
thew Arnold's "Sohrab ami Rustum."

To the Woman'a Missio)iary Friend Miss
Hodgkins, it is said, "has given a fresh impetus
on many lines, and it is not surprising that its
subscription list lengthens each year."

Mi.ss Hodgkins has visited Europe four times
for special studies, attentling lectures at the
College PVan^ais in Paris, studying in the Girls'
Normal School at Hanover and with private
tutors in Leipzig and Berlin, also in the Univer-
sity of Oxford. Her present home is in Auburn-
dale, Mass.

Lucy Amelia J.\meson, now Mrs. Lucy
Jameson Scott, was born in Irasburg, Vt.,
November 27, 1843, daughter of Alexantler
and Sarah (Locke) Jameson. She completed
her school studies at the \''ermont Conference
Seminary, and was graduated as the valedic-
torian of her class. On July 17, 1867, she be-
came the wife of the Rev. Orange W. Scott,
a minister of the Methodist P^piscopal Church.
Soon after the organization of the Woman's
Foreign Missionary Society Mr. Scott was pastor
of a church in Haverhill, Ma.ss. Joining an aux-
iliary, Mrs. Scott served for some time as its
corresponding secretary, later as the first sec-



retary of the New Hampshire Conference.
In 1874 she represented the New England
Branch at the executive committee meeting.
As the years went on, she became more and
more widely known as a worker in the Woman's
Foreign Missionary Society and Woman's Chris-
tian Temperance Union and as a contributor
to the Youth's Companion and other popular
papers, as well as to religious {)eriodicals, also
as a writer of books for Sunday-school libraries.
The latest of her productions is " Twelve
Little Pilgrims," pul)lished by Revell, an in-
teresting story and a valuable book to interest
children in missionary work. Since this writer
of children's books and stories became, in 1890,
editor of the Children s Missionary Friend,
this publication has reached a circulation of
nearly thirty thousand. Time has shown that
she is the right woman in the right place. Mrs.
Scott is the mother of three sons anil two
daughters.

P.\ULiNR J. Walden, chosen at the meeting
in Philadelphia in November, 1882, to succeed
Mrs. Daggett as the publishing agent of the
Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, entered
at once upon the duties of this position. As
publisher of the four periodicals above men-
tioned and general manager of affairs at the
Bromfield Street office, she has shown herself
thoroughly qualified to administer the trusts
committed to her charge, and can perhnps be
best described in the words of a Boston business
man of forty years' experience, "Why, accord-
ing to her opportunity, she's one of the best
business men in the city." She, too, is a New
England woman. Born in Lynn, Mass., she is
of mingled Methodist and Quaker ancestry.
In the simimer of 1897 she visited England
and Europe for the purpose of studying mis-
sionary work, giving considerable time to
the work of the Woman's Foreign Mission-
ary Society in Rome. In the spring and sum-
mer of 1903 she made a tour to the Pacific
coast, visiting California, Oregon, and Washing-
ton, embracing the Columbia River and Pacific
Branches of the Woman's Foreign Missionary
Society, in the interests of the work. The total
monthly output of the four periodicals is now
(December, 1903) over ninety-five thousand.

with eighty-eight thousand nine hundred sev-
enty-six paid subscriptions. Miss Waldcn, witli
her genial manners and her cheering business
budget, has been a welcome official visitor at
annual executive committee meetings. With
her clear head, her lofty aims, and earnest
spirit, she is an appreciated force in the Woman's
Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church.



GULIELMA PENN SANBORN was
born in Readfield, Me., February 20,
1839, a daughter of Samuel and
Joanna (Pierce) Sanborn. Among
her ancestors on both sides were some who
held responsible jiositions in early colonial life
and some who served in the war for indepen-
dence. She is therefore eligible to membership
in the Daughters of the American Revolution
and the Society of Colonial Dames. Miss San-
born accjuired her elementary education in
the little red school-house of the district in
which she lived. Her family moving to the
suburbs of Augusta when she was ten years
old, she had a few yeai's of such teaching as
the country schools then afforded. During this
time she had plenty of good books anfl news-
papers to read at home.

Stress of circvmistances sent each child of
the household as a wage-earner, and at the age
of fourteen the cotton-mill in Augusta became
the scene of her labors. Wearying of the
monotony' and small pay in that locality, she
went to Lawrence, Mass., where she was em-
ployed in the Pacific Print Works. The free
library connected with this place afforded Miss
Sanborn the greatest pleasure. She speaks
enthusiastically of the benefits derived from
its use.

The year LS61 found her at home in Augusta
with her mother and the younger children, as
the men had all "gone to the war." For a few
months she worked on soldiers' coats; but this
labor was not satisfactory, and plans were marie
for learning type-setting, then a comparatively
new business for women. With fair success
this occu|)ation was followed for five years,
when failing health compelled its abandon-
ment. Circumstances opened a way for sew-



ing. Orders were received from the best and
most influential families, among them the
Blaines. Mr. Blaine was Speaker of the House
at Washington in 1872; and Mrs. Blaine, need-
ing some one to accompany her thither, as
family assistant in various ways, proffered the
situation to Miss Sanborn, who welcomed the
[ileasant change. This proved a most delight-
ful winter, as the generous and kindly ways
of the family accorded her many privileges not
usually vouchsafed to an employee. She went
everywhere, saw everybody and everything
worth .seeing, joining the family at their table
and meeting their guests, a bit of education
novel and broad. At the end of the session
Mr. and Mrs. Blaine gave her a pass from Balti-
more to California and return. She left at
once for the sunny land. Making her home
there with a brother and finding immediate
emi)loyment at her trafle, she earned enough
to travel the length and l)readth of that State,
visiting among other places of note the Yo-
semite Valley and the big trees. She made these
journeys on horseback, after the manner of
those days. In October of the same year she
s))ent three months in the frontier .settlements of
Kansas, and tarried in several other States,
reaching Maine in the early part of 1873. In
March she opened dressmaking rooms, with
dreams of the Centennial in her mind, a dream
that was realized and so thoroughly enjoyed
that the larger plan for attending the Paris
P]xposition in 1878 seemed feasible. As her
aged parents on the farm were then in comfort-
able circumstances, the trip was taken; and the
three and a half months in England, Scot-
land, and France were a never-to-be-forgotten
pleasure.

Craving something beyond the walls of her
busy dressmaking establishment, and having
no special journey in view, in 1880 she took up
the Chautauqua literary and scientific course of
study by correspondence. Working busily in
her rooms all day, this meant study for e^'enings
and Sundays. In 1884 the two weeks' vacation
found her at Chautauciua ready to be grad-
uated in a class numbering fourteen hundred.
Dr. Lyman Abbott delivered the address and
awarded the ilijilomas. In this immense class
Miss Sanborn ranked well.

Again application to business imtil her father
and mother neede(^l her personal attention. In
1891 she bought a beautiful home on a high
hill in Augusta, which she named "Ren Venue."
Here her parents came from the lonely farm to
live with her, and here, when the summons
came, they "lay down to pleasant dreams."

For the past ten years, having built green-
houses, she has carried on a most successful
florist's business. Each year she has done
something to improve the land and surround-
ings, not the least of her enterprises being the
drilling of an artesian well, five hundred antl
sixty feet deep, and the erection of a tower,
tank, and windmill, the whole costing not less
than three thousand dollars.

Miss 8anborn was a pioneer in the ten-hour
system for working women, being the first to
run her business on that rule. In all ways
she has tried to better the condition of wage-
earning women. Busy as she is, she has been
active in W. C. T. U. work, has been a club
woman since the birth of clubs, and a tower of
strength in the Sunday-school and church. She
counts it among her greatest privileges that
she has been favored with the opportunity of
listening to cultivated and eminent preachers,
as the Rev. Drs. A\'ebb, and iMcKenzie, Bing-
ham, Ecob, and others.

Looking back upon a long and busy life, that
has been a happy one, she is still actively en-
gaged as a florist, and cherishes the hope that
her declining years may be useful, heli)ful to
others, and not a burden to herself.

Miss Gulielma P. Sanborn joined Koussinoc
Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion, in the autumn of 1902, and has since joined
the National Society of that patriotic order,
her application for membership in the latter
having been accepted by the board of manage-
ment in Washington, D.C., April 27, 1903,
and her name placed on the list of members.
Her eligibility in these two instances, as well
as her qualifications for uniting with the So-
ciety of Colonial Dames, comes from the pub-
lic services of some of her maternal ancestors,
briefly recorded below.

Miss Sanborn's parents, Samuel Sanborn, of
Yarmouth (born May 17, 1806, died February
11, 1893), and Joanna Pierce, of Westbrook,



Me., were married in 1828. They had eight
children — Elizabeth Dunbar, Joiseph Pierce,
Albion Irving, Gulielma Penn (the subject of
this sketch), Thomas Tristram, Samuel Porter
Elwell, Benjamin Franklin, and Cora Frances —
the eldest born in Westbrook in 1830, and the
youngest in Augusta in 1855. The four now
living are Albion and Porter in California,
Gulielma in Augusta, and Cora near Boston.
Albion and Thomas served in the Civil War
as third assistant engineers on gunboats in the
navy.

The mother, Mrs. Joanna Pierce Sanborn,
who dietl October 13, 1895, was born in West-
brook, Me., November 29, 1810, daughter of
Thomas and Elizabeth (Storer) Pierce and a
descendant in the seventh generation of Daniel
Pierce, of Newbury, Mass. The Pierce line
is: Daniel,'^ Benjamin,' Thomas,^ the Rev.
Thomas,^ Thomas," Joanna.'

Daniel' Pierce, the immigrant progenitor
of this branch of the Pierce family, joining the
Massachusetts Bay Colony at an early date,
resided for three or four years in Watertown,
and about the year 1638 removed to Newbury,
Mass., where he died in 1677.

DanieP Pierce served as Deputy from New-
bury to Massachusetts General Court, 1682-83;
member of the Council of Safety, 1689; Rep-
resentative to General Court, 1692; Councillor,
1693-1703; Judge of the Court of Common
Pleas for the county of Essex, 1698-1703. He
was made Captain of the NeA'bury foot com-
pany, October 7, 1678, and appointed Colonel
of the Second Essex County Regiment soon after
the organization of the Provincial government
under the new charter in 1692. He died in
1704.

Benjamin' Pierce, born in February, 1668-9,
son of Colonel Daniel, resided in Newbury.
He married Lydia Frost (born in 1674), daugh-
ter of Major Charles^ Frost, of Kittery, Me.,
by his wife, Mary Bolles.

Thomas* Pierce, born in 1706, son of Benja-
min and Lydia, married in February, 1732-3,
Abigail Frost, born in 1712, daughter of Lieu-
tenant Charles' Frost (son of Major Frost) and
his wife, Sarah Wainwright. The Rev. Thomas^
Pierce, born in Newliury in 1737, was ordained
in Newbury as a Presbyterian minister in Sep-

tember, 1762, and settled as pastor of the
church in Scarboro, Me., where he died in 1775.
Coffin mentions him as a graduate of Harvard
in 1759, evidently an error, as his name is not
in the college catalogue. He probably studied
at Harvard for a time before going to Cilouces-
ter, Mass., where he taught school previous
to entering the ministry, and where he found
his wife, Anna Haskell, whom he married in
November, 1762. She was the daughter of
Captain William^ Ha.skell, of Gloucester, the
fourth of the name in direct line. William'
Haskell, the immigrant progenitor, settled in
Gloucester. He was made Lieutenant of the
train-band in 1661, and afterward was Cap-
tain. In 1672 and in several later years he
served as Representative to General Court.

Thomas" Pierce, born in October, 1763, son
of the Rev. Thomas and his wife Anna, mar-
ried about 1783 Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph
and Joanna (Graves) Storer, of Westbrook,
then Falmouth, Me. Of this union were born
eleven children, Joanna, who became the wife
of Samviel Sanborn, as recorded above, being
the youngest.

Major Charles^ Frost, father of Lydia, the
wife of Benjamin Pierce, was born in England,
and came to this country with his father, Nich-
olas Frost, in 1634. He was killed by Indians
in 1697, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He
served as Deputy from Kittery to Massachu-
setts General Court in 1658 and in five later
years. He was commissioned Captain in July,
1668; was made Commander-in-chief of the
military forces of Maine, with the title of Ser-
geant Major, in August, 1689; and served as a
Councillor or Assistant, 1693-97.

Sarah Wainwright, wife of Lieutenant
Charles' Frost and mother of Abigail, wife of
Thomas* Pierce, was daughter of Captain Simon
Wainwright, of Haverhill. Her father com-
manded a garrison during the Indian troubles,
and was slain in an attack on the town, August
29, 1708. His wife was Sarah Gilbert.

Joseph Storer, of Falmouth, father of Eliza-
beth, Miss Sanborn's maternal grandmother,
was a soldier of the Revolution. He enlisted
for three years in the latter part of 1776, but
tiled at Fishkill, in the State of New York, in
1777. In the Revolutionary Rolls of Massa-



chusetts, in the State archives, "Joseph Storer:
Appears in a list of men raised to serve in
the Continental Army from Col. Peter Noyes's
(1st Cumberland Co.) regt. Town belonged
to, Falmouth. Town enlisted for, Falmouth.
Term of enlistment, 3 years. Joined Capt.
Blaisdeir§ co.. Col. Wigglesworth's regt." (vol.
xHii. 43 c).

Again: "Joseph Storer: Appears with
rank of Corporal on Continental Army Pay
Accounts of Capt. Smart's co.. Col. Smith's
regt., for service from Jan. 6, 1777, to July
19, 1777. Residence, Falmouth. Reported,
'died.'" (Vol. xiii., part 1, p. 152.) Lieu-
tenant Colonel Smith succeeded Colonel Wig-
glesworth.

Joseph Storer was survived by his wife Jo-
anna, whom he married in Falmouth in 1764.
Nearly half a century after his death, in accord-
ance with a resolve passed by the Legislature
of Maine in March, 1835, entitled a "Resolve
in favor of certain officers and soldiers of the
Revolutionary War, and the widows of the
deceased officers and soldiers," and in answer
to her application made in June, 1835, Joanna
Storer received a grant of State bounty land.
She lived to the age of ninety-nine years and
three months.



J4NNE WHITNEY, Boston's most noted
/ \ woman sculptor, is a native of Water-
X JL town, Mass. The daughter of Na-
thaniel Ruggles Whitney, Jr., and his
wife, vSarah Stone, she was born on September
2, 1821, the youngest of a family of seven chil-
dren. Her father was a lineal descendant
in the seventh generation of John Whitney,
a native of Westminster, England, who set-
tled in Watertown in 1635.

As revealed by genealogical research, John
Whitney was the third son of Thomas and Mary
(Bray) Whitney, and was baptized July 26,
1592. Thomas Whitney, his father, was buried
in St. Margaret's, Westminster, April 14, 1637.
He was a son of Robert Whitney and grand-
son of Sir Robert Whitney, member of Parlia-
ment in 1559. "The Ancestry of John Whit-
ney," compiled by Henry Melville and pub-
lished in 1896, mentions the names of heads

of Whitney families in England for fourteen
generations, tracing; the line of John of Water-
town and his father, Thomas of Westminster,
England, back to a Sir Robert de Witteneye,
living in 1242, who is spoken of by Mr. Mel-
ville as the "first historic \Vhitney."

From John Whitney, the English immigrant,
and his wife Elinor, to Anne, the American
sculptor, the line was continued through John,
Jr.,^ Benjamin,' Daniel,^ Simon,^ Nathaniel
Ruggles," and Nathaniel Ruggles, Jr.,' the
father above named.

Daniel' Whitney married Dorothy, daughter
of Deacon Simon and Joanna (Stone) Tainter,
of Watertown. Simon'^ Whitney marrietl Mary
Ruggles. Nathaniel Ruggles Whitney, born
in 1759, served as Town Clerk of Watertown,
Justice of the Peace, anil schoolmaster. His
wife, Abigail Frothingham, born in 1760, was
a daughter of James° and Abigail (Bradish)
Frothingham, of Charlestown, and aunt to
the artist, James Frothingham, third of the
name, born in 1788, who ranked seventy years
ago as "one of our best portrait painters,"
being thus mentioned by Dunlap in 1834.

Nathaniel R. Whitney, Jr., born in 1782,
married in 1806 Sally (or Surah) Stone, who
was born in 1784. Her father, Jonathan Stone,
of Watertown, Miss Whitney's paternal grand-
father, was a descendant in the fifth genera-
tion of Deacon Simon Stone, who came from
England with his wife Joan and four children
in the ship "Increa.se" in the spring of 1635,
and, settling at Watertown, became the founder
of a prominent branch of the Stone family
in New England. The record of the baptism
of Deacon Simon Stone, of Watertown, has
been found in the parish register of Much Brom-
ley, now Great Bromley, Essex County, Eng-
land, thus: "1585-6, 9 Feb., Simond, son of
Davie Stone &amp; Ursly his wife." His marriage
record, also at Much Bromley, is as follows:
" 1616, 5 Aug. Symond Stone and Joan Clarke."

To return now to Miss Whitney, the sculptor.
Twenty years ago, hi a book on " Famous
Women," appeared a sketch of the life of Anne
Whitney, which, though incomplete, later
biographers and paragraphists writing on the
same subject have failed to surpass in sympa-
thetic flelineation of character and achieve-



ment. "Fortunate in her parentage and in
her early training," says this sketch, "Anne
Whitney passed through childhood and youth
into womanhood under most favorable condi-
tions. The simplicity and nobility of nature
which strongly marked the parents are traits
in the daughter, as are their individualism,
their strength of character, their loftiness of
moral tone. She has also inherited an inter-
est in public affairs and reform, an uncon-
querable aversion to any and every form of in-
justice, and a vital belief in human betterment."

"As a child she was bright and joyous, over-
flowing with animal spirits." In the school-
room she was a general favorite. "Said one
of her teachers, 'She always brought in with
her such a sense of freshness and purity that
instinctively I thought of the coming in of the
morning. Every teacher in the school observed
her, anil all rejoiced in her. ... A gentle grav-
ity, a .sweet intelligence of infrequent speech,
or a pervasive kindliness of manner marked
her intercourse with her fellow-students, it
being always apparent that she was with, but
not of, them.'"

Slowly her girlhood pas.sed into womanhood.
With soul growth came new susceptibility
to outward impressions, whether of beauty and
of joy, or of sorrow and pain, while far above
the possibility of attainment soared her cher-
ished ideals. Fortunately the gift of expres-
sion was not denied. She wrote as prompted-
from within, wrote as the spirit gave utterance.
\ modest volume of poems, published in 1859,
was the result. Poems of "remarkable qual-
ity," says Mrs. Livermore. Not that they made
their author famous: rather may it be said,
"Fit audience they found, though few." It
was Samuel Johnson, himself a poet in the
same order, who wrote of them, "They send
the repose of absolute truth and spiritual in-
tuition through the aspirations and conflicts
of life, and give us its poetry and highest philos-
ophy."

An extended critique, both admiring and
judicial, appeared in the North Avierican Re-
view, contributed l)y Harriet Prescott Spofford.
"The publishers," she remarks, "did not give
it [the book] their best style. The advertise-
ment was limited, the criticism casual. . . .

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



'Earnest' and 'thoughtful' have been the only
adjectives to spare. Earnest and thoughtful!
What verses, if otherwise, would deserve a
notice? Was there no more to say for poems
overflowing with beauty, serene and calm, yet
instinct with the fire of a proud, passionate
nature? . . . But neither keen eye nor sym-
pathetic h(\art makes a poet. ... A lyrical
and tlramatic power is needed, together with
that sway over language which welds a fancy
immutably into its own sentences. This last
the author has in the highest degree: every
word strikes home; every line is clear, distinct
as if cut in stone ; the pen in her hands becomes
so like the sculptor's chisel that one questions
if poetrj' be the fittest exponent of her genius.
Her logical power is entirely beyond question,
but the dramatic element is entirely wanting. ' '
"A Last Dream," the dream of an arctic hero —
Kane — is characterized as a "wonderful poem,
which climbs with strong and stately steps to
the last line."

"The 'Hymn to the Sea' is full of felicitous
phrasing, also rich in picturesque effects. That
this Hymn loses no jot of its regal resonance
in the presence of its subject, but interprets
and is interpreted best there, is its highest
praise. It is certainly the finest single piece
among the poems, though 'Camille' (first pub-
lished in the Atlantic, vol. i.) affects us more,
from its warmer hvmianity and the better de-
veloped power it exhibits. There is no fault
to be found with 'Camille.' It is the work of
an artist. Its pathos is unsurpassed. . . . The
keynote of this poem is struck most clearly
in the fourth stanza: —

" 'To .swell some vast refrain beyond the sun,
The very weed breathed niiLsic from its sod:
And night and day, in ceaseless antiphon,

Rolled off throiigh windless arches in the broad
Abyss. Thou saw'st I too
Would in my place have blent accord as true,
And justified this great enshrining, (JodP

"The three chief faults of these poems are
obscurity, lack of euphony, and defect of ar-
tistic polish." However, "there are no words
woven to conceal the absence of thought: on
the other hand, the line teems with more sig-
nificance than it can express. . . . We ovight



in justice to say that the artist's soul is keenly
representetl, especially in the 'Five Sonnets
Relating to Beauty,' most worthily so entitletl.
In these the love of beauty is a passion. ... In
beauty is found the reconciliation of pain and
jov, the riddle of the earth, the secret of the
sea."

Referring to the sonnets entitled "Niglit"
as "the heart of the book": "All through the
preceding pages has rvm the golden cord on
which the.se gay, many-colored beads are strung
— a pure, high, and profounil religious love. . . .
A truth, never so keenly felt as at the present
day, revolves in all its phrases here — the ne-
cessity of joy in faith, the (luintessence of the
text, 'Rejoice evermore.' "

Higher attainments in verse were looked for
by Miss Whitney's friends, but, so far as the
world knows, she had sung her last note. Her
genius called her in another direction. A heap
of wet sand in the greenhouse responded to
a thought in her brain to which she at once sought
to give visible form. The success of this at-
tempt at modelling was so gratifying that she
resolved to devote herself thenceforth to sculpt-
ure. For a long time, in the absence of teach-
ers, .she was self-taught.. Working at home
in a studio in the garden, she made portrait
busts of her father and mother and of several
friends. Her first ideal work was a statue
in marble of Lady Godiva of Coventry, a beau-
tiful figure. Her next creation — during the
period of the Civil War— was a symbolical
work, "Africa," a colossal statue of a woman
who has been sleeping for ages, and is now
half-awakened by the tramj) of armies, the roar
of artillery, and the din of battle. In her look
of startled wonder and hope, as with her right
hand she shades her eyes from the too power-
ful light, is foreshadowed the deliverance of
a race held in bondage, the illumination of a
dark continent. Exhibited both in Boston
and in New York, "it received," says Mrs.
Livermore, "some intelligent and some ex-
travagant praise, as did the Godiva, and also
much criticism, which its a\ithor welcomed."

Not long after the production of a third
statue, the "Lotos P]ater," she carried out
a long-cherished plan of going abroad. With
her friend Miss Manning, devoted to another



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



105



branch of art, she spent four years in Europe,
studying ancient sculpture, drawing, and mod-
elling, chiefly in Rome and Paris. In this
period she made many sketches and modelled
several statues, among them the " Chaldean
Astronomer," "Toussaint L'Ouverture," and
"Roma." In the latter Miss Whitney personi-
fied the Rome of Pio Nono's time, "Childless
and crownless in her voiceless woe," a beggar
"whose aged and wrinkletl face shows traces
of early, majestic beauty. She sits on a broken
Corinthian capital, with lier head bowed in
profound reverie."

After her return, with increased technical
skill, enlarged conceptions of art, and the in-
spiration born of years of contact and com-
munion with the great masterpieces of the
world, Miss Whitney resumed her work in the
studio, and continued to design and motlel.
She executed several conmiissions for portrait
busts, which gave entire satisfaction to the
large constituencies interested. Among the.se
were busts of President Stearns of Amherst
College, President Walker of Harvard, of Gar-
rison, of the poet Keats, of Mrs. Livermore,
Lucy Stone, Alice Freeman Palmer, and many
others. One of her best works is the statue
of the Revolutionary patriot, Samuel Adams,
which she was commissioned by the State of
Massachusetts to execute for the National Gal-
lery in Washington, D.C. Of this statue a
reproduction in bronze was ordered for the
city of Boston; and, having been put in place,
it gave the name to Adams S(|uare.

Of later date is Miss Whitney's portrait
statue of Harriet Martineau, representing her
in the prime of life, sitting in a garden chair,
her face raised, her thought far-reaching. This
statue was exhibited in Boston in 1888, and
is now at Wellesley College.

An ideal figure in bronze, commended as
a "work of rare genius in physical detail," and
a "notable addition to the put:)lic decorations
of the city" of Boston, is that of Leif l&lt;]ric.son,
standing on the edge of Back Bay Fens, just
beyond Commonwealth Avenue parkway.
The dedication of this statue, on October 29,
1887, was an occasioii of rare interest. At
a meeting in Faneuil Hall, ])resided over by
Dr. Edward Everett Hale, a scholarlv address



relating to the Norscnicn and their tliscover-
ies was given by Professor E. N. Horsford.

The statue of Leif Ericson is of heroic size.
It stands on a pedestal of red sandstone, being
about eighteen feet in height. The figure is
symbolical. It represents a youth gazing ea-
gerly at the distant horizon, his left hand par-
tially shading his eyes, not from the light on
sea or land to-tlay, but from the glory of the
futui'e, as he dimly forecasts the events of com-
ing centuries in the new land that meets his
vision. The inscription on one side of the
pedestal, giving the date of the voyage of Leif
the tliscoverer, is in runic characters. On
the opposite side it is in English. A replica
of this statue is in Milwaukee on the shore of
Lake Michigan.

A later production, a statue of Charles Sum-
ner, in sitting posture, completed about three
years ago, has received the recognition of
critics. It is in Cambridge.

St' 11 more recent is a bronze fountain in
memory of a woman of rare beauty of character
— Mrs. Catherine Lambert — which was put in
place in West Newton in September, 1903. A
HI}' held in the upraised hands of a sturdy
little cherub is the cup whence issues the spark-
ling spray.

Mi.ss \Vhitney took up her residence in Bo.s-
ton in 1872. For a number of years she had
her home and her studio at 92 Mount Vernon
Street. She is now in the locality designated
as the "New Back Bay," where, in a smaller
studio than the former one, the sculptor's
chi.sel still displacing the long-discarded pen,
her high poetic thought continues to find its
truest expression. m. h. g.

He was bom in Thornton, N.H., in 1791, a son

Gerrish family, to which his mother and his
wife belonged, was founded by Captain William'
Gerrish, who came to Newbury, Mass., with
Percival Lowle (Lowell). Stephen Smith,
father of Foster, was a soldier of the Revolu-

of New Hampshire.

Baroness Posse's maternal grandparents were
John and Catherine (Moore) Ballou (name
legally changed from Bullough), the grand-
mother belonging to the Moore family of Sud-
bury, Mass., dating from early colonial times.
John Ballou was son of Joseph and Abigail
(Symmes) Bullough, of Newton, Mass. Joseph
Bullough is spoken of in Vinton's "Symmes
Memorial" as "a native of England and a man
of large property." Abigail Symmes, whom
he married in 1774 (Mnton), was daughter
of Zechariah^ Synnnes, of Charlcstown. Her
father was son of the Rev. Thomas' Symmes
and great-grandson of the Rev. Zechariah'
Symmes (a graduate of Emmanuel College,
Cambridge University), who came to New
England in 1634, and was for many years
pastor of the church in Charlestown.

Rose M. Smith was educated in the Newbury-
port public schools and at the State Normal
School in Salem. After her graduation she
taught Latin and French in a fashionable pri-
vate school in Philadelphia until her marriage.
Possessing an excellent contralto voice, she
gave much time to music, and studied under
leading teachers in this country and abroad.
While in Philadelphia she sang in one of the
church choirs, and after removing to Boston
sang in one of the churches until 1900. During
the summer of 1885 she travelled in Europe for
pleasure, and it was in England that she first
met Baron Posse, who was on his way to Amer-
ica. The friendship then begun was continued
in this country, and in 1887 they were married
and settled in Boston.

Baron Nils Posse, K.G.V., M.G., born in
Stockholm in 1862, came of a noble Swedish
family whose history dates l^ack fully one
thousand years. His father was Baron Knut
Henrik Posse, K.S., Governor of the Artillery



and Engineering School of the Swedish army
and Major of the First Field Artillery. His
mother was Lady Sophia Lilliestrole, of an-
cient Swedish nobility. In 1880 he was grad-
uated from a Swedish college with a degree equiv-
alent to Bachelor of Science in America, and
fourteen months later was graduated with high
honors from the Military Academy. Brevetted
by the King as a Lieutenant in the Life Grena-
diers in 1881, he was transferred to the Field
Artillery with the same rank in 1883. While
in the army he took his first yearly course at
the Royal Gynmastic Central Institute, com-
pleting his training at the expiration of his
military service, and receiving his diploma in
1885. In 1884 he was assistant in the Medico-
Gymnastic Department of the Institute, also
an instructor in the Stockholm Gymnastic and
Fencing Club; and from 1881 to 1885 he was
an active member in the Stockholm Gymnastic
Association, the leading organization of its
kind in that country. Before he left Sweden
he was an instructor in the army as well as in
the public schools.

Coming to America in 1885, he settled per-
manently in Boston, and for three years prac-
tised medical gymnastics exclusively. The out-
growth of a normal class in Swedish gymnastics,
of which he was asked to take charge in 1886,
is the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics,
for whose estal^lishment he was largely indebted
to the assistance of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, the
well-known philanthropist. Of this school the
Baron was director until January 1, 1890.

In February, 1890, he opened a gymnasium
of his own in the Harcourt Building, on Irving-
ton Street. This was the small beginning of
the Posse Gynmasium, which at the time of
the founder's death had over five hundred
pupils, and, with its three departments, peda-
gogical, educational, and medico-gymnastic,
its complete apparatus and appointments,
adapted to Swedish and other forms of gym-
nastics, anthropometric e.xercises, fencing, danc-
ing, anil so forth, and its comprehensive cur-
riculum, has come to be recognized as one of
the finest in the country. His useful activities,
however, were not confined to the gymnasium.
He not only found time to make translations
from famous Swedish authors on gymnastics

and kindred subjects and contribute articles
to papers and magazines, but wrote several
valuable text-books on physical education,
among these being " Special Kinesiology of
Educational Gynmastics," "Handbook of
School Gymnastics," "The Scientific Aspect of
Swedish Gymnastics," "Columl)ian Essays on
Swedish Gymnastics," "Medical Gymnastics."

The Journal of Education, in a notice of one
of his books, spoke of Baron Posse as having
come to this country bringing the gospel of
the Ling system of educational gynmastics,
and said, " We do not recall any man of any
land who has taken sucli a hold of the teachers
and friends of education in Boston as has
Baron Nils Posse. Through his judicious, un-
ostentatious introduction of physical culture,
that subject has been advanced as far in a few
months as manual training, for instance, in as
many years."

In 1890-91 Baron Posse was lecturer on medi-
cal gymnastics to the McLean Asylum and in
1890 to the New England Hospital for Women.
He w as a member of the Council of the American
Association for the Advancement of Physical
Education; and at the World's Columbian Ex-
position in Chicago he was vice-president of
the Congress of Physical Education, also Swed-
ish Commissioner of the Tourists' Dei)artnient,
Gynmastics and Sports, and was awarded
medals for his method of instruction. Boston
honored him similarly in 1892, and Antwerp
in 1894. In October, 1893, he was placetl in
charge of the medico-gymnastic clinic in the
Boston Dispensary.

On May 15, 1895, his thirty-third birthday,
he received from the King of Sweden a decora-
tion of a class never before issued to so young
a man — that of Knight of Gustavus Vasa,
which is bestowed only on those who have
brought honor to their native land through
special merit or industry.

His untimely death, December 18, 1895,
from thrombus, the result of u long periotl of
over-taxation of his strength, occasioneil wide-
spread sorrow, and calleti forth many warm
appreciations of his work and character. Said
the Boston Journal: " Baron Nils Posse was of
the type of nobleman that America likes best.
He was an earnest and successful worker, and



leaves behind a record of having accomplished
something and of having done the world some
good, and both through his own individual
efforts."

The estimate of one who knew him appeared
in the Herald, in part as follows: "To every
life with whom he came in contact he was a
source of inspiration and courage. Such kind-
ness was mixed with his sterling qualities, in-
tegrity, fearlessness, and steadfastness, that he
won and held the deepest heart affection, as
well as the highest respect of all who knew him
peisonally. He had spent only ten short years
of professional work, but those years marked
achievement sufficient for a lifetime."

Baroness Posse, who was attending RadciifTe
College, at once gave uj) her studies and assumed
the management of the gymnasium, her one
idea being that her husband's life-work must
be carried on. The pupils, when they returned
from their Christmas vacation, fintling her in
charge, showed their loj^alty by remaining.
The alumni and friends of the school foinied
themselves into the Posse Memorial Associa-
tion. Their object was to purchase the name
and good will of the Posse Gymnasium, to re-
organize it, and to incorporate it under the
name of the Posse Institute of Gynmastics.
They were to raise a sum of money sufficient to
place the school on a firm basis, its future wel-
fare to be guarded by a board of trustees.

During that summer Baroness Posse took
her husband's remains to Sweden. She re-
turned in August to find the affairs of the Memo-
rial A,ssociation in a chaotic condition and a
certain faction talking of opening an iutlepen-
(lent school. After brief (leliljeration she de-
cided to continue the school under her own
management. In the two weeks that inter-
vened before it was to open, an almost incred-
ible amount of work was acconiplisheil ; new
teachers were engagetl and some of the old ones
re-engaged, and the gymnasium itself was put
in repair. On the day and hour appointed, the
rc-organized school opened with the largest
senior class on record, anel a large entering
class. The Memorial Association clevoted the
larger portion uf the funds in the treasury to
erecting a monument over Baron Po.sse's grave
in Stockholm, Sweden. The balance of the



108

money was spent in purchasing a picture which
was hung in the gynniasium. The school con-
tinued under the new management with unvaried
success until the fall of 1900, when the old
rooms on Irvington Street were exchanged for
new and improved cjuarters at 206 Massachu-
setts Avenue. The continued success of the
gymnasium is proof of the executive ability of
its manager, who for over seven years has
carried on the work with such results as to
maintain the reputation first established of
being one of the leading normal schools of
Swedish gymnastics in the country. Every
graduate of this school is now occupying a good
position.

Baroness Posse is also interested in litei'ary
and philanthropic work and in nuisic. Since
December, 1892, she has edited the Posse G^jm-
nasium Jourrial, which is the only paper of the
sort in the country, and has been self-supporting
from the start. This paper has been conducted
under her sole management for over ten years.
It is taken by most of the State university
libraries, and it has subscribers in England,
France, Germany, and Sweden. The Baroness
has delivered lectures liefore leading educational
societies and clubs in Boston and suburbs. Al
one time she gave a talk on Swedish Gymnastics
before an educational body in London. For
years she held an office in the Working Girls'
Club, to which she devoted much time. She
also assisted in college settlement work.

For a number of years she was the ])resident
of the Literary Club of the Posse Gynmasium,
a club composed of about four hundred mem-
bers, which gave several plays with success.
She has served on various educational conunit-
tees, and was first vice-president of the Boston
Physical Education Society from 1896 to 1900,
when she resigned to accept the office of secre-
tary of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Physical Education. She has
recently been appointed vice-president of the
Physical Education Department of the National
Education Association. For several years she
was chairman of the Hygiene Committee of
the Women's Educational and Industrial Union.
She is a member of the Longwood Cricket CIuli,
of the Commonwealth Golf Club, in which she
held offices, and is vice-president of the Mas-



sachusetts Medical Gymnastic Society. The
Baroness is very popular socially, and has a
large circle of friends.



A NNIE ANDROS HAWLEY, librettist

/\ and musical composer, the wife of
X A. George Hawley, was born in Cam-
bridge, Mass., being the daughter of
Henry Sanford and Adelaide Eleanor (Little)
Andros. On her father's side she is descended
from the well-known Andros family of Connecti-
cut, one of her direct ancestors having been
Benjamin Andros, of Norwich, who was prom-
inent in State and town affairs about the middle
of the eighteenth century.

Mrs. Hawley's musical talent comes by in-
heritance from both her parents. Her father,
the late Henry Andros, was endowed by nature
with a rarely sweet tenor voice, and was, more-
over, a thorough musician by education and
training. For thirty consecutive years he filled
the position of choirmaster of St. Peter's Epis-
copal Church in Cambridge, being the incum-
bent of that position until within two years of
the time of his death, which occurred suddenly
in August, 1902.

Mrs. Hawley's mother is a grand-daughter of
Captain Abraham Shackleton, of Nottinghanr,
England, who was an officer in the Oxford
Blues, and fought under Wellington at the
battle of Waterloo. An accomplished musician,
Mrs. Andros has been organist at St. Peter's
ever since her hasband began his directorship,
and since his death has filled the dual office of
organist and chorister. She is also a teacher
of sight reading and harmony, and a successful
trainer of men's voices.

Mrs. Hawley's native musical talent was
carefully fostered by her parents, she receiving
from an early age competent instruction in
vocal and instrumental music as well as in
harmony. Her general education was obtained
in the public schools of Cambridge and at
Radcliffe College, which she entered soon after
graduating from the English High School.
Her literary ability was early displayed in the
writing of lyrics, which were soon followed by
the words and nmsic of plays. The first work
by which she became publicly known was a

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



109



musical comedy entitled "The Dove's Supper,"
which was first given at the Bijou Theatre
in 1896. This was afterward enlai'ged and
changed to "A Social Escapade," and given at
the Tremont Theatre. Some of her most at-
tractive songs have been widely sung by some
of the best known comic opera stars before the
public. "The Potentate," a comic opera of
which she wrote the libretto, lyrics, and music,
was chosen by the Algonquin Club of Brockton
out of fifty submitted to them for production
in February, 1903. The piece was given a
large and costly production, and received
much enthusiastic commendation. The num-
ber of comic opera writers has long been so
small that for a number of years all the comic
0]ieras produced have been the work of a very
few men. Thus enterprising managers hail
with delight the advent of this young authoress
and composer. Her work is attracting the at-
tention of some of the most prominent mana-
gers in the country.

Mr. and Mrs. Hawley reside in Winchester.

Mr. Hawley is a choir director of Boston, and
himself a fine singer. For a mmiber of years
previous to her marriage, which took place in
April, 1897, Mrs. Hawley played 'cello in the
"Fadettes" (women's orchestra), and she is
still a valued member of that organization,
though her many duties deter her from often
playing with them. She possesses a rich so-
prano voice, and is an advanced pui)il of Mme.
Gertrude Franklin Salisbury. She has done
much church and concert singing, and her
voice has both flexibility and compass. She
is, without doubt, the only womrm before the
public who is both a librettist and a musical
composer. With her ambition, talent, and in-
dustry, a brilliant future seems to be assured
her.



CLARA EMERETTE GARY-vM.D., was
born in Mitldlesex, Vt., a daughter of
Ephraim and Sarah A. (Robinson)
Gary. When she was six years old,
her parents removed from Middlesex to Mont-
pelier, \"t., eight miles distant, where she spent
her childhood days. At- an early age she gave
evidence of her mental bent, prophetic of her



future career, manifesting a great interest in
medical and surgical subjects, experimenting
on the broken legs of fowls, and improving every
opportunity of gaining a knowledge of the heal-
ing processes of nature. She was educated in
the public schools of Montpelier, including the
high school, and at the Montpelier Seminary.
In accortlance with the desire of her parents,
she then engaged in teaching, but after a while,
having become dissatisfied with her acquire-
ments, she entered the School of Cognate Lan-
guages at Morgan Park, near Chicago, 111.,
where she studied untler the direction of Profes-
sor W. R. Harper, now the President of Chicago
University.

About this time occurred the death of her
father and eldest brother, William H. Gary,
and under the severe mental strain occasioned
by the double bereavement her health gave way,
anil she was prostrated by a severe illness.
Naturally of a frail physique, she was left in an
impaired condition, which finally resulted in
lameness, compelling her to use a crutch. Ac-
tive and sensitive in her temperament, she was
led through this cause to desire to occupy her
mind and time with some clearly defined work
pertaining to the good of others. Fearing op-
position on account of her health, she secretly con-
sulted with her brother, Frank E. H. Gary, Esq.,
and at his request entered in 1882 the Boston
I'niversity School of Metlicine, from which she
was gratluated in 1885. In 1884 she received an
appointment as house surgeon in the Massa-
chusetts Homoeopathic Hospital, being the first
woman who had that honor; and she was acting
in this capacity at the time of her graduation.
In the meanwhile her health and strength im-
proved untler the skilful care and guidance of
Dr. Conrad Wesselhoeft and Dr. J. Heber
Smith.

In September, 1885, she openeil her first
office at 767 Tremont Street, Boston. Here
the early struggles of her practice commenced.
She kept in touch with college anil ilispeii-
sary work, holding the positions of pharmacist
to the dispensary and physician to one of the
children's clinics. Becoming very much inter-
ested in el(&gt;ctricity as applied to medicine, she
entered the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology for study of the science, in order to lay



110



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



a good foundation for work in that line, attend-
ing the lectures outside of her office hours.
Afterward she studied electricity as applied to
medicine under Dr. Rockwell in the Post-
graduate School of New York City. In 1888
she removed her office to 546 Columbus Avenue,
Boston, where she continued her work as a
general practitioner and electrotherapeutist
for twelve years. At the end of that periotl
the death of her mother, to whom she was
devotedly attached, so affected her health
that she felt compelled to temporarily relin-
quish her practice. 8he then went to Europe
for the double purpose of recuperating and
of studying more deeply the science of elec-
trotherapeutics. The latter object was ac-
complished under Dr. Planet, of Paris, France,
the skilled assistant of the late Dr. Apostle,
and in the large hospital at Vienna. When she
returned to Boston, .she removed her office to
"The Marlborough," 416 Marlborough Street,
where she is now practising.

Dr. Gary has occupied in the Boston Univer-
sity School of Metlicine the positions of demon-
strator in anatomy and lecturer in osteology
and electrotherapeutics. She is a member of
the National Society of Electrotherapeutists,
of which she has served as secretary in 1894,
second vice-president in 1895, first vice-presi-
dent in 1896, and presitlent in 1897. She is
a member of the American Institute of Home-
opathy, Massachusetts Homoeopathic Medical So-
ciety, Massachusetts Surgical and Gynecologi-
cal Society, Boston Homceopathic Medical Soci-
ety, and La Socicte Fran^aise d'Electrotherapie
et de Radiologic, Paris, France. In nearly
all of these societies she has held official posi-
tions.

Dr. Gary is also a member of many social or-
ganizations, and has written many articles and
papers bearing upon medical and scientific sub-
jects. It is hardly needful to say that one of
her greatest delights is in helping women less
fortunate than herself. In religious affiliations
she is a Baptist, having united at the very early
age of fourteen with the First Baptist Church
of Montpelier, Vt., a church which her father
and mother were largely instrumental in estab-
lishing. She is now a member of the First
Baptist Church, Clarendon Street, Boston.



E FLORENCE BARKER, the first Pres-
ident of the National Woman's Relief
, Corps (elected in July, 1883), was for
nearly a quarter of a century a resident
of Maiden, Mass., where. .she died September 11,
1897. She was the daughter of William A.
and Mary J. (Skinner) AVhittredge, was born in
LynnfieUl, Mass., March 29, 1840, and was edu-
cated in the public school of Lynnfield and at
the academy in Thetford, Vt.

On June 18, 1863, she, then E. Florence
Whittredge, became the wife of Colonel Thomas
Erskine Barker, of Gilmanton, N.H., he being
on a furlough, recovering from wounds received
in the battle of Chancellorsville. In July of
the same year Colonel Barker was able to re-
sume command of his regiment, the Twelfth
New Hampshire. His bride joined him in
August at Point Lookout, Md., and remained at
the front until the following April. Her tent
was tastefully decorated, and was a cheerful
rendezvous for the officers. This experience
gained of camp life during wartime increased
her regard for the ITnion soldiers, whom she
so often met in camp and hospitals, for Mrs.
Barker was intensely patriotic.

After the close of the war Colonel and Mrs.
Barker settled in Maiden, Mass. When the
Grand Army of the Republic was formed, Mrs.
Barker became deeply interested in its success.
She joined Major-general H. G. Berry Relief
Corps, auxiliary to Post No. 40, G. A. R., in
May, 1879, and served as its President four
years in,succe.ssion. At the convention of the
Department of Massachusetts W. R. C. in 1880
she was elected Department Senior Vice-Presi-
dent, and in 1881 was re-elected. She was
chosen Department President the following
year, and filled the office so acceptably that
she was re-elected in 1883.

Eighteen cor})s were instituted during her
administration. While presiding over the State
convention in Boston, January, 1883, she had
the pleasure of welcoming Paul Van Der Voort,
of Omaha, Neb., Commander-in-chief of the
Grand Army of the Republic, and other promi-
nent comrades. That the eloquent manner in
which Mrs. Barker reviewed the work and princi-
ples of the )\'onian's Relief Corps impressed the
commander-in-chief with the value of such an



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



111



auxiliary is witnessed by the following, which
he officially promulgated in a general order
dated February 16, 1883:—

"The commander-in-chief is delighted to
learn that the loyal women of the land are form-
ing auxiliary societies everywhere. The grand
work done by these organizations is worthy of
the highest praise.

"The Woman's Relief Corps of Massachusetts
is hereby particularly mentioned on account of
its perfect organization and the work it has
accomplished. The President of the same,
Mrs. E. Florence Barker, of Maiden, Mass., will
be happy to furnish information.
" By commantl of
"Paul Van Der Voort,

" Commander-in-chiej .
"F. E. Brown, Adjutant-general."

In general orders issued May 1, 1883, an-
nouncing the arrangements for the Seventeenth
National Encampment, to be held in Denver,
Col., July 24-28, Commander-in-chief Van Der
Voort cordially invited representatives of the
Woman's Relief Corps and othej- societies work-
ing for the Grand Army of the Rejjublic to meet
at Denver and perfect a national organization,
adding: "They should bring their rituals, rules,
by-laws, and plans of organization, and if pos-
sible agree on a uniform mode or system of
procedure throughout the country. I pledge
the noble women who compose these societies
that they will be warmly greeted and given all
the encouragement possil)le. Miss Clara Barton
has promised to be present."

At a meeting of the board of directors of the
Department of Mas.sachusetts, W. R. C, held
in Boston, June 27, 1SS3, Mrs. E. Florence
Barker, Mrs. Sarah E. Fuller, and Mrs. Liza-
beth A. Turner were chosen delegates to repre-
sent this department at the convention in
Denver. It was voted that the Department of
New Hampshire be invited to unite with Massa-
chusetts in sending delegates.

Mrs. Barker presided with grace and tact
over the deliberations of the women's con-
vention at Denver, which was attended by
delegates from several States. At the sec-
ond day's session it was voted to form a Na-



tional Woman's Relief Corps on the same
basis as that of the Department of Massachu-
setts, provided the National Encampment of
the Grand Army of the Republic shoukl decide
to recognize this action. Several of the
delegates present refused to endorse the
clause in the rules and regulations admitting
to membership other women than relations of
soldiers.

This clause also caused a lengthy discussion
in the National Encampment when the resolu-
tion of endorsement was debated, for several
conu'ades who believed in a woman's national
organization opposed any movement in its be-
half that would not restrict the membership
to relations of soldiers.

Past Conunantler-in-chief George S. Merrill,
of Massachusetts, said : " We certainly, com-
rades of the Grand .\rmy of the Republic,
cannot afford to do anything that can by any
possible means be construetl as discourteous
or hostile to any of the loyal women of America."

Comrade William Warner, of Missouri (since
Commander-in-chief), participated in the de-
bate, saying in part : " I come from a State that
has no organization, and that has no interest
in any differences between the various organi-
zations. I come from a State in which there
does not breathe a loyal man who does not ex-
tend the right hantl of welcome to every sister,
mother, or sweetheart within her borders,
whose heart beats in sympathy with us."

The resolution which was offered by Chap-
lain-in-chief Foster was atlopted, namely: "That
we cordially h:iil the organization of a National
Woman's Relief Corps, and extend our greeting
to them. We return our warmest thanks to
the loyal women of the land for their earnest
support and encouragement, and bid them
Gotl-speed in their patriotic work."

A messenger was sent to the W. R. C. Con-
vention with an invitation for its members to
attend the installation of officers of the G. A. R.,
and the meeting was adjouinetl at noon until
three o'clock p.m. Proceeding to the Tabor
Opera House, the delegates were officially noti-
fied of the vote of endorsement. Robert B.
Beath, of Philadelphia, the historian of the
G. A. R., was installed as Commander-in-chief,
and, upon assuming the office and addressing



112



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



the encampment, he said: "I have not been
able to enter into the details of the organiza-
tion of a Ladies' Aid Society by the good ladies
who have assembled in this city of Denver for
this purpose; but, whatever they shall do that
tends to perpetuate the great humane work
of the \yar, that has now devolved on the Grand
Army of the Republic, and upon all their wives
and sisters and friends, I can assure them of
my most hearty support."

The auxiliary also received a cordial welcome
from other speakers, among them General John
A. Logan, who said: "I was once a sufferer on
a battle-held and long afterward in a hospital,
and every morn I coukl feel as if a silver cord
was twined aroimd a capstan in the region of
glory and reached to my heart, where it was
anchored by the hand of woman. I thank
God that he has brought to the front this aux-
iliary; that there was mind enough, charity
enough, generosity enough, to bring into ex-
istence the Woman's Relief Corps."

The convention, upon reassemljling, voted to
hold its annual sessions on the date and in the
city chosen by the National Encampment,
G. A. R., and then elected officers for the en-
suing year, namely: President, E. Florence
Barker, Maiden, Mass. ; Senior Vice-President,
Kate B. Sherwood, Toledo, Ohio; Junior Vice-
President, E. K. Stimson, Denver, Col. ; Sec-
retary, Sarah E. Fuller, East Boston, Mass.;
Treasurer, Lizabeth A. Turner, Boston, Mass. ;
Chaplain, Mattie B. Moulton, Laconia, N.H.;
Inspector, Emily Gardner, Denver, Col.; Con-
ductor, P. S. Runyan, \\'arsaw, Ind.; Guard,
J. W. Beatson, Rockford, 111.; Corresponding
Secretaries, Mary J. Telford, Denver, Col., and
Ellen Fay, Topeka, Kan.

Mrs. Barker accepted an invitation to in-
stall the officers-elect, and after performing
this ceremony she was duly installetl as National
President by Mrs. Fuller. At the close of the
convention its members were guests at a re-
ception tendered in the evening to Commander-
in-chief Beath antl Past Commander-in-chief
Van Der Voort.

An invitation was extended the women from
Massachusetts to accompany the commander-
in-chief's l)arty on a trip through the Colorado
caiions. This afforded an excellent opportu-



nity for conference upon the work of the
year, and the mutual interests of the two
national organizations were considered by their
leaders.

Through the courtesy of George S. Evans,
Department Conmiander, national headquar-
ters W. R. C. were established at the head-
quarters of the Department of Massachusetts,
G. A. R., in Pemberton Square, Boston.

To prove that a national order was needed,
that the plan adopted at Denver was the best,
and that women were capable of managing
a large organization with ritualistic forms ami
parliamentary rules, required excellent judg-
ment, tact, and a love for the work. These
qualities were combined in Mrs. Barker, who
sought advice from the officials of the Grand
Army of the Republic, and recognized the
importance of harmonious co-operation with
them.

In her first general order, dated September 1,
1883, she said: "While working in unison with
the G. A. R., we can accomplish great results
and build well the structure, which we hope
will stand years after the watchful comrades
have left — as they must — their unfinished work
to our willing hands."

At the National Convention at Minneapolis
in July, 1884, Mrs. Barker was able to say:
"Our success far exceeds the high anticipations
of our most sanguine friends." She wrote
over a thousand letters during the year she
served as National President, visited the De-
partments of Maine, New Hampshire, and Con-
necticut, and performed numerous other duties.
She declined a re-election, but was made a life
member of the National Executive Board, and
until her ileath was a leader in the affairs of
the order. A woman of commanding presence,
always presiding with grace and dignity, Mrs.
Barker was also an elocjuent speaker, and she
addressed many patriotic gatherings in different
parts of the coimtry. She represented the
order at the International Council of Women
held in Washington, D.C., in 1889, and favored
progressive action when advocating the claims
of woman's work for the veterans.

The National Woman's Relief Corps has re-
ceived the cordial endorsement of every Na-
tional Encampment since 1883, and is the only

recognized auxiliary to the GraiKl Army of the
Republic. It is conducting a great work in
every State and Territory of the Union, and
numbers over one hundred forty thousand
members. It has expended more than two
million dollars in relief and many thousands
of dollars additional in behalf of patriotic edu-
cation in the public schools, in the erection of
monuments and memorial halls, in the sacred
observance of Memorial Day, in securing pen-
sions for army nurses, and in other legislative
work of importance.

A National AVoman's Relief Corps Home
has been founded at Matlison, Ohio, for the
wives and mothers of soldiers and for dependent
army nurses ; and homes have also been founded
and are being supported by the order in several
States.

Mrs. Barker was deeply interested in the
Soldiers' Home in Chelsea, Mass., and was one
of the founders of the Ladies' Aid Ai?.sociation
which co-operates with the Board of Trustees,
of which Colonel Barker was treasurej. A
room at the home, furnished by the Depart-
ment of Massachusetts W. R. C, contains her
portrait, and is designated by a banner with
the inscription, "Dedicated in honor of Mrs.
E. Florence Barker, first National President
of the Woman's Relief Corps."

When Mrs. Barker, in 1884, retired from the
office of President, her associates in the Depart-
ment of Massachusetts presented to her an en-
grossed testimonial as a mark of appreciation
and esteem, saying in part: "The excellent
judgment ever manifested during the two years
in which you .servetl this department as Presi-
dent, the fidelity with which you rendered
service as first National President of the order,
your influence, everywhere recognized, hare
conferred honor upon our work, and aided in
giving it a permanent endorsement by the
Grand Army of the Republic throughout the
land."

Mrs. Barker did not confine her interests
entirely to Grand Army and Soldiers' Home
work. She was one of the directors of the
Union ex-Prisoners of War National Memorial
Association, treasurer (and president one year)
of the Woman's Club House Corporation of
Boston, a trustee of the Maiden Hospital, and



a director of the Hospital Aid Association.
She exerted an influence in public work and
social life, and thoroughly enjoyed her asso-
ciations in both.

In all her public work Mrs. Barker received
the hearty co-operation of her husband, Thomas
Erskine Barker. He was born in Canterbury,
N.H., in 1839, and was educated in the public
schools. He enlistetl in Company B, Goodwin
Rifles, Second Regiment, New Hampshire Vol-
unteers, May 31, 1861, and on the next day
was made Captain. He was taken by the enemy
at the first battle of Bull Run, and was con-
fined in Libby Prison at Richmond, Va., and
in Salisbury, N.C. After nine months in rebel
prisons he was paroled and sent N(jrth. At
his own request he was tlischarged from the
army in July, 1862. He re-enlisted as a pri-
vate, joining Company B, Belknap Guards,
Twelfth Regiment, New Hampshire Volunteers,
and was elected and conmiissioned Captain.
He engaged in the battles of Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville, V'a., and was wounded
in the latter conflict.

Soon after the battle of Gettysburg he re-
turned to duty and was placed in command of
the regiment. Colonel Barker was in the battle
of Cold Harbor, in the series of engagements
in front of Petersburg, where for twenty-two
successive days he was under fire, and he was
also present at the capture and occupation of
Richmond. He was commissioned Lieutenant
Colonel in October, 1864, ami Colonel in April,
1865. At the conclusion of hostilities he was
placed in command of the United States forces
at Danville, \ii., and, after a few weeks' ser-
vice there as military governor, was ordered
with the regiment to Concord, N.H., where it
was mustered out of service.

For some years he was in the employ of a
wholesale giocery firm in Boston. In 1872 he
was admitted into partnership with Wadleigh,
Spurr &amp; Co. 1880-88 he was a member of
the firm of Andrews, Barker &amp; Bunton, and on
June 1, 1889, he became one of the fiim of
Barker &amp; Harris, brokers and commission mer-
chants.

Colonel Barker was a resident of Maiden
twenty-two years, and was prominent in many
social organizations. He was a member of



114

Mount Vernon Lodge of Masons; the Royal
Arch Chapter; the Middlesex Club; the Loyal
Legion of Massachusetts; the Kernwood Club,
of Maiden; and of Major-general H. G. Berry
Post, No. 40, G. A. R., of that city. He served
as Assistant Quartermaster-general of the De-
partment of Massachusetts, G. A. R., and often
attended as a delegate the National Encamp-
ments. For many years he was a member of
the Boston Chamber of Commerce, and for three
terms was president of the Boston Wholesale
Grocers' Association.

For two years he represented Maiden in the
lower branch of the State Legislature. His
last political service was as a delegate in the
Republican Congressional Convention at Lynn
in October, LS96.

Colonel Barker was a leatling member of the
Universalist Church in Maiden, and was for
many years superintendent of its Sunday-
school. To the interests of the Soldiers' Home
he was sincerely devoted, and was treasurer of
its Board of Trustees at the time of his death,
December 17, 1896.

The Woman's Relief Corps lost one of its
earliest and most earnest friends by the death
of Colonel Barker. It was he who framed the
first resolution ever presented in a department
encampment of the Grand Army of the Repub-
lic, endorsing a State Relief Corps.

The death of Mrs. Barker occurred less than
a year after her husband's passing. Memorial
services were held by corps throughout the
country, posts of the Grand Army joining in
these tributes to her memory. Her portrait
has been placed in department headquarters in
Boston.

The home in Maiden of Colonel and Mrs.
Barker welcomed prominent guests from many
vStates. One room was devoted to relics, among
them a jewelled swortl, presented to the Colonel
by the officers of his regiment; his commission
as military governor of Danville, Va.; a bolt
fiom Libby Prison, in which he was confined
several months; and hanging on the walls of
the room was the engrossed testimonial, above
named, which she cherished as a valuable sou-
venir.

Colonel and Mrs. Barker are survived by two
daughters and one son — namely, Florence,



Blanche, and William E. The last named is in
business in Boston, and resides at Maiden.

The daughters are married, and their home is
in Kentucky.



LAVINA ALLEN HATCH. — On June 19,
1819, occurred the marriage of Isaac
__J Hatch, Jr., and Lavina Allen. During
the ceremony a heavy thunder-storm
prevailed, but later the moon came out. In its
pleasant light the young couple rode the four
miles from the home of the bride to a large
house on a pleasant site in the east part of
the town of Pembroke, where they were to
begin their life work together. Opposite the
house was the pond that furnished power for
the woollen-mill where the young man, five
years before, at the age of seventeen, had com-
menced his business career as a manufacturer
of kerseymere.

Mr. Hatch, known as Isaac, Jr., was the fourth
of his name in direct line, and was of the seventh
generation of his family in New England.
William' Hatch, his earliest known ancestor,
a native of Sandwich, England, came to this
country in ,1633 or a little earlier, and in March,
1635, settled in Scituate, with his wife Jane
and five children. His son Walter^ was the
father of Samuel,' born in 1653, whose son
Isaac* was born in Scituate in 1687. Lsaac^
settled in Pembroke, Mass. His son Isaac,''
born in 1717, was the father of Lsaac,'^ born in
1764. Isaac' (Isaac, Jr.), son of Isaac," was
born in 1796.

His wife Lavina came from the Allen family
of Dover, Mass., but was born in Bowdoinham,
Me., her father, Hezekiah Allen, having moved
there and engaged in ship-building. Lavina
Allen was sent to Roxbury, Mass., at the age
of twelve, to continue her studies, and after
leaving school she made her home in the family
of an uncle, the Rev. Morrill Allen, settled over
the First Parish (now Unitarian) of Pembroke.
A few years of school-'teaching with the low
wages of that period followed, and then, at
the age of twenty-two, she became, as narrated
above, the wife of a woollen manufacturer.
Industry and economy were the rule of the
household. The record shows the births of



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



115



seven children, four of whom grew to adult
age. The two now living are Isaac, fifth, and
Martin.

Lavina A., the subject of this sketch, born
May 20, 1836, and named for her mother, was
the youngest child. It was a very small bit
of humanity, weighing less than six pounds,
whose eyes then opened to earth life. The
baby seemed healthy, but endowed with a frail-
ness of organization that caused frequent ill
turns. The family doctor was an uncle, much
loved by the little niece, who always remem-
bered his look of surpri.'^e, when, with his finger
on the little wrist, he said, "Child, will you
never have any pulse?" At the age of thirteen
she was sent to Wheaton Female Seminary, to
be fitted for teaching. Her eyes soon gave out,
and, in place of pursuing the course of study
anticipated, she began to teach a school two
miles from home in order " to have an object
that would make long walks each day a neces-
sity."

In this way years passed, the winters spent
at Partridge Academy in Duxbury and Hano-
ver Academy, and other months spent in
teaching. Pembroke, Scituate, Hanover, East
Bridgewater, and Abington were the towns
where she is still remembered as a teacher who
not only disapproved of corporal punishment,
but succeeded in controlling even the most un-
ruly members of what were known as " hard
schools," doing this by the use of moral suasion
joined to a personal magnetism that made
friends of those who came to make mischief,
but remained to become helpful scholars. It
was the habit of this teacher to join in the
games and sports of the pupils. Many will
never forget one summer da}', when, the rain
having poured for hours, and the sun just
struggled out, the door of the school-room was
softly opened, and the three committee-men
stood amazed to find the teacher with eyes
blinded and a brisk game of blind man's buff
in active progress. A sudden hush, and " ( )
teacher, the conmiittee are here," Ijrought the
game to a close and the blinder from her eyes.
She simply said, "Now rece.ss is over, let the
committee see that we can work as well as
play." In later years this same physician,
the late Asa Millett, M.D., recalled an incident



that showed her to be resourceful under diffi-
culties, as when being "examined" to take a
school. She had gone through the ordeal on
one occasion with doubtful success, and felt in
despair of the result, when physiology was
introduced, and Dr. Millett said: "I think we
need not ask many more questions. Miss
Hatch, suppose one of your boys at play should
sever the jugular vein, what would you do first?"
"Send for the doctor" came like a flash from
her lips, as her eyes met his; and both indulged
in a laugh that was a contrast to the look of
dignified displeasure of the two ministers who
had hardly approved the sudden close of the
examination. "So true it is," she used to say,
"when wisdom leaves me, wit saves."

At the close of three years of what she called
her model school, in Abington, she gave up
teaching to take charge of a brother's home
and care for a motherless niece and nephew.
Later she adopted the children, and was a
mother to them. In the early sixties we find
her in the old country home, teaching a private
school, helping an invalid mother, doing a
share of the cooking and the other housework,
caring for the little ones, and performing the
duties of the postmistress of East Pembroke,
all in the same day. In these years she wrote
much for the Student and Srhoolmate, a monthly
magazine, which ended its existence when the
Boston fire in 1872 swept out the building
where it was published. Stories, poems, dia-
logues, puzzles, prepared by her in odd minutes,
appeared over the name of "Eben."

When the Massachusetts Society for Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals was formed. Miss
Hatch was the first agent who answered its
call for help. Taking Plymouth County as
her field of labor, she spent much time in ob-
taining subscribers to the paper. Our Dumb
Aninialif, and members for the society, her
mother becoming the first life member on her
list. A few years later Mrs. Hatch made her
daughter a life member also. Joining a lodge
of the Sons of Temperance, Miss Hatch was an
active member, in the frequent absences of the
regular chaplain taking his place, conducting
the initiatory exercises as well as the usual
opening services. While the Civil War was
in progress, a local society was formed to co-



116

operate with the United States Sanitary Com-
mission, and, persuaiUng a neighbor to accept
the office of president. Miss Hatch assumed
that of secretary. All the women around be-
coming interested, they provided a compara-
tively large amount of soldiers' clothing.
When no more money could be raised there,
she went to Boston and conferred with Abby
W. May, president of the State Association,
and after that until the close of the Rebellion
material for sewing and knitting was sent from
Boston to the willing workers of East Pem-
broke. At the close of the school, each after-
noon, a horse and wagon stood ready, and this
patriotic teacher drove around the neighbor-
hood for fruit with which to make pickles.
This work she always did herself, and the barrels
of pickles often brought a letter of response
from the "boys" who had been so fortunate
as to get them. One special barrel of pickled
peaches will always be remembered by maker
and consumers.

After a severe attack of spinal meningitis
in the winter of 1875-76, the summer finds her
at the Centennial Fair in Philadelphia. She
lived four and a half months on the grounds
of Fairmont Park in the New England Log
Cabin, where was shown a collection of antiques,
and daily was served an old-fashioned New
England dinner. Each of the workers had
an old-fashioned name, and wore an ancient
style of dress. The name of Dorcas, assumed
by Miss Hatch, clung to her ever after. At
this time she was also known to a few as the
writer of centennial notes over the signature
of "John Lake."

For the next two years she lived in Charles-
town, in order to be near Boston and under
the treatment of Dr. J. T. G. Pike.

In 1878 the invalid mother passed on and
left the daughter more free to take up various
kinds of work. The niece had become a suc-
cessful music teacher, the nephew a promising
young machinist; so the aunt established a home
for all at 50 Boylston Street, Boston, spending
the summers at the old home in the country.

She soon became an active worker on suffrage
lines, being the secretary of Ward Twelve Club
and of the National Woman Suffrage Associa-
tion of Massachusetts. The latter office she



held seventeen years, and did not once omit
a monthly meeting, except when sick or absent
from the State, attending one of the Associa-
tion's annual conventions in Washington.
Here, too, she was a working member, always
on one or more committees that left little time
for recreation. In the fourteen seasons in
which, she was present, not one hour was spent
outside while the convention was in session.
Of the Boston Political Class, also, which was
formed by the Association in 1884, and which
continued in existence for several years. Miss
Hatch served as secretary.

Soon after the formation of the Boston Suf-
frage League she took active part as recording
secretary, and later succeedetl to the office of
corresponding secretary. The work attend-
ing the initiatory steps in forming leagues in
and arountl Boston was largely done by the
secretary. It was she who went to the outlying
districts, called on the people, worked up the
interest, hired halls, engaged speakers, sent
out notices of meetings, and was present to
help make each one a success.

In 1886 Miss Hatch removed to 60 Bowdoin
Street. Ward Ten now had one more voter,
with the same enthusiasm for public school
work that had helped develop the cause in
Ward Twelve; and the ward committee, with
Dr. Salome Merritt as leader, maile a persist-
ent study of the situation, giving valuable
aid to the Massachusetts School Suffnige Asso-
ciation in the search for the best women and
men to elect for the school board. It was at
this time that the New England Helping Hand
Society began its work, the object being to
give a home to small girls whose wages were
insufficient to provide even the necessaries of
life. For several years, as secretary of the
Board of Management of the Working Girls'
Home, as well as a member of committees,
Miss Hatch did her full share in directing its
affairs, though often disapproving the action
of the majority; but finally, with several other
officers and members, she withdrew from the
organization.

Having been one of the workers at the fair in
aid of the Intemiierate Woman's Home, she
joined with others in the formation of the
Woman's Charity Club Hospital. Just as the



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



117



institution was to be opened with appropriate
ceremonies, Miss Hatch was very ill with
la grippe. A year later she fell and broke her
right wrist, but she retained her office as sec-
retary of the Hosi)ital I^oard, and accomplished
the usual committee work.

The year 1888 proved unfortunate. Hav-
ing passed three years at 60 Bowdoin Street,
she spent time and money in the expectation
of staying there years more. But, the place
suddenly changing owners, she moved out,
and stored her furniture.

As chairman of the nominating committee
of women voters. Miss Hatch labored to secure
a suitable list of men and women to report for
the fall campaign. The A. P. A. element
came to the front, and in some cases men as
well as women joined it, but many soon left on
learning its narrow and deceptive platform.
Miss Hatch went to Washington in December,
remaining there for several months. She there
conceived the idea that the thing needed in
Boston was concerted action by the women
and men of a liberal turn of mind, to educate
the people against the wave of narrowne.ss
sweeping the State in the shape of lectures
and literature. In letters to the old workers
she explained this plan. The Rev. Samuel J.
Barrows being in Washington the same .season,
she conferred with him, and was greatly en-
couraged by his approval and promise of aid.
Mi.ss Hatch reached Boston in July in time to
attend the meeting called to discuss this new
plan. It proved a disappointment, as some
of tho.se present advised that it be an organiza-
tion of women. But wi.ser ways prevailed,
and .soon the Citizens' Public School Union,
composed of men antl women, was in working
order, with Dr. Salome Merritt as president
and Mrs-. Frances E. Billings (wife of the artist
Billings) as the secretary. Meetings were hekl,
literature printed and circulated, and in time
much of the mischief was stamped out. After
Mrs. Billings removed from the city, her place
was filletl by Miss Hatch as long as she remainetl
in Boston. In 1889, as delegate from the
Woman's Charity Club, Miss Hatch became
a member of the Committee of Council and
Co-operation; and in the years following she
held much of the time the office of clerk. When



Dr. Merritt pa.s.sed on, in November, 1900,
Miss Hatch was unanimously elected chairman.

Having been brought up in the liberal at-
mosphere of Unitarianism, Miss Hatch early
became a member of the church and a teacher
in the Sunday-school. To her early religious
belief she added that of Spiritualism, of which
she became a consistent and persistent student.
Unwilling to encourage by her presence any
sensational display, she was never found where
any tloubt could exist of the genuinene.ss of
the phenomena exhibited. Though neither
clairvoyant nor clairaudient, she seemed always
aware of the presence of spirit guides and
friends, and talked with them in familiar style
as if they were in the body. She has been
heard to say, " My life woukl not have been worth
living the last twenty-five years but for the con-
stant help and conijianionship of my spirit
friends."

Removing from Boston in 1897, Miss Hatch
spent the closing years of her life at East Pem-
broke, with summers at Onset. Invited by-
Susan B. Anthony to ])repare the chapter giving
the work of the Ma.ssachusetts National Asso-
ciation for the fourth volume of the History
of Woman Suffrage from 1884 to 1900, that
writing was crowded into her busy life. Many
hours each week she passed out of doors, often
for whole days riding with an invalid brother,
camping out in suitable weather and as late
as was comff)rtable. Work in the home garden
was not neglected, how&lt;^ver numerous might
be other cares, and at all hours of the day
she was out of doors, taking a rest from her pen
in pulling off dry leaves or picking bouquets
for the numerous chiklren who frecjuented
the place. She reporteil herself but a few
months ago as feeling each year younger than
the last.

Though nearing the old age of which many
speak as a dreary season, she had no such
thoughts, but contemplated many busy years,
possibly the happiest of her life, before the
coming of the change which is " but crossing,
with bated breath and with .set face, a little
strip of .sea, to find the loved ones waiting on
the shore, more beautiful, more precious, than
before."

This change came March 20, 1903.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



JUDITH AV. ANDREWS, philanthropist,
was born in Fryeburg, Me., April 26,
1826. Her maiclen name was Walker.
.Her father, Peter Walker, born at Con-
cord, N.H., in 1781, died in that city in 1857.
Her mother, Abigail Swan Walker, born at
Bethel, Me., in 1787, died in Boston in 1861.
At Fryeliurg .\cadeniy, where she was educated,
Judith A\'alker carried her studies so far as to
qualify her to enter the Junior Class of Dart-
mouth College. After her graduation from the
academy she taught for several years, both in
the academy and in young ladies' schools at
York and Kittery. Subsecjuently her brother,
Dr. Clement Adams Walker, one of the new
school of jihysicians for the insane, having been
appointed to take charge of the Boston lAmatic
Hospital, established in 1839 as the Boston
Insane Hospital, she joined him at that insti-
tution, and, although never officially connected
therewith, she interested herself in the details
of its administration, and by her personal at-
tention to the patients endeared herself to
them. No better school of training could have
been found for the activities to which she has
given nuich of her life. P^or more than thirtj'
j'ears Dr. Walker, who was the third superin-
tendent, succeeding Dr. Charles Stedman
and his predecessor, Dr. John S. Butlei-, sus-
tained and increased the reputation of the
hospital for intelligent and humane treatment
of the insane. He was much beloved by his
patients.

On January 15, 1857, Miss Walker was mar-
ried to General Joseph Andrews, of Salem, a
man of generous public spirit, who gave much
time and labor to the improvement of the
militia system of the Commonwealth both be-
fore and during the Civil War. In 1863 he
removed with his family to Boston, where he
died in 1869, leaving Mrs. Andrews with three
little boys to care for and educate. The eldest
son, Clement Walker Andrews, A.M., is now
librarian of the John Crerar Library (scientific),
of Chicago, III.; the second, Horace Davis An-
drews, is an expert in mining matters in the
West; the youngest, Joseph Andrews, holds a
position of trust in the Bank of New York, in
New York City.

When the family removed to Boston, Mrs.



Andrews' became a memlwM- of the South Con-
gregational Church (Unitarian). Elected presi-
dent of its ladies' organization, the "South
Friendly Society," in 1876, she held that posi-
tion until January, 1903, when she declined a
re-election. Her service of twenty-seven years
is the longest in the history of a society in
which only five terms have covered its whole
existence of seventy years. In 1883 she heljied
to organize the South End Industrial School,
an institution founded to give elementary
manual training to the children of Roxbury
and the South End of Boston. It was sup-
ported by Unitarian churches and individvials,
the South Congregational Church and many
of its members being prominent helpers. Mrs.
Andrews was elected its first jiresident, and re-
mained in office until 1899, when she retired,
after sixteen years of faitliful service.

For some years she was a member of the
New England Women's Cluli. She is still a
mendier of the Woman's Educational Associa-
tion, and remains an interested but not an
active member of the Women's Educational
and Industrial Union. She was one of the or-
ganizers of the District Nursing Association
and of the Young Travellers' Aid Society, of
both of which for a time she was an active
mendier and officer. She is also a member of
the Women's Anti-suffrage Society, of the
Massachusetts Ci^'il Service Reform Associa-
tion, and of other smaller organizations.

The South ('ongregational Church, under the
influence of its pastor. Dr. Edward Everett
Hale, has had witle relations, both inside and
outside denominational lines; and these rela-
tions have brought to Mrs. Andrews opportu-
nities for religious and philanthroj^ic work, to
which she has always been ready to respond.
While most of these, though requiring much
time, work, and thought, are of a local charac-
ter, two lines of her work have made her name
familiar to a large circle throughout the coun-
try. Elected in 1886 president of the AVomen's
Auxiliary Conference, she was active in the
movement to enlarge its scope and usefulness;
and in 1889, when the National Alliance of
Unitarian and Other Lilieral Christian Women
was organized, she became its tirst jiresident,
declining a re-election in 1891. For several




fllAHLO'lTK .1. THOMAS



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENCxLAND



119



years she was a member of the Council of
the National Unitarian Conference. She is
a life member of the American Unitarian Asso-
ciation.

In 1887, through the eloquent appeals, and
later the personal frientlship, of Pundita Ra-
mabai Mrs. Andrews became deeply interested
in the condition of the high-caste child widows
of India. In 1888 she was largely instrumental
in the formation of the Ramabai Association,
pledged for ten years to support Ramabai in
her work for the redemption of her sisters and
the uplifting of her jjeople. To the Executive
Committee, of which Mrs. Andrews was made
chairman, was entrusted the official corre-
spondence concerning the management of the
Shiirada Sadan (Home of Wisdom) at Poona,
also the settlement of many delicate questions
arising from a work so opposed to the customs
of India. In 1894, as an officer of the as.so-
ciation, Mrs. Andrews visited India, and passed
nearly eight months at the Sharada Sadan, in
daily intercourse with Ramabai and her pupils,
becoming acquaintetl with the details of the
home and school, learning the sad histories of
the child widows, antl studying their charac-
teristics and capabilities. She visited some of
the most important cities of India with Ra-
mabai as "guide, philo,so|)her, and friend," thus
gaining an insight into the social customs and
evils of the country such as she could have
obtained in no other way. All of this experi-
ence enabled her to return to America with ac-
curate knowledge and increased power to plead
Ramabai's cause and to emphasize the purpose,
the needs, and the wontlerful success of the
work. In 1898 the term of the original Ra-.
mabai Association expired; and the American
Ramabai ^Association was then formed, to con-
tinue the work on nearly the same lines, which
lines were strictly undenominational. At this
organization Ramabai was present. Mrs. An-
drews was again made chairman of the Execu-
tive Committee, and still holds the position.

During the fifteen years' existence of the
Ramabai Association it has had but three presi-
dents, the Rev. Dr. Edward E. Hale, the Rev.
Dr. Lyman Abbott, the Rev. Dr. E. Winchester
Donald. Among its officers have been some
of the most prominent professional and business



men and philanthropic and generous women
of Boston. The reputation of this work and
the interest in it are world-wide.



CHARLOTTE J. THOMAS may here
be introduced as one who showed at
an early age that she dared stand
alone. From the time she became
mistress of speech she has talked with decision
and originality, neither quoting nor leaning
upon the opinions of others. She has framed
thought and utterance for herself with ex-
traordinary spirit and vigor.

Miss Thomas's mother was a woman pos-
sessing much force of character and a disposi-
tion of great sweetness. She impressed upon
her children's minds, while th^y were very
young, that this "earth's unfortunates had a
human claim upon them." She was connected
with " the underground railway of the old
slavery days," and many a fugitive from the
South has had reason to bless her name. The
daughter early became her mother's assistant
and confidante, antl all her life has aided the
sick and suffering, the ambitious and the poor.
Though her name has been associated with
various organizations, the greater amount of
her charitable work has been individual and
unmentioned. The home of Miss Thomas is
a noted one in Portland. "The Social Corner,"
as one of the family friends named it with so
much truth, has become a familiar woril, and
stands for hospitality, music, originality, and
good cheer. Guests of all classes are made
welcome in this home with the fine courtesy
which brings instant comfort. Entertainment
is never offered in stereotyped form, but free-
dom of speech, quaint stories, and suddenly
suggested plans give all the happy hours a tinge
of surprise and novelty. It has been said of
the historic Thomas mansion: "Notable people
go there, but many others are invited. Not
rank, but true manhood, true womanhood, the
trying to do good in the spirit of brotherhootl,
is the passport to that house." In Old Home
W^eek during the summer of 1900 Miss Thomas
had her house decorated with flags and pict-
ures, and inscribed with the word "Welcome"
and the year in which it was built, 1800. Late

in the afternoon an elderly man presented him-
self at the door, saying he had seen the legend
"Welcome," and, as he was a builder himself,
he would like to examine a house constructed
at the date indicated, whereupon Miss Thomas
assured him that the word was no hollow mock-
ery, and cordially invited him to join her fam-
ily at the supper table.

The Beecher Club, the first evolution club
in Maine, was founded at the "Social Corner."
Miss A. M. Beecher, cousin of the noted preacher,
Henry Ward Beecher, on one of her visits to
Miss Thomas gave a course of familiar talks
on science and philanthroj^y. At the close
of the visit, through Miss Thomas's influence
the club was ff)rme(l, and named in honor of
Miss Beecher. The spirit of the home — strength
and incUviduality — has remained with the club,
and proved a power for good. The originator
tells an anuising story concerning her efforts
in making up the membership. Approaching
a lady on the subject and explaining the char-
acter of the study to be undertaken, the lis-
tener lifted her hands in dismay and said re-
proachfully, "Why, Miss Thomas, I thought
you believed in God!"

Genial and whole-hearted, Miss Thomas has
a fine disregard for conventionalities, and de-
spises affectation and sham. With a strong
sense of justice, she unflinchingly urges the
rights of her .sex, and by her influence has helped
bring aliout a number of good 'reforms both in
customs anil State laws.

Among her personal friends may be named
Mary A. Livermore, Susan B. Anthony (often
her guest). Miss A. M. Beecher, Sarah J. Farmer,
of Greenacre, and such departed worthies as
Charlotte Cushman, Lucy Stone, Parker Pills-
bury, John Hutchinson, antl Dr. Elliott Coues.

Mrs. Elliott Coues has spoken thus of Mi.ss
Thomas: "If I had nothing ei.se to be thankful
for in this life, having had her for my friend
would be reason enough for my giving thanks.
All who know her will say 'Yes' with a rising
vote and a Chautauciua cheer for one of the
grandest women ever born on this planet. Did
any one ever go there with a tale of woe that
she did not try to assist anil strengthen with
good, kind words and deeds of corresponding
worth?"



Another close friend adds: "If I were asked
where under ' Representative Women ' Char-
lotte J. Thomas stood, I shouUl class her with
tho.se whose watchword is emancipation — free-
dom of thouglit, speech, and action, wherever
such freedom woukl lead to the betterment of
mankind. To have original and persistent
ideas and to develop them honestly and inde-
pendently has been her unswerving aim. These
characteristics have shown themselves first and
always in the home, where nmsic, society, and
hospitality have been of an unusual scoj^e and
of choice quality. To high antl low her atti-
tude has been and is, 'You have innate noble-
ness: give the best in you a chance to show it-
self and to increase and benefit your fellow-
beings.' Such a trend on the individual side
has naturally on public (piestions meant 'anti-
slavery, woman suffrage, education without
stint, and \miversal brotherhood.' Here is a
democratic instinct that does not content itself
with word of mouth, but daily puts into prac-
tice the precepts it holds flear. The group of
personal friends mentioned above are but a few
of her companions in the good fight. There's
liberty for every happy and uplifting influ-
ence to work its wholesome and beneficent
way in the minds of men, women, and children
in this home which we hold in fee simple
as a prejmration for further development and
])rogress."



GEORGIA TYLER KENT was born
in La Grange, Ga., eldest daughter
of Nelson Franklin Tyler, of Massa-
chusetts, and Henrietta Snowden, his
wife, of Maryland. She married July 2, LS78,
Daniel Kent, a graduate of Amherst College,
law student of Boston University, and later
admitted to the Indiana bar, son of Daniel
Waldo and Harriet Newell (Grosvenor) Kent,
of Leicester, Mass.

Mrs. Kent in her school-ilays was thought by
her teachers and others to have unusual talent
as a writer. Her education was especially
directed toward developing any latent ability
of this kinil, with the hope that she would
make literature her life work. This, at the
time, did not appeal to her, and in the autumn



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



121



of 1875 she entered upon her chosen career
as a member of the Boston Museum Company.
It was with a heavy heart, on account of the
bitter opposition of her family. Her rapid
rise from unimportant to leading nMes proved
she had not mistaken her vocation. During
her second season she made a vivid impression
in the short part of Servia, to the Virginius
of John McCullough and the \'irginia of Mary
Gary. The critics united in her praise, saying
she "showed powers which will with care de-
velop into something suited for the best roles
in tragedy." Mr. McCullough was so impressed
with her work he personally requested she
might be cast for the leading Indian role of
Nameokee to his Metamora. Her success in
this led Mr. McCullough to invite her to become
a member of his own company the following
season, but the Museum management iiuluced
her to remain. Immediately following Mr.
McCullough, Harry J. Mt)ntague, leading man
at Wallack's Theatre, filled an engagement
as star at the Museum. Mrs. Kent's acting
in various roles won his attention to such
an extent that, with the consent of the manage-
ment, she accepted his offer to make a tour
of New England, supporting him in many of
the leading nMes of his repertoire.

Upon her return to the Museum she appeared
in a large number of important parts, and as
Valentine de Monias, in "A Celebrated Case,"
made a pronounced hit. The Museum of
those days was a busy place, and its superb
company found the hours available for prepa-
ration barely sufficient. Freciuently, for weeks
at a time, there would be a run of the glorious
Shakespearean tragedies and the standard
comedies, with almost nightly changes in the
bill. There were but few of these in which Mrs.
Kent did not appear, first in small roles and,
as her standing in the coni|)any advanced,
in higher ones. She had a remarkable capac-
ity for "quick study." Harry Murdoch was
said to be her only equal in this exiiausting
but often necessary effort. Many times, with
but two or three hours' notice, she came to
the aid of the management and played, letter-
perfect, long and sometimes leacHng parts.
In her third season the management recog-
nized her ability by engaging her for the lead-



ing heavy — that is, the leading tragic — roles,
but in addition she was frecjuently called upon
to appear in juvenile, ingenue, and even sou-
brette characters. When Madame Modjeska
came to the Museum, in 1S78, Mrs. Kent was
cast for the Princess de Bouillon, a part hardly
second to that of Adrienne Lecouvreur itself.
At the end of the great scene between the two
women, Madame Modjeska, at the final fall of
the curtain, taking both ber hands, thanked
her for "such splendid work." "Perhaps
nothing," says Mrs. Kent, "gave me more
happiness than when Mr. Longfellow asked
to meet me, and comjjlimented me in his gra-
cious and beautiful way." Madame Motljeska,
her husbantl. Count Bozenta, and their son
had but just bade the company farewell, when
Mr. Lawrence Barrett began a four weeks'
engagement, Mrs. Kent appearing in the cast
of nearly every play. In 1S79 he again filled
a fortnight's engagement, and Mrs. Kent,
whose work the year before had attracted his
attention, was again found in his support. As
Emilia to his lago (Mr. Barron as Othello and
Miss Clarke as Desdemona), Mrs. Kent made
the most brilliant success of her career thus
far. Mr. Barrett had himself coached her.
He showered congratulations upon her, and,
with the consent of the management, secured
her as leading lady for his New England tour.
She had, therefore, at this early stage in her
career, the privilege and distinction of appear-
ing in most of the leading female roles of iiis
extensive repertoire. I'pon returning from
this tour she supportetl Mr. Warren as Clara
Weigel in "My Son" and in many other pla\'s.
When the Union Square Theatre's great success,
"The Danicheffs," was produced at the Mu-
seum, to Mrs. Kent was apportioned the part
of the sixty-year.s-old Countess Danicheff,
created in New York by Miss Fanny Morant.
It seemed almost cruel to ask so young a girl
to impersonate this magnificent and imperious
elderly woman, but the critics accorded her
high praise, saying her "signally powerful
and effective work augurs for her a brilliant
future."

During her long engagement at the Museum
Mrs. Kent studied elocution at the Boston
School of Oratory. For five years she contin-



122



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



ued a member of the Museum company, and
then Mr. Bartley Campbell, who, unknown
to her, had for a week been watching her work
on the Museum stage, offered her the position
of leading lady in his "Galley Slave" company,
to succeed Miss Lillie Glover as Cicely Blaine.
It was a company of great strength, including
Joseph Wheelock, Marie Prescott, Junius Bru-
tus Booth, Frank E. Aiken, Owen Fawcett,
and other talented people. At the end of
this season Mrs. Kent was especially engaged
by Mrs. John Drew for the leading part of
Jeanne Guerin to Joseph Wheelock's Jagon.
While at Mrs. Drew's theatre she accepted an
offer from John Sleeper Clarke, Edwin Booth's
brother-in-law, and became leading lady of his
company. With him, as leading man, were
W. H. V^ernon, the distinguished English actor,
and Mrs. Farren. When John T. Raymond
produced "Colonel Sellers" in London, he
engaged Mrs. Kent for Laura Hawkins, but
her husband and father objected to her going,
and she was obliged to relinquish also an offer
from Mr. Clarke for a London appearance.
They were opportunities which would have
meant much to a young actress. The follow-
ing season she became leading woman with
Thomas W. Keene, being featured in the bills,
and for two years continued in this arduous
position, constantly travelling, and appear-
ing in all the principal cities in the United
States and Canada in a round of impersona-
tions, largely Shakespearean, among them being
Ophelia in "Hamlet," Portia in "The Merchant
of Venice," Desdemona in "Othello," Queen
Elizabeth in "Richard IIL"; Julie de Mor-
timer in "Richelieu," Fiordelisa in "The Fool's
Revenge." During this engagement she also
prepared for appearing as Mariana in "The
Wife" and Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet."
When Mr. John Stetson's New York Fifth
Avenue Theatre Company produced "Divorce,"
Mrs. Kent was selected for Fanny Davenport's
old part of IjOu Ten Kyck. Tlie i)lay had a
great cast, with Sarah Jewett as Fanny Ten
Eyck (formerly Clara Morris's role), Annie
Russell, Herbert Kelcey, and other New York
favorites equally distinguished. This was suc-
ceeded by "Confusion," simultaneously pro-
duced by two of Mr. Stetson's companies.



Mrs. Kent and Mr. Kelcey heading one. Mrs.
Kent starred for a season, appearing as Pauline
in "The Lady of Lyons," Nancy Sikes in
"Oliver Twist," and in other standard plays.
Among the hundreds of characters portrayed
by her have been Camille, Lady Macbeth, Mari-
ana in "The Wife," Galatea in "Pygmalion
and Galatea," Lady Lsabel in "East Lynne,"
Armande in " Led Astray," the title roles in
"Leah the Forsaken," "Lucretia Borgia,"
"Medea," "Evadne," and "Satan in Paris."
She was also leading lady and stock star of sev-
eral companies producing Paris, London, and
New York successes Although exceedingly
versatile, her temperament especially fitted her
for tragic and emotional roles, and it was in these
she won her greatest successes. Mr. Henry Aus-
tin Clapp, in passing judgment upon her work,
frequently spoke of her "personal distinction
and nobility of manner"; her "rare tempera-
ment, distinguished beauty, and the depth,
range, and expressiveness of her voice." An-
other eminent critic said of her work: "Entirely
unaffected and natural, it is of commanding
character. This young woman possesses mag
netism, tremendous underlying power, rare
intelligence, and great personal beauty. Few
will forget that mobile and sensitive face or
that picture of passion, tenderness, and de-
spair."

After twelve years of successful and often
brilliant work her health failed, just as she had
signed a three years' contract to appear as a
star. She was obliged to retire, and for some
years was an invalid. On account of Mr.
Kent's objections she has since then refused
all offers to reappear. She is interested in
literary work, writing under an assumed name.
She is active in patriotic work. A charter
member of the Colonel Timothy Bigelow Chap-
ter, Daughters of the American Revolution,
of Worcester, she has labored for its success
since its inception. Having refused to serve
longer as its Regent, she was this year elected
Honorary Regent for life. She is a mem-
ber of the AVorcester Woman's Club and of
the Club lIou.se Corporation, president of
the Worcester Revolutionary Memorial A.ssocia-
tion, vice-presitlent of the Worcester Society
of Antiquity, and a devoted member of

the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.

Mr. and Mrs. Kent give their leisure hours
to ethnological and genealogical research, in
which they have a coinuion interest and pleas-
ure. Some of her ancestral lines on the pa-
ternal side she has traced, beyond a doubt, to
the "Mayflower," and evidence at hand seems
to show that she is descended from nine mem-
bers of the Pilgrim band that landed on Plym-
outh Rock in December, 1620, namely.
Elder Brewster and his. wife Mary, William
Mullines (or Molines) and his wife, John and
Priscilla (xMuUines) Alden, William White
and his wife Susanna, and their son Resolved
White.

More than sixty of her New England ances-
tors in the colonial period served as military
officers, magistrates, Representatives, Depu-
ties, and founders of towns. Among them
(to note but a few) may here be mentioned
Major (also Colonel and Chief Justice) Francis
Fulham, the Rev. Joseph Emerson, Lieutenant
John Sharpe, Lieutenant Stephen Hall, Lieu-
tenant Criffin Craft, Lieutenant Moses Crafts,
the Rev. Peter Bulkcley, the Rev. P^dward
Bulkk^y, Captain Christopher Hussey, Robert
Vose, Lieutenant James Trowbridge, Robert
Taft, and Tliomas Cregson, Assistant of the
Colony, first Treasurer, and first Connnissioner
for the LTnion with other New England Colonies.
Three were in the Revolution, Captain .lo.seph
Hall serving throughout * the war. Captain
Christoi)h('r Hus.sey, above mentioned, was ap-
pointed by the King (Charles IL), September
IS, 1671), a memlx'r of the King's Council antl
Court of Judicature of New Hampshiri", and so
served until the appointment of Cranhekl as
Lieutenant-governor in 1682.

Her mother's ancestry also includes many
distinguished families.

Mr. and Mrs. Kent reside in Worcester, where
he is Register of Deeds for Worcester District.
His recently published book, "Land Records;
A System of Lulexing," is tlie first book ever
written \x\)0\\ this intricate subject. Mr. Kent
is a member of the Sons of the Revolution, the

Society of Antiquity.



HARRIET NEWELL FLINT.— Mrs.
Harriet N. Flint came of the good
okl Puritan stock that peopletl the
shores of Massachusetts in the early
days of the seventeenth century. She was the
sixth child and third daughter of Thomas and
Phebe (Cummings) Evans, and was born in
South Reading, now Wakefield, Mass., August
29, 1815. She died in Wakefield, Decemlier
31, 1896, the last survivor of her father's family
of nine children.

The house of her h)irth was a modest and
ancient-looking domicile on the northerly side
of Salem Street, which was many years ago
removed to give place to the residence erected
by her brother, Lucius B. Evans, and nf)W
owned and occupied by his son, Harvey B.
Evans.

Mrs. Flint on her father's side was descended
from Nathaniel Evans, who with his father,
Henry Evans, came from Wales about two and
a half centuries ago, and .settleil in that part
of Maiden afterward annexed to the town of
Reading and now known as the village of
Greenwood. On her mother's side Mrs. Flint
was connected with some of the leading fami-
lies of Woburn. The early life of Mrs. Flint
was surrounded with good influences, and she
was taught to cherish high ideals and to do
good to others. Receivetl into the Baptist
church at the age of sixteen, she remained
steadfast in her faith during her long and ac-
tive life. Her education was obtained in th(!
public schools of her native town. Her eager
mind and studious habits enabled her to accu-
mulate a valuable store of information, which,
united with her native connnon .sense and good
judgment, carried her successfully through the
varied experiences and responsibilities she was
in later years called upon tf) meet.

In 1840 the subject of this sketch left her
home to become the wife of Charles Frederick
Flint, of North Reading, whose accjuaintance
she had made while teaching school in that
village. Mr. Flint was a worthy representa-
tive of an old and honoraljle famih , being a (k'-
scendant in the sixth generation of Thomas
Flint, an early settler at Salem Village, and a
nephew of the Rev. Timothy Flint, of Lunen-
burg, a pioneer in American letters. He was



124



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



brought up on the extensive farm of his father,
gaining only a conunon-school eckication, and
himself became an excellent farmer. A man
of nmch force of character, with practical sa-
gacity heightened by judicious reading and dili-
gent improvement of the means within his
reach, he gained influence and respect among
his fellow-citizens. Ho added lands and money
to his patrimony, and, when the Salem and
Lowell Ra'.lroad was laid out through North
Reading, his public spirit and private interest
induced him to become a large subscriber to
its capital stock. When the fate of the enter-
prise trembled in the Imlance, he put his shoul-
der to the wheel, and by his energy and means
was largely instrumental in its successful
launching and development. He became a
director and the president of the corporation,
while the enhancement in value of its stock
added much to his fortune. Dying in the ma-
turity of his powers, at the age of sixty years,
from the results of an accidental fall, he be-
queathed the bulk of his wealth to his wife,
they having had no children. She was made
executrix of the will.

Mrs. Flint in her bereavement and sorrow
found herself thus unexpectedly confronted
with important and pressing responsibilities,
which she met with courage and resolution, as
duties to be performed. Her well-trained fac-
ulties and resources of mind and character en-
abled her to assume and successfully fulfil all
the requirements of her position. Her keen
insight, her tact and energy, her thoughtful
judgment, and great business capacity were
wonderfully manifest in all the affairs that
from this time entered into her life-work.
These ciualities enabled her not only to hold
undiminished the extensive estate left to her
charge, but to more than double the original
value of the property.

Not long after her husband's death Mrs.
Flint returned to her native town, and made
her home on an estate Mr. Flint had owned on
Main Street. Here in a house beautifully lo-
cated, overlooking Crystal J^ake and the cen-
tral portions of Wakefield, she continued to re-
side during the remaining years of her life. On
this homestead farm she laid out a street, nam-
ing it Charles Street, in remembrance of her



husband. The estate consisted of twenty-four
acres, including the sightly elevation known as
"Hart's Hill," which with its picturesque sur-
roundings has since the death of Mrs. Flint
been acquired by the town by purchase as a
public park, and will in time become a charming
resort.

Though removed from North Reading, Mrs.
Flint cherished a loving remembrance of the
town as having been the birthplace and lifelong
home of her husband, and because of her own
personal and pleasant a.ssociations with the
kindly and intelligent people of the old " North
Precinct," as it was known in the early days,
when Wakefield, Reading, and North Reading
were united in one municipality.

On this town of her love Mrs. Flint bestowed
her tangible blessings in a golden shower, not
in any unconsidered and impulsive way, but
only after calm forethought and deliberation,
seeking to ascertain what gifts would be of
greatest and most lasting value. The first re-
sults of her kindly thouglitfulness were mani-
fest in laying the foundation for a public library.
By the provisions of her husband's will the sum
of one thousand dollars was to be offered to
the town of North Reading, the income thereof
to be used in the purchase of medals for excel-
lence in the public schools. The execution of
this laudable jnu'pose having l)een found im-
practicable, Mrs. Flint, with the willing co-
operation of the town, turned this becjuest into
a gift to form the nucleus of a public liljrary.
To this gift she soon after added two thousanil
dollars and later one thousaml dollars more,
to be a permanent fund, the income of which
should be amuially devoted "for the benefit
of said library."

In accepting the gift, the town adopted the
following resolutions: "Resolved, That we, as
a town, herel)y express to Mrs. Harriet N.
Flint our grateful appreciation of the warm
interest she has taken in the prosperity of our
town, the culture of its citizens, and the edu-
cation of our youth.

"Resolved, That we also gratefully recog-
nize her interest in our welfare, as shown in
her original gift of one thousand dollars to
establish a library, and in adding to that gift
two thousand dollars as a perpetual fund, to



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



125



tje known as iho Flint Memorial Fvuul, the in-
terest of which is to be yearly expended in
ailding to the Flint Library."

The year 1S75 was signalized by the crown-
ing act of Mrs. Flint's consistent generosity
in the gift to her adopted town of the commo-
dious and comely structure since known as
the Flint Memorial Hall. The edifice is pleas-
antly situated in the centre of the town, and
admirably adapted to the uses for which it is
designed. The first story contains the Flint
Library and the nmnicipal offices; the second
story has a spacious, well-lighted hall, with a
gallery and ante-rooms; and the ui)per floor,
a large banquet room and other conveniences.
At its dedication the Hon. George B. Loring,
of Salem, tlelivered the principal address, fol-
lowed by the Hon. Charles L. Flint and the
Rev. Granville 8. Abbott.

The nmnificent and oi)portune gifts already
mentioned were not by any means the measure
of Mrs. Flint's generosity to this favored town.
It was her helping hand that lightened the
burden of the war debt upon the tax-payers,
that assisted struggling cluu'ches over hard
places, and contributed to keep the roadways
of the town in a sui)erior condition. The high
school, which the town was not l)y law retpiired
to maintain, would have long since ceased to be,
had not Mrs. Flint again anil again come to its
support. By her will she gave to the town
three thousand dollars, the income of which
shoukl be applied in caring for and improving
the Memorial Hall, and she also made liijcral
bequests to the different churches.

The generous thoughts and sympathies of
Mrs. Flint were not confined within narrow
limits, nor her benefactions restricted to the
' domain and residents of North Reading. In
Wakefield, the town of her earlier and later
life, she was constantly active in plans and
deeds for others' benefit. Every humane,
philanthropic, or educational enterijrise in the
conuuunity enlisted her interest and concern,
and, if her judgment approveil, secured from
her a substantial ilonation. She gave to the
town for the support of the Beebe Town Li-
brary the sum of one thousand dollars, which
the trustees set apart as the Flint Memorial
Fund, the income only being used for the pur-



chase of books. She manifested her friendship
for the public schools, the fire department, and
disabled soldiers and their families in .substan-
tial ways, contritnited to the improvement of
highwa3's and establi.shment of drinkirtg foun-
tains, and helped the local religious societies
in times of need. She was open to every call
of charity and voice of tlistress, but her deepest
.sympathies, in her later years, were called forth
and centred in the organization and operation
of that noble charity, the A^'akefield Home for
Aged Women, incorporated in 1895. Her
heart and mind and ))urse were in this benefi-
cent movement from its beginning. Each year
she delighted to give it an added impulse, and,
dying, she bestowed upon it in her will an earn-
est, practical benediction in the sum of five
thousand dollars, she having previously assisted
its funds in an ecpial amount. She was made
honorary president of the corporation. Many
other ladies and gentlemen have, by their labors,
coun.sel, gifts, -anti sacrifices, aided to make the
Wakefield Home a blessed and highly prized
institution of the town.

The last will and testament of Mrs. Flint
clearly indicated that the benevolence, religious
devotion, and public spirit that had actuated
all the years of her widowhood burned brightly
to the end of her days, as she bequeathctl over
one hundred thousand ilollars to various re-
ligious and benevolent organizations. It is
worthy of especial mention, as illustrating her
fervent patriotism, that in her will she gave to
the town of Wakefield in trust, with provisions
for its ultimate application towaril the erection
of a soldiers' monument, the sum of ten thou-
sand dollars, ".such monument to be grand in
itself, symmetrical in architecture, beautiful in
design and finish, attended with solid ami
thorough workmanship, worthy of the brave
men to whom we dedicate it."

Mrs. Flint had expressetl a desire and \nir-
pose to give to the Massachusetts State Board
of Metropolitan Park Commissioners the home-
steatl antl farm on which she lived, including
"Hart's Hill," for u.ses of a public park, but
the sudden prostration of her last illness pre-
vented the carrying out of her gracious int(&gt;nt.
The innumerable acts of personal and uno.s-
tentatious benevolence that characterized her

daily life iiuist be dismissed from this sk(&gt;tc'li
with but a passing allusion. They are in a
manner sacred from even a friendly pen. !She
souglit not tlie praise of men.

Mrs. Flint was essentially a rejiresentative
jiroduet of our New England civilization. Lib-
eral, ungrudging, and wisely discriminating in
her charities, her domestic life was distingiushed
by a simi&gt;licity, thrift, and independence, ac-
companied with a cordial hospitalit)', affording
a true index to her character, and demonstrat-
ing her Puritan descent and training.

Such a woman as Mrs. Flint is a blessing to
any comnuinity and an honor to humanity.
Her memory will be cherished with grateful
affection and genuine respect in the towns
where her influence and good deeds have been
best known and her personal ([ualities appre-
ciated, while in the wider circle of those who
have been told of her gracious character and
no])le philanthropy will her name be treasured
with reverence and admiration.

In the little cemetery at North Reading, not
many rods from the home once so dear to her,
lies the body of Harriet N. Flint beside that
of her husband.

JULIA K. DYER, widely known and be-
loved as Mrs. Micah Dyer, lias been asso-
ciated for over foi'ty years with nearly
every large philanthropic work started
in Boston, serving in every office she has been
appointed to with noble un.selfishness. Her
maiden name was Julia Knowlton. She was
born August 25, ]S2'J, in Deei-field, N.H.,
near the birthphice of General Benjamin l'\
Butler. Her parents were Joseph and Susan
(Dearborn) Knowlton. The iunnigrant progen-
itor of the Knowlton family of New lOngland
was Captain William Ivnowlton, who died on
the voyage from London to Nova Scotia, and
whose sons a few years later settled at Ipswich,
Mass., the earliest to arrive there, it is said,
being John in Ifi.SO.

Through her maternal grandfather, Nathan-
iel Dearborn, who married Comfort Palmer,
of Haverhill, Mrs. Dyer is descended from
Godfrey Dearborn, who came from l^igland



and was one of the earliest .settlers of E.xeter,
N.H., in IG'.ii), and later removed to Hampton,
N.H.

Her great-grandfather, I^dward Dearborn,
fought at the battle of Bunker Hill, as did
her paternal grandfather, Thomas Knowl-
ton. In the Revolutionary Rolls of New
Ham])shire, Ivlward Dearl)orn is named as
a pri\'ate in Caj)tain Benjamin Titcomb's
company in 1775; as a .soldier from Dover in
the Continental army in A])ril, 1776: in Cap-
tain Drew's company, February, 1777; on the
pay-roll of Captain Nathan Sanborn's com-
pany. Colonel Evans's regiment, which marched
September, 1777, from New Hampshire to
re-enforce the Northern Continental army at
Saratoga; also sometime member of the Fifth
Company, Second New Hampshire Continental
Regiment, which was commanded by Colonel
George Reid, 1777-79.

Edward Dearborn married Susanna Brown,
whom he left, when he entered the arn^y, to
care for the farm and three small children,
the nearest neighbor being ten miles away.
Su.sanna Brown was the daughter of Nehemiah
and Amy (Longfellow) Brown, of Kensington,
N.H., and grand-daughter of Nathan Long-
fellow. The last named was probably the
Nathan born in 1690, .son of William and Anne
(Sewall) Longfellow, of Newbury, Mass., and
brother of Stephen, born in 1681, from whom
the poet Henry A\'. Longfellow was descended.

Jo.seph Knowlton, Mrs. Dyer's father, was
a soldier in the A\'ar of 1S12, and her brother,
Jo.sejjh H. Knowlton, in the Civil War. The
patriotism of Mrs. Dyer is thus shown to be
inh(-rited.

During her infancy hei' parents removed to
Concord, N.H., and in lS:i9 they took up their
residence in Manchestei', N.H., where for twenty
years her father was connected with the Land
and Water Company, besides tilling important
positions of trust. Up to the ag(&gt; of fourteen
h(&gt;r education was gained in private schools.
She then went to a boarding-school ii\ Concord,
N.H., where she remaineil one year, after which
she entered the New Ham])t()n Institute,
known at that time as one of the best schools
for girls in the country, from which she was grad-
uated with honors before the age of eighteen.

Returning to Manchester, she taught in the
high school for one year French, EngHsh,
Latin, and the higher mathematics. Asso-
ciated with her at this school was Miss Caroline
C. Johnson, who afterward came to Boston
and established a school for girls on Bowdoin
Street, which she kept for twenty years. Miss
Johnson was a cousin of John G. Whittier.
It was with her and her sisters that the jjoet
in his later years made his home at Oak Knoll,
Danvers.

At this period Miss Knowlton met Mr. Micah
Dyer, Jr., then a rising young lawyer of Boston.
After a short engagement they were married.
May 1, 1851, and took up their residence in
Boston. Ten years later they ])urchased the
fine estate which for a generation had belonged
to the Clapp family, at Upham's Corner, Dor-
chester. The house is situated on an elevation,
and is surrounded by carefully kej)t lawns,
with shade trees, many of which are more than
one hundred years old. It is an interesting
fact that the first tulip bulbs brought U) America
were planted in this garden.

Family duties occupied all of Mrs. Dyer's
time during the first ten years of her married
life; but as the children grew up — and she was
blessed with three, two sons and one daughtei-
— she found time for the demands of charitable
work. During the Civil War she, with scores
of other brave women, did what she could
to alleviate the sufferings of the soldiers. An
amusing incident recently appeared in the
Boston papers, in which Mrs. Dyer figures as
having fired a shot in the war — not a bullet
shot, however, and, so far from doing any
deadly injury, it saved a man's life. \\'hil(&gt;
riding in a slow Southern train, she passed
in the early morning through a strip of terri-
tory picketed by I'nion men. It was a dan-
gerous section, and the train was barely creep-
ing along. Mrs. Dyer, all alert, was gazing
out of the window on the lookout for danger,
when she e.spied a soldier asleep at his post,
an offence punishable by death if discovered.
He had evidently been overcome by fatigue.
Could nothhig be done to save him'' She was
on her way to one of the hospitals with deli-
cacies for the soldiers there. Among the.se
were oranges. She seized one, and, with an



accuracy of aim gained from a youthful fond-
ness for archery, hit him scjuarcly in the chest,
arousing him instantly. After a bewildered
moment he sjirang to his feet, then, catching
sight of his deliverer, who was waving to him
from the dei)arting train, he bowed his heart-
felt thanks, orange in hand.

The first |)ublic work of Mrs. Dyer was on
the Board of Management of the Dedham
Home for Discharged Female Prisoners, to
which she was appointed in 1864. For twenty-
eight years she never failed, except during
serious illness, to pay her monthly visit, ^\'llen
the Ladies' Aid Society was formed to aid the
Soldiers' Home, Mrs. Dyer was made its sec-
retary, and the next year, 1882, its pre.'^ident,
a position that she held for ten years. The
military strain in Mrs. Dyer's blooil fitteil her
peculiarly for this office. Under her gui&lt;lance
the numbers rapidly increaseil, and thousands
of dollars were raised to give comforts to the
home. The society has furnished rooms, pro-
vided a library and all sorts of smaller luxuries.
A fine portrait of the "right bowei' of the Sol-
diers' Home" (as the trustees call Mrs. Dyer)
hangs in the chapel of the home, and one of
the rooms is set apart and named for her.

Her rare executive ability combined with
an even temperament makes her a natural
leader of large bodies. During her presidency
of the Ladies' Aitl she comlucted several fairs,
which netted handsome sums. The Ladies'
Aid table at tlie Soldiers' Carnival under her
direction cleareil nearly six thoasaml dollars.
Later a kettledrum for the .same benefit netted
four thousand dollars, anil another fair for the
Soldiers' Home netted ten thousand dollars.
For this fair some one facetiously offered,
when told they could give anything tliey chose,
a live pig. Mrs. Dyer, readily .seeing a novel
feature for her fair, accepted the offer. Piggy
was comfortably ensconced in an improvi.sed
]X'n, presiding over a box inscribed with bright
ver.ses from this lady's fertile brain, inviting
contributions for his maintenance. Tliirty
tlollars was realized from this exhibit. Then
the pig was .sent to tiie Soitfifrs' Home, where
in the cour.se of time he was served.

The Boston Educational and Industrial
Union in 1885 asked Mrs. Dyer to take charge



128



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



of an entertainment for its benefit, and she
arranged a Dickens Carnival, which brought
in seven thousand tlollars. In 1S8S Mrs. Dyer
was at the heati of the Board of Managers of
the great fair held in Music Hall by which the
sum of thirteen thousand dollars was raised in
a single week for the benefit of The Home for
Intemperate Women.

The Charity Club of Boston, which ha"s
become so well known, was the outgrowth
of this fair. The committee of fifty women
who had worked so successfully and harmoni-
ously under Mrs. Dyer's guidance banded
themselyes together to raise money for any
good object. Mrs. Dyer conceived the idea
of starting a free hospital for respectable women
witliout means in need of important surgical
operations. A house at 3&lt;S Chester Park was
bought, and a hospital started when the Club
had not a cent in its treasury. How the
owner was induced to take a mortgage for a
sum less than he had asked for the projjerty,
leaving the Club an equity for nothing, how
man}' ingenious devices were resorted to to
furnish, to pay interest, taxes, and running
expenses, only the Club members know; but
the good work went on and prosperetl. The
president, whose faith was so great, buoyed
up the others.

In 1892 a new hospital was completed at
Parker Hill, between Brookline and Boston.
The Legislature subsequently granted fifteen
thousand dollars, which cleared off its in-
debtedness. The Club now numbers nearly
seven hundretl members, and this hospital
stands a proutl monument of their good work.
Mrs. Dyer has been the president from the first.
The badge of the Club is a circular pin sur-
mounted with the head of the presitleiit in
bronze.

Mrs. Dyer is the organizer antl president
of the Wintergreen Club, to which only women
of fifty are eligible. It is named for the real
wintergreen, which is green and glossy under
the snow, retaining its youthful freshness, as
good women do. Among its members are
Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Maria H.
Bray, Mrs. Kate Tannatt Woods, and Mrs.
Louis Prang.

Another little society which Mrs. Dyer ini-



tiated a few years ago is the "Take Heed,"
from the text, "Take heed that ye speak not
evil of one another." She is also president of
the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of
Lipham's Corner, an office she has filled for
seven years, being its second president, re-
signing at one time, and accepting the office
again in 1899. She is a valued member and
one of the boaril of directors of the Castilian
Club, and a life member of tlie Bostonian
Society. Among other societies and clubs
with which she has been actively connected
may be named the Moral Education Society,
the National Prison Association, the Benefit
Society for the University Education of Women,
the Helping Hand Society, the Dorchester
\\'omaii's Clul), and the Book Review C'lub
of Dorchester, the last-named two being strictly
literary clubs. It has been estinnited that some-
thing like a ([uarter of a million has been raised
for charities through her inspiring lead rship.

Early inclined to literary work, foi which
the duties that came to lier left little time, Mrs.
Dyer has written, mainly for her clubs, in her
■scant leisure, many acce|)table essays and
poems. Her one great grief has been the
loss of her husband, whose hearty support she
had in all of her undertakings. Since his death,
November 24, 1898, she has made her home
with her son and his wife, on Columliia Road,
Dorchester, having her own suite of rooms,
where she still continues to tlispen.se her bomi-
tiful hospitality.

Mrs. Livermore, in her cliaracteristic, im-
pulsive way, summing up Mrs. Dyer's amiable
qualities, says, " I always think of her as al-
ways cheery, always charming, always harmo-
nious, and altogethei' the most delightful woman
of my acquaintance."



AUGUSTA WALKER STANLE\^ of

X. jL serving her third term as Regent of
the Sarah Hall Chajjter, Daughters of
the Revolution, was born in New Portland, Me.,

Captain Solomon Walker died in Woolwich
(formerly Pownalborough) Me., July 21, 1789,
aged sixty-nine years. As stated on his tomb-
stone, he was born in Berwick, Me. He is sup-
posed to have been the son of John Walker,
who commanded the blockhouse in Berwick at
the time of the Indian hostilities.

In the State archives of Massachusetts (in
the Revolutionary Rolls) Solomon Walker ap-
pears in a list of ofhcers of the Massachu-
setts militia as Cajjtain in the Eleventh Com-
pany of the First Lincoln County Regiment,
commissioned July 1, 1776 (book, "Militia,
Officers, etc.," vol. xxviii.).

general Watlsworth. luilisted April 2S, 1780;
discharged December 6, 1780; service, seven
months nine days ("Service at Eastern Ports,"
"Various Service," vol. xxiv.).

Solomon Walker also appears in a regimental
return dated Georgetown, November 19, 1779,
made by Lieutenant Colonel Dununer Sewall,
of Colonel Sanuie! McCobli's (Lincoln County)
regiment, as Captain Eleventh Company, com-
missioned September 17, 1776. Residence,
Woolwich.

Mrs. Stanley's mother, Mary D. Witham be-
fore marriage, was a daughter of William
Witham and his wife, Abigail Woodman, and
on the maternal side, grand-daughter of John
Woodman, Jr., whose father, John Woodman,
was one of the earliest settlers of New Glouces-
ter, Me., going there from Kingston, N.H.,
early in the sixth decade of the eighteenth
century. The elder John Woodman, John,*
was a descendant in the fifth generation of



Edward' Woodman, wlu; settled at Newbury,
Mass., in 1685, and who served as Deputy to
the General Court in 1686 and three later
years. The line continued through Edward^;
Deacon Archelaus''; Joshua,* born in 1708, who
married Eunice Sawyer, of Newbury, and re-
moved to Kingston, N.I I., about the year
1736; to their son John,^ born in 1740, who
married Sarah Page, of Salislniry, Mass., and
removed, as above noted, to New Gloucester,
Me. John Woodman, Jr., or John," son of
John^ and his wife Sarah, was born in New
Gloucester in 17()7. He was married three
times, and had eighteen children. His daughter
Abigail, born in 1801, was married to William
Witham in September, 1819.

Augusta M. ^\'alkeI• (Mrs. Stanley) received
her education in the public school, being grad-
uated from the high .school of her native town
and later attending the State Normal School
at Farmington. For several years following
she was a successful teacher. On New Year's
Day, 1870, she wa,s marrieil to Francis Edgar
Stanley, and went to Auburn, Me., to reside.
Mr. Stanley, wlio is an inventor, has been for
the greater part of his business life associated
with his twin brother, Freelan Oscar Stanley.
The Stanley lirothers' dry [elates in photography
and the Stanley automobiles have a world-wide
reijutation, and the men behind these are not
only powers because of their wealth, but by
rea.son of their long years of business integrity.
After .seventeen years' residence in AuburUj
Me., Mr. and Mrs. Stanley removed to Newton,
Mass., where they still live. They have two
slaughters, Blanche May and Emily Frances,
and one son, Raymond Walker, a promising
lad yet in school.

Blanche May Stanley was married October
15, 1908, to Edwanl Meiihew Hallett. They
reside in Newton.

Emily Frances Stanley was married Ajjril 8,
1896, to Prescott Warren, of Cambridge, Mass.
Mr. and Mrs. Warren resitle in Newton. Tliey
have two daughters: Margery, boi-n in 1S97;
and Frances Augusta, born in 1900.

Mrs. Stanley has travelled extensively, both
in her own country and abroad. She takes an
active interest in tlie educational, patriotic,
and philanthropic movements of the day. The

ciety of the Daughters of the Revolution.
Mrs. Stanley is also one of the Board of Mana-
gers of the (ieneral Society. She is a vice-
presiflent of the Social Science Club of Newton,
and was one of the founders and for a time
vice-jiresident of the Katahdin Club, conqiosed
of residents of Newton who were born in Maine.
Mrs. Stanley for some years was president of
the Newton District Nursing Association. On
account of severe illness not long ago she de-
clinctl re-election. This u.seful .society com-
prises four huntlred members. Both Mr. and
Mrs. Stanley are regular attendants of the Uni-
tarian church in Newton, in which she is an
active worker.



HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD,
successful author in prose and verse,
was born in Calais, Me., April 3, 1835,
the eldest child of .Tose|)h N. and
Sarah (Bridges) Prescott. Her father, Jo.seph
N. Prescott, was a son of A\'illiam Pei)perell
Prescott and his wife, Harriet de Les Dernier,
whose father, Peter F. C. de Les Dernier, was
born in Halifax, N.S., of Swiss parents.

Henry Prescott, father of \\'illiam P. Pres-
cott, was a lineal descendant, in the fourth gen-
eration, of John Prescott, an early .settler of
Jjancaster, Ma.ss. Mary Newmarch Prescott,
wife of Henry, was a daughter of Joseph and
Dorothy (Pepperell) Newmarch, a granrl-daugh-
ter of William' Pepperell, of Kittery, and
niece of Sir Willianr' Pepperell, the victor of
Louisburg.

The .second Prescott ancestor, Captain Jon-
athan,^ father of the Rev. Benjamin Prescott
and grandfather of his son Henry, named above,
married Elizabeth Hoar, sister of Daniel Hoar,
remote ancestor of Senator George F. Hoar.

Mrs. Spofford's mother was a daughter of
John Bridges, of Calais, Me.

Mrs. Rose Terry Cof)ke, in bygone years a
fellow-worker with the pen, thus wrote of
Harriet Prescott in her girlhood in Maine: A
"lithe, active child, full of (juaint wit and keen
questioning, she ran wild through her earlier



years in the pure air and fragrant breath of
pine forests and sea breezes, laying the founda-
tion of her exce]itional health and strength."

At the age of fourteen Harriet Prescott went
to Newburyport to live with an aunt and attend
the Putnam Free School, "a remarkably good
school," as it has been desciibed, "kept by
William G. Wells, a celebrated teacher." Her
native talent soon manifested itself: she re-
ceived the first prize, in a series instituted by
Thomas AVentworth Higginson and Professor
Aljiheus Crosby, "for a very daring anil orig-
inal e,s.say on Handet, written at sixteen." She
further attaineil an enviable distinction and
popularity among her classmates by writing
several dramas, which were enacted in the school
exhibitions. After her graduation from the
Putnam School she continued her studies for
a time at Pinkerton Academy in Derry, N.H.,
where her widowed mother and the younger
children were then living. Before long the
family returned to Newburyport.

Not admiring friends and schoolmates alone,
but judicious counsellors, among them Colonel
Higginson, encouraged her literary aspirations.
Sketches, stories, and verses from her pen found
their way into print, and probably brought
money into her purse.

Her first contribution to the Atlantic Montldy,
"In a Cellar," appearing in February, 1859, is
remembei'ed l)y one who.se opinion is of value
as "an ingenious and amusing story, well told."
Tlie .same early reader and critic adds: "Her
tale of 'The Amber Gods,' published soon after-
ward in the same magazine, was of a higher
and larger scope, full of power and passion.
Scarcely less powerful was a sketch named ' Cir-
cumstance.' These stories at once gained for
the author a high place among writers of fic-
tion."

She continued to use her pen. To quote
again from Mrs. Cooke: " Under her quiet aspect,
wistful regard, and shy manner, lay a soul full
of imagination and pa.ssion and a nature that
revelled in the use of words to express this fire
and force. In her hands the English language
became sonorous, gorgeous, burning."

In 1865 Harriet Prescott was married to
Richard S. Spofford, of Newburyport. Joy in
the birth of a child in the ensuing year was

followed a few months later l)y sorrow for its
loss. With the exception of some time spent
in Washington, D.C., the home of Mrs. vSpof-
ford has been on Deer Island, between New-
biiryport and Amesbury. Here Mr. Spofford
died in August, LSSS. Several winter seasons
of recent years Mrs. Spofford has passed in
Boston. In the sunmier.of 1908 she went to
Europe with her sister, her niece, and her ward,
sailing on the same steamer witii her friend,
Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, in her annual
visit to England. The present winter (1903-
190-1) she is in Paris.

Mrs. S])offord as a writer is exceptionally
happy in her estimates and appreciations of
other women authors and their work: witness,
for example, the biographical sketch appearing
over her signature in another part of this
book, her criticism of the poems of Anne AVhit-
ney in the NortJi Ameiican Re&lt;ie&gt;v for 1860, and
her article on "The Author of Charles Auches-
ter," in the Atlnntic Monthlij, June, 1S62.

Among her books may here be mentioned,
not to give an exhaustive list: "Sir Rohan's
Ghost," "Azarian," "New I'jigland Legends,"
"Art Decoration," "The Servant Question,"
"Hester Stanley at Saint Mark's," "Poems,"
"In Titian's Garden," "Ballads about Au-
thors," "The Children of the Valley" (1901),
"The Great Procession" (1902).

Her most recent work in the Athmtic (Novem-
ber and December, 1903), "The Story of the
Queen," a short novel in two chapters, is one
that could hardly have been written before the
dawn of the twentieth century, and would
never have been written, just so felicitously and
out of the heart, by any other pen than that
of Mrs. Spofford, idealist.

"I read it with delight," says Mrs. Moulton,
referring to this story, and adding these words
to emphasize her admiration for Mrs. Spofford
as a poet as well as a story writer: "There is
a far-reaching grandeur of thought and imag-
ination in her poetic work. To lyric grace and
charm she adds breadth of view and nobility
of conception. She is neighbor to the stars.
The blind poet, Philip Bourke Marston, was a
great admirer of her work, as are many other
English I'eaders of high degree, among them the
professor of poetry at the University of (Jx-



fonl. She is a poet of deep emotion, of far-
reaching vision, of sjjlendid power."

But beyond all the literary graces and achieve-
ments of Mrs. Spofford — and it is a pleasant
note to close with — this same gifted contem-
porary and intimate friend appreciates " her
noble womanhood, her unselfish devotion to her
family and her friends, her loyalty to all high
and noble ideals."

EAMMA ELIZABITH BROWN, artist
I and writer, was born in Concord, N.H.,
J October 18, 1847, daughter of John
Frost and Elizabeth (Evans) Brown.
Her father had no sons, his brother Hemy
(also deceased) never married, and, her gran&lt;l-
father Brown having been an only son, Miss
Brown is the last of her line to bear the family
name. As stated by the late Henry Brown,
who was a genealogist, this family of Brown
in New England is of German origin and the
early spelling of the name was Braun.

Through her [laternal grandmother, Mrs.
Susannah Frost Brown, Miss Brown traces
her descent from Eihuund Frost, Ruling Elder
of the church in Cambridge, Mass. Elder
Frost, said to have lieen son of John Frost,
of Ipswich, England, came over in the ship
"Great Hope" in 1635, and was made freeman
at Cambridge, March 3, 1636. He died in
July, 1672. In his will, which was probated
in October following, he left bequests to his
widow Reana (his .second wife), each of his
eight children, something to the new college
(Harvard) then buililiiig at Cambridge, and
to George Alcock, a student. Much time was
spent by Mr. Henry Brown in England, look-
ing up the records of the Frost family.

Mi.ss Brown's father, John Frost Brown, for
many years a leading bookseller in Concord,
N.H., was an ardent lover of beauty, whether
in nature or art. During her girlhood, as she
took long outdoor tiamps with him, he taught
her to note the changing i)eauties of sky and
land and sea, which in later years she has been
.so skilful in reproducing on canvas. During
his bu.sy life he collected a large library of val-
uable books. He was a givat reader himself.

and he directecl her reading, which dwelt mostly
on outdoor themes and stories of goklen deeds
in ancient and modern history. This reading
has borne fruit in the many interesting volumes
to which Miss Brown's name is attached.

Her mother, Elizabeth Evans, was also of
English descent, but her family record shows
more practical business men than scholars.
She herself hatl great executive ability and an
energetic temperament. Her parents were Ar-
temas and Margaret (Sargent) . Evans. The
latter, Miss Brown's grandmother, lived to be
more than a hundred years old, and when she
was ninety-two had four sisters living who
were over ninety. Only two of the five, how-
ever, reached the century mark, and none of
the later generation showed any striking lon-
gevity.

Miss Brown has made a name for herself
with botli pen and brush. Well-trained in
the Concord schools, she was always a student
at home and a keen observer as she travelled.
She is a versatile woman, and one turns with
delight from her jiaintings to her histories,
her poems, her clever illustrating.

Her magazine stories — many under the pseu-
donym " B. E. E." — have a grace ami tender-
ness which are apt to send one back for sec-
ond reading. Her biographies of Washington,
Grant, Ciarfield, and Oliver Wendell Holmes
are in steady demand. "Huldah," her book
of patriotic verse, dedicated to a member of
the I). A. R., is read with appreciation by
lovers of graceful poetry. To change slightly
the author's own lines about another, it may
well be said that Miss Brown, "among New
Ham])shire's daughters, stanch and strong,
has made her name well known, both for her
story and her song."

As described by a friend, Miss Brown's i)er-
sonality is graceful and charming. The eyes
are remarkable — deep as the violets she so
beautifully paints, with long dark lashes. Her
presence diffuses swfH'tness and strength, and
to have met her once is to always long to know
her more intimately.

Not over robust, Mi.ss Brown is unable to
keep as busy as her ambition would direct.
The demand for her charming water-colors
exceeds the supply. At her exhibition a year



ago the favorite pictures were scenes at the
Azores, where Mi.ss Brown has passed much
vacation time. This year (1903) she has busily
sketched along the Massachusetts coast. Few,
indeed, are they who can depict life in two ways,
on glowing canvas and printed page; but Miss
Brown holds the secret of both arts.



SARAH CORDELIA FISHER WELL-
INGTON, a Massachu.setts woman, bet-
ter known as Mrs. Austin C. Wellington,
extensively engaged in works of phi-
lanthropy and patriotism, is a native resident
of Cambridge, Mass. Her father, George Fisher,
who died September 12, ISDN, was for many
years one of the leading citizens in the I'ni-
versity City. He was a son of Jabez" Fi-sher
and a lineal descendant in the seventh genera-
tion of Anthony' Fisher, wjio came to New
England in 1637 and settled at Dedham. Some
of the early Fishers at Dedham, among them
Joshua,' brother of Anthony,' used a seal bear-
ing a coat of arms described as "azure, a dol-
phin embowed naiant or" (Fisher Genealogy).

George Fisher was a deep thinker, strong in
his anti-slaver}- and temperance convictions,
and was an enthusiast in music. Buying the
Cambridge Chronicle in 1859, he continued its
editor and proprietor till 1873, when he sold
it. He was a member of the Harvard Law
School Association. In 1885 he represented
his tlistrict in the Massachusetts Legislature.
He married in 1840 Haimah Cordelia, daughter
of Samuel P. and E^unice (Swan) Teele, of
Charlestown, and a descendant of old Middle-
sex County families. Mrs. Fisher also was en-
dowed with musical talents. She was well
known and loved for her kindly nature, her
large philanthropic work dining the Civil War,
and her helpfulness among the poor up to tlie
time of her death, July 3, 1894. She was a
member of the Austin Street I'nitarian C'hurch.

Mrs. \\'ellington's education was received in
the public schools of Candiridge, including the
high school, where she was graduated, and in
Profes.sor Louis Aga.ssiz's School lor Young
Ladies, of which Mrs. Agassiz was director.
She subsecjuently contimied her studies of
nmsic at home and abroad, in London being

the pupil of Signor Randeggei- and Madame
Rudersdorf. She was connected with cjuar-
tette choirs in Park Street, Old South, and
Trinity and Emmanuel Churches, Boston.
She was also soprano soloist in the Handel
and Haydn Society and in the Cecilia Club.

She has travelled extensively in Europe, in
her own country, and in Canada, and is a great
lover of nature in its wildest grandeur. She
recalls with enthusiasm her experience at
Oberammergau, witnessing the Passion Play
in 1900, al.so the first performance of Wagner's
Nibelungenlied at Bayreuth, comlucted by
the composer himself, in 1876.

The Wotnan't' Chronicle (issued as a supple-
ment to the Cambridge Chronicle) in its issue
of December 3, 1S9.S, thus referred to Mrs.
Wellington's musical talents: "Music, an in-
heritance from her parents, has been one of
the chief inspirations of her life and a .solace
to her sorrows. She was brought up antl nurt-
ured in a musical atmosphere. Her mother's
voice was remarkably sweet, and her father
played several instruments, jiaying .special at-
tention to the organ and piano. She cannot
remember the time wlien she could not play
the piano. Before she was tall enough to reach
the keys, she stood on tiptoe to finger the melo-
dies she had heard. Besides her fondness for
classical music, from childhood martial music
always appealed to her, as she was of a patri-
otic nature." "

Since 1873 she has been actively interested
as director in the Cambridge Conservatory of
Music, on Lee Street, of which her father was
the founder and proprietor. She had the honor
of singing in one of the Montreal cathedrals,
and has appeared as accompanist with Camilla
Urso, the celebrated violinist. Many will re-
member her in operettas and concerts for chari-
table objects.

Mrs. Wellington considers it a pleasure and
a duty to engage in the work of philanthropy,
the objects of which are constantly knocking
at our doors and our hearts with their confi-
dential claims anil needs. No word of com-
plaint or of unkindness is ever heard from her
lips. In distributing for the flower mission
and visiting the sick and in other forms of
charitable work she is an enthusiast, as well as



in her musical career. Probably no woman in
Cambridge is more generally known and loved
than she. For several years she was on the
music faculty at ^\'ellesley College and the
New F^.iiglan(l Conservatory of Music.

Mrs. Wellington from her early youth has
been interested in and connected with clubs,
being recognized as a born organizer bj' her
schoolmates, as later by her maturer friends.
She has been entrusted with many responsible
positions, notably the presidency of the Daugh-
ters of Massachusetts, the Ladies' Aid Associ-
ation of the Soldiers' Home, the South Middle-
sex Unitarian Alliance Branches, the Wednes-
day Club, and New England Conservatory
Alunnii Association; the vice-presidency of the
Charity Club, Massachusetts Volunteer Aid
Association, Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, and Cantabrigia Club; has been secre-
tary and treasurer of the Roundabout Club;
director in the Cambridge Young Women's
Christian Association, the Woman's Club-house
Corporation, National Unitarian Women's Alli-
ance Board, East End Christian Union: and
one of the Parish Committee of the Austin
Street Unitarian Church in Cambridge. She
is a 'life member of other prominent organiza-
tions, including the New England Woman's
Club, Women's Educational and Industrial
I^nion, and American Unitarian Association.
She enjoys her membership in the Browning
Society, Emer.son Society, Shakespeare Club,
Boston Political Club, Suffrage League, Civil
Service Reform Association, and Political Eciual-
ity Club, and pays assessments in other clubs
to attest her interest in tlieir work even if ]3re-
ventetl from fre([uent attendance.

Widely esteemed in social as in puljlic life,
she is a woman of great executive ability, a
dignified and gracious ])resi(hng officer, a ready
speaker, and one who.se plans anil suggestions
always command respect. In patriotic work,
with which she is in deep sympathy, she was
associated with her husband, the late Colonel
Austin Clark Wellington, to whom she was
married November 29, 1887. A native of
Lexington, Mass., son of Jonas Clark and Har-
riet E. {Bosworth) Wellington, he had been
a resident of Cambridge and later of Boston,
having large coal business interests in both of

these cities. Colonel ^^'ellingt()n was popular
in social and military circles throughout the
vState. He was Past Commander of E. W.
Kinsley Post, No. 113, G. A. R., of Boston.
Returning from the Civil War as Adjutant of
the Thirty-eighth Massachusetts Regiment,
with which he had taken part in seven battles,
he was subsequently active in the State militia.
The First Regiment, of which he was conmiis-
sioned Colonel in Feliruary, 1882 — a position
that he held till his decease, September IS,
1888 — he brought to a high standard of ex-
cellence, as recognized throughout the country.
He was one of the trustees of the Soldiers'
Home in Chelsea. For two years in the seven-
ties he served as Representative in the Massa-
chusetts Legislature, and was on the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs. In 1871 he joined the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company.
He was a member of various societies and
clubs, literary and musical.

Mrs. Wellington has furnished a room in
Colonel W\'llington's honor at the Soldiers'
Home, Chelsea, known as the Austin C. Welling-
ton Memorial Room; also one in her own home
in Cambridge, containing numerous badges,
flags, pictures, _ books, and other relics and
souvenirs, many of them intrinsically valuable,
all interesting and highly prized for their asso-
ciations.



ARMENIA S. WHITE, first president,
/ \ now honorary president, of the New
X jL Hampshire Woman's Suffrage Associ-
ation, is well known for her many years
of efficient co-operation with her husband, the
late Nathaniel White, of Concord, N.H., in
works of philanthropy and reform. She was
born in Mendon, Mass., November 1, 1817,
daughter of ,fohn and Harriet (Smith) Aldrich.
Her direct paternal line of ancestry in America
begins with George' Aldrich, wlio, with his
wife Catherine, came from Derbyshire, England,
in 1631, and in 1603 was among the early settlers
of Mendon, Mass., removing thither from Brain-
tree. Jacob^ Aldrich, son of George,' marrietl
Huldah, daughter of Ferdinando Thayer, and
was the father of Moses,^ born in 1690.

Moses' Aldrich was a celebrated preacher of



the Society of Friends (or Quakers, as they
were often called) in Rhode Island. He trav-
elled as an approved minister, not only in the
colonies later forming the original States of
the American Union, but in the West Indies
and in England. He married in 1711 Hannah
White.

Judge Caleb^ Aldrich, son of Moses,' is men-
tioned in the History of Woonsocket, R.I., as
father of Naaman'^ and grandfather of John"
Aldrich, all of Smithfield, R.I. Naaman was
the father of John Aldrich, who was the father
of Mrs. White.

As shown by the following record, Mrs.
White's maternal ancestry includes three " May-
flower" Pilgrims, Edwanl Doty, Francis Cooke,
and Stephen Hopkins, also Mr. Hopkins's sec-
ond wife, Elizabeth, and their daughter Dam-
aris, who both came with him to Plymouth.
Mrs. White's mother, Harriet Smith Aldrich,
was born, as recorded in Smithfield, R.I., Feb-
ruary 21, 1795. She was a daughter of Samuel
Smith and his wife, Hope Doten. Her parents
were married at Plymouth, Mass., May 31,
1791, antl moved to Smithfield, R.I. Samuel
was a Revolutionary soldier, born in Smith-
field, R.I., enlisting in the American army at
the age of sixteen years. The Doty-Doten
Genealogy shows that Hope Doten, born in
Plymouth, Mass., in 1765, was daughter of
James and Elizabeth (Kempton) Doten, and
was descended from Edwartt Doty and his
wife. Faith Clark, through John' and Elizabeth
(Cooke) Doty, Isaac' and Martha (Faunce)
Doten, and Isaac' and Mary (Lanman) Doten,
Isaac' being father of James^ and grandfather
of Hope Doten, Mrs. White's maternal grand-
mother. Elizabeth, wife of John^ Doty (or
Doten), was the daughter of Jacob' Cooke (son
of Francis') and his wife Damaris, daughter of
Stephen Hopkins and his wife Elizabeth.

After the marriage of John Aldrich and Har-
riet Smith they moved from Smithfield, R.I.,
to Mendon, Mass. In 1830 Mr. and Mrs. John
Aldrich removed from Mendon, Mass., to Bos-
cawen, N.H. Their daughter Armenia was
educated in the public schools. On November
1, 1836, the nineteenth anniversary of her birth,
she was marrieil to Nathaniel White, then a
rising young business man of Concord, N.H.

Mr. White was born at Lancaster, N.H., Feb-
ruary 7, 1811, being a son of Samuel and Sarah
(Freeman) White and descendant of WilHam
White, an early settler of Essex County, Massa-
chusetts. For a number of years in his youth
he was employed in the Columbian Hotel,
Concord, N.H. He started in business for
himself in 1832, becoming a part owner
in the stage route between Concord and
Hanover, later buying the line between Concord
and Lowell. He was a young man of more
than ordinary ability, upright and honorable,
and using neither intoxicants nor tobacco in
any form. In 1837, in partnership with Cap-
tain William Walker, he established himself in
the express business, making tri-weekly trips
to Boston. Upon the opening of the Concord
Railroad in 1842 he became one of the original
members of the express company then organ-
ized to deliver goods throughout New Hamp-
shire and Canada. He died at his home in
Concord, October 2, 1880. In his forty-eight
years of business life he had acquired something
more than a competency, having become the
possessor of valuable realty in Chicago, hotel
property in New Hampshire, and stock in vari-
ous railroad corporations, banks, manufac-
tories, and other companies, in addition to his
interests in the express company and in Con-
cord real estate.

Mr. W^hite took a deep interest in the estab-
lishment of the New Hampshire A.sylum for
the Insane, the State Reform School, the Or-
phans' Home at Franklin, to which he gave a
generous endowment, and of the Home for the
Aged at Concord. Always a friend of the op-
pressed, he was an active member of the Anti-
slavery Society, a stanch helper also of the
cause of temperance and other unpopular
reform movements, among them that of woman
suffrage, his wife earnestly sympathizing and
working with him. He was, with his wife, one
of the original members of the Universal ist
Society in Concord and a constant attendant
and liberal supporter of that society.

An earnest supporter from the early days of
the movement in New England for the enfran-
chisement of women, Mrs. White has been active
in organizing suffrage meetings and very hos-
pitable in entertaining speakers, Lucy Stone,



Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Howe, and many others,
having been her guests from time to time.
She had in charge the New Hampshire tables
at the .several suffrage bazaars held in Boston,
and in various ways contributed to their suc-
cess. A writer in the book entitled " New
Hampshire Women" gives this summary of
Mrs. White's helpful activities: —

"The charitable and benevolent associations
of the State have ever been the object of her
fostering care. She was the first president of
the New Hampshire W. C. T. U., and has been
president of the New Hampshire Woman's
Suffrage Association since its organization.
Largely through her efforts, coupled with her
husband's, was secured the legislation enabling
the New Hampshire women to vote and hold
office in connection with school affairs. Mrs.
White is a member of the board of trustees of
the New Hampshire Centennial Home for the
Aged, of the Orphans' Home in Franklin, and
the Mercy Home in Manchester. She was ac-
tive in their establishment, and has been a
liberal supjwrter of each. The Universalist
church in Concord and at large, and manifold
charities, local and general, have ever com-
manded her earnest sympathy and generous aid."

Seven chiklren wei'e born to Mr. and Mrs.
White — namely, John A., Armenia E., Lizzie
H., Annie Frances (who died in 1865 at the age
of thirteen years), Nathaniel, Seldon F. (who
died in infancy), and Benjamin C. Harriet S.,
an adopted daughter, married Dr. D. P. Dear-
born, and is now a widow, living in Brattle-
boro, Vt.

Colonel John A. White, the eldest son, died
November 26, 1899. His first wife, Elizabeth
Mary Corning, died in 1873, leaving no children.
His .second wife was her cousin, Ella H. Corning.
Of this union there was one child, Arnold, born
in Concord, October 20, 1883.

Armenia E. White married Horatio Hobbs,
of Boston, Mass. He dieil in 1889, leaving two
children: Nathaniel White Hobbs, born No-
vember 1, 1873; and Annie White Hobbs, born
July 28, 1875. Mrs. Hobbs and her son and
daughter live with her mother, Mrs. White, in
Concord. Lizzie H. White married C. H.
Newhall, of Lynn, Mass. She died December
12, 1887.

EUNICE HALE WAITE COBB.— Eunice
Hale Waite Cobb was born in Kenne-
bunk, Me., January 27, 1803, the second
chiKl of Captain Hale Waite and his
wife, Elizabeth Stanwood. Her father had re-
moved to Kennebunk from old Ipswich, Mass.,
a .short time before she was born, and he re-
turned thither .soon after her birth, so that Ips-
wich is ever associated with her earliest child-
hood. Captain Waite died when Eunice was
in her fifth year, leaving a widowed mother and
four children, two of whom died at a very early
age.

After her father's death Eunice was cared for
by her maternal grand-parents until she was
ten years old, when her mother took for her
second husband Samuel Locke, of Hallowell,
Me., a man of liberal education, a school pre-
ceptor by profession. He had a strong, clear
mind, antl exerted an influence on the youthful
mind of his stepdaughter for which she was ever
grateful.

Thoroughly imbued with the Calvinistic doc-
trine by her grandparents, .she became at an
early age a prominent member of the Baptist
church of Hallowell, her fervid and effective
speech making her a religious power unusual
for one so young. Her conversion to L^niver-
salism was remarkable. Her stepfather was a
profound student of the Bible, and he could see
naught else in its pages, as he declared, but evi-
dences of the supreme and unchangeable love
of God, whose divine fatherhood was one with
his eternal being. F^unice was deeply ilis-
tre.«.sed by this condition of her stepfather's
mind, and finally prevailed upon her })astor,
Mr. Moses, to visit him and bring him to the



orthodox faith. Having brought them to-
gether, she sat back and listened with inten.se
interest and anxiety. Her account of this in-
terview, with the results that followed, given
in her diary, presents an epitome of religious
experience of the past century in a most inter-
esting manner.

The discussion that followed left Eunice in
dismay. After Mr. Locke had disposed of the
final attack in the consideration of the parable
of the rich man and Lazarus, which her minister
had brought forward with great confidence,
"he," we quote from Eunice's diary, "was
going to explain further, when the minister's
watch came out again, and he said he must go.
I asked him to wait a moment and I would
accompany him. I could not bear to be left
alone, just then, with my father. On our way
to the meeting-hou.se we were mostly silent.
Not a word was spoken in allusion to the late
discu.ssion. Arriving at the vestry, I took my
seat with my sisters, and then gave myself up
to thought. At this meeting, called for medi-
tation and prayer, I was to relate my experience
for the last time previous to my bajitism and
admission into the church. When I was called
upon to speak I arose, and tremblingly (for my
heart was painfully wrought upon) asked that
my baptism might be suspended (that was the
word used); and I further said that I made the
request after serious deliberation. An old lady,
sitting a few pews from' me, spoke up quickly
and excitedly, 'Aha! I guess you have been
taught in Master Locke's school since you were
with us last.' This remark, so impudently
uttered, gave me strength. 'No,' said I, firmly
and steadily, 'I have been taught in Christ's
school, and I will seek further instruction from
the same divine and blessefl source.'

"The minister said not a word: he only
bowed actiuiescence. He knew what I meant.
I will only add that I went home and sought the
instruction of which I had spoken. I .sought
it earnestly, humbly, and honestly; and, thank
God! very .soon my soul was basking in the
full glory of my heavenly Father's boundless
and answering love. I had become a Universa-
li.st."

She now declared she would marry a Uni-
versalist clergyman, and bring up twelve chil-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



137



dren in the fold of Israel. On May 8, 1821,
she enters in her diary: "Have been indulged
this evenmg with a privilege never before by
me enjoyed: have heard the universal love
of God publicly contended for by the Rev.
Sylvanus Cobb, a preacher of the Universalist
order. Indeed, my soul has been abundantly
feasted. How animating, how soul-cheering,
the subject of God's universal and impartial
benevolence ! To me it seems the most glorious
theme men or angels can dwell upon; and,
though I have never before heartl the doctrine
publicly proclaimed from the pulpit, yet I have
long enjoyed a firm belief therein, and have
enjoyed great satisfaction therefrom. It is
about a year and a half since I burst the har-
rowing bonds of the narrow creed of partialism
— man-made — and found light and joy in the
glorious field of God's universal and impartial
love, and I find I can gather daily of its whole-
some and delicious fruits a fresh supply; and,
should I be spareil to the common age of men,
and be permitted to range the same broad field
of glowing grace and partake of the heavenly
bounties, I surely shall find a spiritual food
sufficient for all my wants. In the good Father
I fear not to trust."

Eunice's heart beat in sympathy with her
soul. Sixteen months later she was united in
marriage to the preacher who had so inspired
that soul, the ceremony taking place at her
stepfather's house in Hallowell, Me., on Sep-
tember 10, 1822.

She became the mother of nine children, and
a more affectionate and faithful mother has not
lived. Their names and the dates of their birth
are as follows: Sylvanus, Jr., June 5, 1823;
Samuel Tucker, June 11, 1825; Eunice Hale,
April 15, 1827; Eben, January 17, 1829; George
Winslow, March 31, 1831: Sarah Waite, Decem-
ber 1, 1832; Cyrus and Darius (twins), August
6, 1834 ; James Arthur, December 22, 1842.

Immediately after the death of James Arthur,
at nine years of age, Mrs. Cobb, with a mother's
fondness, wrote his memoir, poi-traying traits
of character, remarkable for one so young,
which she desired to be known as an example
to others. Especially did she desire to publish
to the world an account of a remarkable vision
that he had, in which there appeared hovering



about him many angels, whose apf)earance and
words he described with heavenly serenity. He
repeated words spoken to him by the angels,
and presently he exclaimed, "Oh, this is Sally'"
His mother says, " My feelings here were inde-
scribable, for this was a dear sister of mine,
who died before I was married, and whom he
knew nothing about."

From this time to the day of his death, some
two months afterwartl, he longed to be with
the angels with whom he had so happily con-
versed. His life seemed transported. The
faith his mother had implanteil in his mind had
found its fruition in heavenly reality.

Mrs. Cobb's life was spent in work for the
public welfare. She was a frequent contribu-
tor to the religious press, and was a great fa-
vorite with the Sunday-schools, which she ad-
dressed with a heart filled with love for children
and a mind stored with all that interests them.

She was also equally interesting to the adult
listener. Every word told. Her utterance was
very distinct, her voice full, meloilious, and far-
reaching, not only into space, but into the
hearts and souls of her audience. She loved
humanity, and her eloquence was as the elo-
quence of a mother talking to a fondly listen-
ing family of children; in sliort, it was of the
kind with which Abraham Lincoln moved and
controlled his autlience. Without any mani-
festation of con.sciousness that she knew more
than her auditors, she kept them on a level
with her best, her highest, and her deepest
thought. She riveted attention the instant
her voice was heard. All felt as if they were
individually addressed, and each gave ear to
her words accordingly.

Mrs. Cobb, in her motherly way, once wrote
a letter to Queen Victoria, congratiilating her
on the birth of her third child, a letter so hap-
pily worded, .so sympathetic and sincere, that
it touched the royal heart, and was cordiaiiy
acknowledged.

Mrs. Eunice Hale Cobb's name as a writer
appears in the work devoted to the poets of
Maine, published a few years ago. As with all
else she did, her poetry was devoted to the good
of humanity.

She was a champion for the rights of woman
in the broadest sense. While she was not iden-



138



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



tified with the public advocates of woman's
rights, she counted among her warmest and
most devoted friends eminent leaders of this
exalted reform, and ever sympathetically in-
terchanged views on this topic. She attended,
by invitation, the first Woman's Rights Con-
vention held in this State — at Worcester. She
was greatly amused by the climax of an elo-
quent appeal of a somewhat aged colored
woman, who, in the midst of a fervid harangue,
cried out as only one of her race could, " Why,
sisters, if I am what I am without an ctlicashun,
what on arth would I be with one?"

Mrs. Cobb was widely known as a comforter
of the sick, the dying, and the bereaved. She
ever lived consciously with God, and those she
visited in the hour of trial and sorrow ever felt
through her liis i)resence. Her obituary poems
were the source of much solace: many were the
aching hearts that were soothed by her heaven-
inspired lines. There were those without num-
ber who might well ask, after a consoling visit
from her or a word from her pen, "0 death,
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy vic-
tory?" She walked with Jesus, and it would
seem at times as if she must have felt his hand
in hers.

Mrs. Cobb and her husband joined with
Professor C. P. Bronson in founding the Ladies'
Physiological Listitute of Boston, the leader
of all similar institutions in this country, Mr.
Cobb obtaining the charter for it. Professor
Bronson acted as president, by courtesy, the
first year. Mrs. Cobb then became the first
elected president, and served this her beloved
family, as she was wont to call it, until old age
compelled her to resign the learlership, still
by their earnest desire continuing her official
connection with them by acting as correspond-
ing secretary until a .short time before her
death.

Probably no past president is more fondly
enshrined in memory than is Mrs. Cobb in the
memory of the surviving older members of the
Ladies' Physiological Institute. The national
eminence of this pioneer institute reflects very
high honor upon the woman whose devoted
life was largely influential in imparting to it
so enduring a vitality.

The Masonic order hold her in honored mem-



ory. In 1834, while the excitement was raging
on account of the mysterious disappearance of
Morgan, who, having exposed the secrets of
Masonry, was suspected to have been made
away with by the Masons, an attempt was
made in the Massachusetts Legislature to sup-
press Free Masonry in this Commonwealth.
Mr. Cobb, who had consented to an election as
Representative, to .secure the pa.ssage of a bill
for the bridge between Charlestown and Maiden,
in which he met with his usual success, opposed
the attack on Free Ma.sonry with a power that
ensured its defeat, he himself being a Free
Mason.

The committee of the Maiden church of which
Mr. Cobb was pastor waited upon Mrs. Cobb,
and urgently requested her to use her influence,
which they knew to be strong with her husband,
to draw him from his position in his defence
of Free Masonry. "Gentlemen," she replied,
" I glory in my husband's defence of Free Ma-
sonry, and not one word will I utter to with-
draw him from it." "But, Mrs. Cobb," re-
.sponded one of the committee, "yours and
your children's bread and butter may depend
upon it." "Gentlemen," was the answer,
"when it comes to that, I will go with my
children into the woods and feed on nuts and
acorns before I s{)eak to him as you desire."

An old Mason informed Mrs. Cobb several
years afterward that her name was inscribed
on the Ma.sonic record in such a manner as
virtually to make her an honorary member of
the order.

Mrs. Cobb was a prominent and active mem-
ber of the order of Rechabites, a temperance
association organized b}' women. In fact,
wherever the opportunity was offered her to
aid mankind through her woman's influence,
there she was found performing her duty.

Fjve of her family served in the Civil War —
four sons, Sylvanus, Jr., George Winslow, and
Cyrus and Darius, and Lafayette Culver, hus-
band of her daughter, Eunice Hale. Sylvanus,
Jr., conunanded at Fort Kittery, Me., and the
others served in Virginia and North Carolina,
George's name now standing on record at
Washington for signal bravery in leading the
charge as First Sergeant from "Fort Hell" to
"Fort Damnation," as the Confederates named

them. Of the sons, Cyrus and Darius first en-
listed; and the mother displayed her Spartan
spirit from this time throughout the war. She
was present as a leader in the meetings of
mothers and sisters anil others, held so often
in Boston for prayer for the loved volunteers
fighting at the front. Her disinterested patri-
otism was the more marked inasmuch as the
twins were the only sons left her at home, the
others being married. She was a welcome vis-
itor to Readville Camp, always responding to
the request of the twins' comrades to address
them, in which the father joined when he visited
the camp with her. On account of her fervor
at the prayer meetings it was anticipated that
there would be a somewhat dramatic scene
when the Forty-fourth Regiment should be
received by their friends on Boston Common
on their return, but the anticipatetl scene was
not enacted. Mother and sons met with marked
calmness. The same calmness that had at-
tended the departure for possible death in
battle received the safe return.

Fortitude was a prime virtue. It attended
her through life, and appeared with a kind of
solemn grandeur on the approach of death.
Having had two strokes of paralysis, she
awaited the third stroke with tran([uillity. She
calmly arranged with her twin sons for her
funeral, going into all details with them as if
it were an ordinary, every-day matter. She
recjuested them to sing at her grave, which they
promised to do if they were able. They then
knelt at her feet, and she placed her hands
upon their heads and blessed them. They feel
those hands upon their bowed heails to this
day, and listen to the dying mother's blessing
uttered in that same firm, fervid tone which
had so often been an inspiration and a comfort.

Her last hours were spent in a pleasant
chamber, that overlooked Mystic River and
Bunker Hill Monument. On a beautiful morn-
ing. May 2, 1880, while the Sabbath bells were
ringing, she realized that the last summons had
come. She asked her grandson, Albert Wins-
low, who was alone with her, to help her to a
large arm-chair awaiting her in the chamber.
Her mother and grandmother had died in this
chair, and she had always desired to die in it.

When she was in the chair, she made a sign



for her grandson to take her hand. "Help qie
over, don't hold me back," she said with tran-
quil happiness. Her son George Winslow and
his wife and daughter appeared, having been
warned by Albert. Heaving struggles for
breath ensued. "Excuse me for making this
noise," she gasped. "I cannot help it." Thus
did she show to the last that tender regard for
the feelings of others which had ever charac-
terized her — an ever-attendant virtue.

The funeral services were held in the l^niver-
salist church at East Boston, and were attended
by the Ladies' Physiological Institute in a
body. According to her dying request, the
funeral sermon was delivered by the Rev. Dr.
A. St. John Chambrc, whom she loved as a
son.

A very touching, memorable incident now
occurred. A lovely little babe, seven months
oki, the infant daughter of Darius and Laura,
died the same day her grandmother died, so
that those who parted with her could but be-
hold her, in their faith's vision, received into
the grandmother's arms in greeting, she never
having seen the child in this life. Her little
casket was placed beside the casket of the
grandmother, antl as the members of the In-
stitute passed by, to look for the last time upon
the features of their tenderljj: remembered presi-
dent, their eyes were unexpectedly greeted by
the sight of this little babe, sweetly sleeping its
last sleep by the side of its grandmother. Many
were the responsive tears from those who wit-
nessed this scene. It seemed as if enacted by
Heaven itself, to impress upon our hearts the
memory of that blessed mother in Israel, who
so loved the little children and ever made them
so happy.

When the little child was drawing her last
breath, her eyes were fixed upward with a mar-
vellously heaven-inspired gaze, ere their earthly
lids were forever closed, ^^'hat she there saw
only Heaven knows. In their souls' vision the
parents have always seen that sainted grand-
mother, whom the Sabbath morning bells had
ushered into heaven, awaiting, while the even-
ing bells of the same holy Sabbath were usher-
ing in her dear grandchild.

At the grave the avin sons, Cyrus and Darius,

ALMEDA HALL COBB.- The life of

/\ Almeda Hall Cobb exemplifies Mary

X \. A. Livermore's saying that " fighting

and war have been the main business

of the world, in which women take no part,

save to endvire and suffer."

Born August 27, 1S34, in the quaint, beauti-
ful town of Marshfield, on Massachusetts Bay,
she was the daughter of William and Sarah
(Kent) Hall. Her lineage was partly from
the "Mayflower's" first company, Standish,
White, and Brewster stock being among the
blend in the ancestry of her mother, Sarah
Kent. Her father, William Hall, of a line of
South Shore ship-builders, was a man sterling
in character.

Alnieda's nature was, during her girlhood,
sprightly and winsome to a degree that matte
her presence a perpetual delight. Brimful of
music, it was her singing in the choir of the
Rev. vSylvanus Cobb's church that stirred his
son, George Winslow Col)b, to woo and win
Almeda Hall for his wife. There was appro-
priateness in the mating, for her husband's
line of ancestry was direct from Elder Henry
Cobb, of Plvmouth and Barnstable, an immi-
grant of 1629.

To her wedded life Almeda brouglit all the
innate Pilgrim reverence for holy marriage
and for divinity, developing more and more
with the sacred cares of maternity. The
diary of her wifehood, dating from her wedding



tlay, May 1, 1856, is like a sacred poem, a latter-
day song of Ruth, in its spirit and diction.
Brought immediately, in the household and
church of her husbantl's parents, Sylvanus and
Eunice Cobb, into contact with noble men and
women identified with the great temperance
and anti-slavery reforms, her soul was quick-
ened with desire to serve humankind as they
were serving it. Yet her wifely and motherly
devotion taxed her time, and only by the pages
of her diary is the inmost secret of her real
character revealed.

Three years after her marriage she writes:
" How swiftly the time glides by, employed as
I am at present with my two little ones and
other domestic cares! for the happiest home
has these cares if well conducted.- Indeed,
I can no more be happy if these little duties
are neglected. I confess they sometimes press
heavily upon me, and I feel that I would fain
fly off from them a while and refresh my weary
spirit by communion Avith the gifted spirits
whose works lie thick around me; for, simple
though our home is in its outward adornings,
we have plenty of good books here. But I
look forward to the time when these little ones
will not require quite so close attention from
me. There is so much I want to do, for myself,
my family, and for everybody, all over this
great and good world."

And again, later: "Thoughts I hav.e that
thrill my soul and make me better each hour
I live, thoughts born of deep life experiences
made blessed teachers by trust in God, thoughts
that might shed light on the pathway of many
a weary, sin-sick pilgrim ; and yet nmst I keep
them, for my time, if it cometh ever, is not
yet come. Yet, if it be best so, then I know
the Father will j'et unseal tliese mute lips and
give f)ower to this dumb tongue. And, if it
be better so, let me be yet as now. Only
teach me thy will, my Father, and I am
content. Let my work be what and where
it may: if I may only add to thy truth and
power in the earth, I will be happy in doing it,
and count myself, even though my sphere
be limited, one of thy meek and lowly apostles,
ever striving to lead others in the ' pleasant
paths,' if I can in no other way, by a pure and
spotless life.

"But I humbly, earnestly pray for a wider
sphere of usefuhiess. Darkness and error pre-
vail on every hand. I would fain have power
to clear away some of these clouds. And shall
I pray in \ain? We have the promise — if we
seek, we shall find."

These words are the end of this written rec-
ord of a woman's love and trust; for in this
"great and good world" there were certain
men at the South who about that time trained
their cannon on the starred and striped flag
of the government which " would not suffi-
ciently Jet them eat their bread in the sweat
of other men's faces"; and so woman's love and
trust, and joy of peaceful ministry everywhere,
were whelmed in the crash and mauling antl
woe of a mighty Civil War — a war which taught
the braggart tyrant fcjrces of the world that
the most terrible foemen on earth are the
"woman-hearted" men who love their fair,
free homes and simple fireside joys, but who
will fight when fight they nuist, or see the
truth crushed down forever.

Those who know the life histoiy of Almeda
Hall Cobb throughout that woeful season, know
of her ceaseless ministries, her home toil for the
hospitals and for (he wounded brought back
from the front; know of the birth of another
daughter, replacing the baby girl whom death
had taken; know of her continuous thought and
labor for the cause of Union and liberty. Her
husband's brothers had volunteeretl for the
front; but him whom she loved so devotedly
the conscription had not touched, ami she was
loath to let him go. Yet the time came when,
after Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,
Grant, the great chieftain whom the nation
trusted, mighty in war yet with latent peace-
yearnings in his heart, needed volunteers to re-
pair the losses of his terrible cami&gt;aign toward
Richmond. Then Almeda yielded her final sac-
rifice, as her husband, George Winslow Cobb,
of the Sixty-first Regiment, Massachusetts Vol-
unteers, set forth to join in the death-grapple
around Petersburg and Richmond. While the
bulletins brought news tlay by clay of his
regiment's engagment in the thick of the
fight, his wife, at home with Albert and Mar-
garet, their little boy and girl, encountered
her daily trials, supporting her little ones,



shielding and guarding them with anxious
care against encompassing, un'speakable social
demoralizations, which are always part of the
price of war. imd which brave Mary Liver-
more has published anil proclaimed with un-
wavering courage, as she arraigns the war-
policies of nations.

Once at home by furlough with endorsement
for bravery in battle, greeting his now invalid
wife and the children, then again to the front,
Almeda's husband took her heart with him,
in yearning that wore her vital force away.
A few months after Grant's magic words,
"Let us'have peace," had dissolved and sent
home a host of a million men at arms, Almeda
Hall Cobb, representative of woman-martyrs
as the sands of the sea for nundjer, yielded
her earth-life, worn and finished by war, and
her body of this mortality was laid at rest in
Woodlawn, Septeml)er 20, 1865.

In many young people to whom "grand-
mother's" face and memory are only a far-
away tradition her traits of righteousness now
live on, blessed by peace. In so far as her
soul's desire to spread the light of truth can
be fulfilled in trust by a son who lives after her,
it shall be fulfilled, and thus her prayers be
answered; while for herself and her kind in
the mysterious life beyond tleath, there is a
Scripture —

" \Miat are these which are arrayed in white
robes? and whence came they?

"And I said unto him. Sir, thou knowest.
And he said to me. These are they which have
come up out of great tribulation."



MARY CAFFREY L()W^ CARVER
was born at Waterville, Kennebec
County, Me., March 22, 1850, being
the .second daughter of Ira Hobbs
Low and Ellen Mandana Caffrey Low. Her
paternal grandparents were Ivory and Fanny
(Colcord) Low, of Fairfield, Me., Ivory being
the son of Obadiah Low, a native of Sanford,
Me. Her mother was a grand-daughter of John
Pullen, who came from Attleboro, Mass., and
settled in Winthrop, Me., where he married
Amy Bishop, daughter of Squier Bishop and
his wife, Patience Titus Bishop. John Pullen

and Squier Bishop, Jr., a brother of Amy (Mrs.
Pullen), enlisted in the Continental army and
served in the Revolutionary War.

Mrs. Carver, after receiving her education in
the public schools (if Waterville, took a three
years' course at Coliurn (then Waterville)
Classical Institute, under the well-known edu-
cator, Dr. James H. Hanson. She subsequently
spent one year there as teacher of Greek and
Latin, being special assistant to Dr. Hanson
in his department, and then entered Colby Uni-
versity for a full collegiate course. She was
graduated from that institution with the high-
est honors in the class of 1875, being one of the
first women in a New England college to take
the full prescribed classical, mathematical, and
scientific course. After graduation she taught
in different high schools and academies of the
State. The marriage of Mary Caffrey Low and
Leonard Dwight Carver took place in 1877.
Two children have been born of their union,
namely: Ruby Carver, now a student at Colby
College; and Dwight Carver, who died in 1889.

Since leaving college Mrs. Carver has been
active in religious and intellectual work. She
is a member of Colby Chapter, Phi Beta Kappa;
of Koussinoc Chapter, Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution; of the Unity Club of Augusta;
and a life member of the American L^nitarian
Association. She has written much in the form
of essays, lectures, and papers for special occa-
sions, the most notable being her lectures on
the "Beauty of the Psalms" and on the "Liter-
ature of the Old Testament," which she has
read to appreciative audiences in several States.
Mrs. Carver is now fully occupied in cata-
loguing and in special work in the Maine
State Library.



FANNY CLIFFORD BROWN, in the
closing years of the nineteenth century
one of the best known, most active,
and influential club women and phi-
lanthropists of Portland, Me., died in California,
December 20, 1900. She was born at New-
field, Me., May 11, 1834, daughter of the Hon.
Nathan Clifford and his wife Hannah, daughter
of James Ayer.

Nathan Clifford was born in 1803 in Rum-



ney, N.H. Son of Deacon Nathan, Sr., and
Lydia (Simpson) Clifford, he was — as shown
in Dow's History of Hampton, N.H. — a lineal
descendant in the sixtli generation of "George
Clifford, tlescended from tlie ancient ami noble
family of Clifford in England" (dating back
seven hundred years and more), who came from
Nottinghamshire, I'^ngland, to Boston in 1644,
and later removed to Hampton, N.H. Nathan
Clifforil as a young lawyer settled in York
County, Maine. He was Attorney-General of
the State, 1834-38; in Congress, December,
1839, to March, 1843; in ]84fi he was Attorney-
General of the United States in the cabinet of
President Polk; in 1848 was sent as Envoy
E.xtraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
to Mexico; in 1858 was appointed by President
Buchanan Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court; and in 1877 served as
President of the Electoral Commission. He
died in 1881.

Fanny Clifford married at the age of seven-
teen years the late Philip Henry Brown, of
Portland, Me., a manufacturer and banker
and a man of much culture. Eight children
were born of this union. The father died
October 25, 1893. The surviving children are:
Philip Greeley Brown: Nathan Clifford Brown,
Mrs. Linzee Prescott, Boston: Mrs. F. D. True;
of Portland; and Helen Clifford Brown.

Of a strongly religious temperament, Mrs.
Brown early became a member of the High
Street Congregational Churcli, and was always
prominent in its activities. She also felt
much interest in charitable work, and took
such part in it as her home duties permitted
throughout her early married life. It was not,
however, until her chiklren had grown to
maturity that she became the leader in local
philanthropic work which she continued to be
to the end of her life. She was also in her
later years an enthusiastic club woman, was
president of several organizations and a mem-
ber of many others. She had a judicial mind,
inherited, no doubt, from her father, and,
having made a careful study of parliamentary
law, was a tactful and popular presiding offi-
cer. Some of the clubs and charities of which
she was a member are as follows: the \'olun-
teer Aid Society, of which she was president,

the society having been fornietl during the
Spanish War; the Invalids' Home; the Women's
Council; the Crockett Club; the Women's Lit-
erary Tnion; the Clifford Club, which was
named by the other members in honor of Mrs.
Brown's father^ the Portland Fraternity; the
Civic Club; the Beecher Club; the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; ami the
Young Women's Christian Association. She
was president of several of these clubs, and
refused this office for many of the others.

She was deeply interested in the Diet Mis-
sion. She was vice-president of an organiza-
tion recently formed for establishing a mater-
nity hospital at Portland. But her favorite
charity was undoubtedly the Temporary Home
for Women anil Children, of which she was
one of the founders in 1882 and always a stead-
fast friend. She was the ardent champion of
the home throughout a long period during
which it was frowned upon by the community
as an ill-advised institution — a period happily
long past. It is not too much to say that
most of the present popularity of the home
is due to her. She was chosen vice-president
of the home in 1885, and retained the office as
long as she lived, being for many years, on
account of the invalidism of the titular presi-
dent, practically president.

Mrs. Brown's death was a pathetic sacrifice
and the direct result of her maternal devotion.
In December, 1900, she learned by telegraph
that her son John (twenty-seven years of age),
who had served three years with distinction
in the United States army, had left the Phil-
ippines and had reached San Francisco, where
he lay very ill, in a military hospital, of disease
contracted in service. She at once started
with a daughter for the Pacific coast. A cold
caught on the train developed into pneu-
monia. Her nervous system having been sub-
jected to a severe strain throughout the jour-
ney and her vitality being nmch loweretl by
anxiety, her illness soon became alarming,
and twelve days after her arrival in San Fran-
cisco and after she had seen and comforted
her son, himself doomed to a speedy death,
she died, December 20, 1900.

The announcement in Portland of her death
was followed by a remarkable manifestation of



sorrow in the newspapers, and in the clubs of
which she was a member, as well as in her family
and among her every-flay friends. A wide-
spread desire was expressed for a suitable
memorial of her beneficent life; and, under
the leadership of the club women of Portland,
action was at once taken for its fulfilment.
Nowhere, it was felt, could a more fitting place
be found than at the Temporary Home, Mrs.
Brown's favorite charity; accordingly, within
a few months a nursery was erected there, to
bear her name. On one of its walls is fixed a
tablet with the inscription : —

IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF
FANNY CLIFFORD BROWN.



S AGNES PARKER, Past National Chap-
lain of the Woman's Relief Corps, was
, born in New London, N.H., January 12,
1841, daughter of Martin and Anna

and some years later removed to New London,
N.H. Moses,^ born in 1765, married in 1790
Dolly (or Dorothy) Perley, and resided in New
London, N.H., where his son Mo.ses, Jr.," above
nanietl, was born in 1792. Moses Adams, Jr.,
and Betsy Stinson were married in Decem-
ber, 1819. They had four daughters. Anna,



144



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



the eldest, married in March, 1840, Martin
Packard.

Mr. and Mrs. Martin Packard removed from
New London, N.H., to North Bridgewater
(now Brockton), Mass., in 1844. Their daugh-
ter Agnes was then three years old. She was
educated in the public schools and at Hunt's
Academy. On January 23, 1859, she was
married to John B. Parker, of North Bridge-
water, who was later a veteran of the Civil
War.

Mrs. Parker became identified with the Uni-
versalist church forty-five years ago, and is one
of its most active members. The Ladies' Aid
Society connected with the church elected her
president several years in succession, and she
has held other important positions associated
with the work of this church.

When the Hosjjital Aid Society was formed
in Brockton, she was elected one of the Direc-
tors, and the next year was chosen President.
She assisted in founiling the Woman's Educa-
tional and Industrial L'nion of Brockton, and has
served continuously in office, was its President
six years, and has been active in raising funds
for its benefit. This union has had a large
membership, and has been supported by all
the churches in the city.

Mrs. Parker is naturally patriotic; and when,
early in 1873, a Grand Army Sewing Society
was formed, to' assist Post No. 13, of Brockton,
she joined its membership roll and was chosen
secretary. Elected its first President when the
society became a branch of the Department
of Massachusetts Woman's Relief Corps in
October, 1879, she was subsequently re-elected
for three successive years.

The corps, which is one of the largest and
most efficient in the State, is auxiliary to
Fletcher Webster Post, No. 13, G. A. R., and
is No. 7 on the roster of the Department W.
R. C. The members appreciate Mrs. Parker's
long-continued and faithful service in the
cause.

At the annual State convention in Boston
in 1880 " the various corps presidents gave
good accounts of their corps, that of Mrs. S.
Agnes Parker, of Fletcher Webster Corps, of
Brockton, being specially interesting."

Mrs. Parker served on important committees



that year, and at the convention in 1881 was
elected Department Treasurer. She was De-
partment Inspector in 1882, and also served
as a member of the Committee on Ritual,
Rules, and Regulations. The following year
she was appointed chairman of this committee,
and was elected to the office of Department
Junior ^'ice-President. In 1884 she was chosen
Department Senior \'ice-President, and in
1885 re-elected. She presided over the annual
convention in Boston in 1886, the Department
President, Mrs. Goodale, being detained at
home by illne.ss. This cf)nvention elected
Mrs. Parker President for the ensuing year,
and at its close she presented a report, in which
the following summary of the work under her
charge is given: —

" I have been on duty at headejuarters every
week but two. I have issued seven general
orders. In my first and seconil general orders I
appointed a staff of aides to assist the depart-
ment officers in their work and be of service to
those corps in remote parts of the State where
they needed assistance or instruction. . . .

" My duties as Department President have
occupied the greater part of my time. I have
travelled in official capacity in the State of
Massachusetts four thousand and seventy-one
miles, have made forty-one visits to corps,
and have been cordially received by the mem-
bers. I attended the National Convention at
San Francisco, receiving many courtesies on
this trip from Department Commander John D.
Billings and other officials of the Grand Army
of the Republic. I have accepted many invi-
tations to anniversaries and inspections, have
instituted one corps, installed the officers of six
corps, and have paid other official visits too
numerous to mention.

" We have expended in relief the past year
three thousand nine hundred and three dollars
and forty-seven cents. This sum does not in-
clude the entire amount contributed, as nnich
has been given in the way of clothing and other
articles. The Soliliers' Home has received
six hundred and fifty-.seven dollars and twenty-
eight cents."

Mrs. Parker was unanimously ro-electeil
Department President at the convention in
Boston in 1887. In her annual address in



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



145



1888 she referred to the grcnvth tun I work of
the order in Massachusetts; —

"January, 1887, we had seventy-seven corps
with a membership of five thousand two hun-
dred and fifty-seven. To-(hiy we number one
hunih'ed corps with a membership of over six
thousand seven hundred. Amcjunt expended in
rehef the past year, five thousand six hundred
and twenty-four dohars and .orty cents, and
turned over to posts, three thousand two hmi-
dred and fifty-eight doHars ami thirty-four
cents. This amount does not cover the amount
of all clothing and food given, as in many cases
the value is not estimated. The amount re-
ported as given the Soldiers' Home the past
year is six thousand seven hundred and ninety-
one dollars and eighty cents, which does not in-
ckule the total figures.

" My duties as De]iartment President have
occupied nearly all my time. I have issued
seven general orders and two circular letters,
have visited headquarters ninety times, have
travelled in official capacity in this State five
thousand eight hundred and forty-four miles,
visiting thirty-eight tlifi'erent corps. ... I have
had the pleasure of installing the officers of
seven corps, have instituted two corps, and as-
sisted at the institution of others. I had the
honor of attending the National Convention
held at St. Louis. Number of official visits
made during the year is two hundred antl
seven." A reception was tendered Mrs.
Parker in Boston, upon her return from St.
Louis, by the delegates who representetl Mas-
sachusetts at the Fourth National Conven-
tion. Fletcher Webster Post and Corps, of
Brockton, also gave her a reception in that
city.

Mrs. Parker gained the love of her associates
and won the regard of the Grand Ai-my of the
Republic during the two years of her adminis-
tration. Upon retiring from the chair she
was appointed and installed Department Coun-
sellor and reappointed the following year.

At the convention of 1890 Mrs. Parker was
appointed a member of the Committee on
Dej)artment Rooms at the Soldiers' Home
and at every subsetiuent convention she has
been reappointed. She is also a member oi
other important committees. At the Nationa



Convention in Pittsburg, Pa., September, 1894,
she was unanimously elected National Chaplain.

Mrs. Parker's husband, Mr. John B. Parker,
of Brockton, was born in Boxford, Mass., a
son of Aaron L. and Priscilla (Buzzell) Parker.
He served in the Civil War in Company F,
Fifty-eighth Massachusetts Volunteers, was
wounded at Cold Harbor, and honorably dis-
charged for disability soon after the surrender
of General Lee. He has been Quartermaster
of Fletcher Webster Post, of Brockton, the past
twenty years.

Three of the seven children born to Mr. and
Mrs. Parker dieil in infancy. Of the four
others the following is a brief record : Katie Flor-
ence, born March 23, 1862, is the wife of Robert
Davis, of North Easton, and mother of four
children — Arthur Horace, Fred Carleton, Helen
Parker, and Agnes Elena; Fred ChantUer, born
August 31, 1866, married in February, 1901,
M. Elizabeth Crummitt, and died Januarv
12, 1904 ; Annie Etlith, born December 28,
1875, married Harry L. Thompson, and has
one child, F]rrol Mitchell; Frank Adams Parker
was born June 30, 1884.



ALICE SPENCER GEDDES.— One day

/\ in the early fall of 1898 a young
X A. woman, a Freshman in Radcliffe Col-
lege, received a letter asking her to
call upon the editor of the largest and most
influential paper in the city in which she lived.
"I have noticed with approval," said the edi-
tor, " the reports of the Cambridge Art Circle
affairs, which you as clerk have sent in. Will
you take charge of a woman's department in
my paper?"

"What do you want in it? How shall I
start about it? Do you think I can do it?"
were some of the questions asked by the be-
wilflered girl.

"I am too busy to answer questions. Will
you furnish matter for eight columns of the
Cambridge Chronicle a week from to-day?"

"Yes, sir, I will," came the prompt reply.

Thus it was that Miss Geddes was jjrecipi-
tately plunged into the field of journalism.

She often jests now about the feeling of utter
helplessness which overwhelmed her as she left



146



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



that editor's office, hut she knows that it was
this very throwing of herself on her own re-
sources that started her on her successful career.
A week from that day the Woman'n Chronicle,
supplement to the Cambridge Chronicle, ap-
peared, containing an editorial by the young
editor, setting forth the policy of the paper,
which was not to be concerned with the senti-
mental and useless matter usually crowding the
so-called woman's pages of our large news-
papers, but rather was to be devoted to educa-
tional, philanthropic, and social activities of
Cambriclge women. This first issue containefl
a resume of all of these lines of work, illustrated
with photographs of prominent women inter-
ested in them.

From that time, save during the months of
July antl August of each year, the Worn an' ft
Chronicle as long as she edited it kept to the
high ideals of the first issue, largely increased
the circulation of the paper, and came to be
recognized as the official organ of women's
societies in Cambridge. All this Miss Geddes
accomplished entirely unaided. She collected
the matter, wrote the articles, and read the
proof for each issue, and at the same time
carried on the regular course at Radcliffe, and
held the positions of clerk of th(&gt; Cambridge
Art Circle and the Cantabrigia Club. Such
were the beginnings of the career of a young
woman who is now widely known, not only
as an active worker in women's clubs and as
a journalist, l)ut as a lecturer and class leader
in all branches of English literature.

Alice S})encer Ceddes was born in Athol,
Mass., Noveml)er 13, 1876, and was named for
her paternal grandmother, with whom she
spent her early years. In 187S the family
moved to Cambridge; and in the following
year her parents, William E. and Ella M.
Ceddes, went to England to establish business
there. As thej' intended to be absent but a
.short time, the daughter was left in her grand-
mother's charge. But, where success is, there
is contentment; and Mr. and Mrs. Geddes took
up their permanent residence in London. Ever
since her babyhood, then, the daughter has
lived in Cambridge in the winter and in Lon-
don in the summer.

Miss Geddes is a graduate of Chauncy Hall



School, Boston, which she entered at the age
of eight, and of Radcliffe College, class of LS99.
After leaving Radcliffe, she studied at Newn-
ham College. As a result of her special fond-
ness for English literature and of her familiarity
with the homes antl haunts of literary men and
women abroad, she was led to enter upon the
field of work which has brought her fame.

In October, 1901, a large audience listened
to a "Recital of Literary Romances" by Miss
Geddes. Clearly and distinctly, without af-
fectation, she read the stories .she had written
of the love episodes in the liA'es of Swift and
his Stella, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Brown-
ing, and Carlyle and Jane W^elsh. Her hearers,
among them being many literary critics, mar-
velled at the purity and beauty of these sketches,
as well as at their keen insight and penetration
into character.

The next morning the leading Boston papers
announced the appearance of a new star in the
literary firmament, and letters congratulatory
were followed by letters of inquiry as to terms
for lecture and class work. Thus, at the early
age of twenty-five. Miss Geddes became much
in demand to give lectures and recitals and
lead classes in eighteenth century and Victorian
literature.

The secret of her popularity lies in the new-
ness of her methods; for in her analysis of a
great work of literature she gives merely sta-
tistics enough to identify the period, and avoids
repeating well-known truisms and general state-
ments. She goes below the outer shell, and
unearths the inner meaning of the work, the
causes which produced it, and the effect of its
existence. She is now preparing a course of
ten lectures on "The Novel and Life," which
will follow the parallel development of civiliza-
tion and the English novel.

In spite of the amount of brain work which
so many demands call from her, she has not
lost her girlishness, and is much sought after
at the gatherings of young people in Cam-
bridge. She is much interested in club work,
being a member of the Cambridge Art Circle,
the ("antal)rigia" Club, the Woman's Charity
Club, the Metaphysical Club, the Actors' Church
Alliance, the New England Woman's Press As-
sociation, and the Ruskin Club.

Her personality is chanuing, and her natural-
ness of manner makes her a pleasing picture
on the lecture platform and an ins])iring leailer
in class work.

In March, 1903, she took the most ambitious
step of all. She purchasetl a well-known Cam-
bridge newspaper, The Cambridge Prefts, and
announced in the first number that it would be
devoted to tlie interests of Cambritlge, and that
it would be owned, edited, and conducted en-
tirely by women. This innovation was a wel-
come one, and the excellent sheet is a source of
[jride to the whole city. There is not a weak
point about it. Miss Geddes is a born journa-
list, and her editorials are fine samples of lit-
erarv style and fearless utterance.



EFFIE MARION FRANCES NEED-
HAM HARTWELL.— In every city
and town of New England, safe to .say,
at the present time women are to be
found (juietly and earnestly striving to estab-
lish better social conditions, conforming to
higher ideals. Fitchburg, Ma.ss., is no ex-
ception to this, and a leader among its women
workers is Mrs. Hartwell, whose name in full
appears at the head of this article.

Her father, Colonel Daniel Needham, was
born in Salem, Ma.ss., of good Quaker stock,
an energetic, active nature, ]&gt;ositive in opinion,
and always taking his full share of the business
of the State and local affairs. He married Miss
Caroline Augusta Hall, of Boston, a woman of
charmingly attractive personal character.
Their fourth child, Effie Marion Frances, was
born in Croton, Mass., January 9, ]&lt;S52. The
family removed to Queechee, Yt., in 1855, living
there among the mountains until Effie was
twelve years of age, when they returned to
their old home town, (troton was one of the
academy towns of New England, which, be-
fore the establishment by law of high schools
in all tlie larger towns, were centres of learning
and refinement. For a century or more the
Lawrence Academy in Groton held high rank
in its cla,ss, and here Miss Needham ac(iuired
a soliil groimding in ed\ication, which was sup-
plemented by a year of study at the Prospect
Hill School in Greenfield, Mass., and a season



at the Misses Gilman's finishing school in Boston.
From 1809 to 1877 she resided in Boston, and
on October 23 of this latter year she was mar-
ried to Harris Cowdrey Hartwell. Her home
has since been in Fitchburg. Two sons were
born to Mr. and Mrs. Hartwell, namely: Nor-
cross Needham Hartwell, December 15, 1880;
and Harold Hall Hartwell, May 6, 1891.

Mr. Hartwell was a native of Groton and an
alumnus of Lawrence Academy. He was grad-
uated at Harvard College in 1869. He studied
law in Fitchburg, and was admitted to the bar
in 1873. He was Repre.sentative from Fitch-
burg in the Massachu.setts Legislature in 1883,
1884, 1885, and a State Senator in 1887, 1888,
1889, being president of the Senate in 1889.
His untimely death in 1891 cut short a career
of unusual promise. In Mr. Hartwell's public
and official life his wife was his strong supporter
and efficient help, and his manly qualities and
public ])osition undoubtedly quickened her
natural executive ability and strong desire to
serve others. She has l)een itlentified with
many of the best institutions of her city. She
was the first president of the Fitchburg Woman's
Club, continuing in office for six consecutive
years; and during that time, under her vigorous
administrative ability, the club took rank
among the highest of the State in sohd educa-
tive \york, healthy growth, and steadily in-
creasing value to its members, becoming one
of the acknowledged forces of the city. Mrs.
Hartwell was a director of the Massachusetts
State Federation of Women's Clubs, and has
served on several of its committees. She is the
vice-president of the Old Lailies' Home Cor-
poration, the j)resident of its Ladies' Benevo-
lent Society, and one of the stanchest sup-
porters and workers for this useful institution,
which has, from a small but earnest beginning,
grown to own its large ami conunodious brick
home, housing and providing for fifteen or
twenty inmates.

Taking an interest in everything teniling to
the advancement of woman, she is a stanch
advocate of suffrage for her sex on an equality
with male suffrage. During the existence of
the Women's Educational and Industrial Union
in Fitchburg, Mrs. Hartwell was a personal
worker, untiring in her efforts to keep it to



148

the jmrpose indicated by its name. She is a
director in the Benevolent Union (the Asso-
ciated Charities organization in Fitchburg),
and is a most active working member of the
Baldwinsville Hospital Cottage Auxiliary, a
society formed to aid the partially State-sup-
ported hospital for epileptic children at Bald-
winsville, Mass. She is also a warm frieml and
helper to the Children's Home, another of the
charitable and practically helpful institutions
of her city.

Mrs. Hartwell has always been an earnest
Unitarian in her religious belief and affiliation,
and has been among the foremost in the First
Parish Church of Fitchburg in all its activities,
giving unstintedly of her time and means to
promote its best welfare, and hlling for more
or less extended time the various church
appointments usually enjoyed by women.

In sinnming up, we may .say that conspicu-
ous executive ability, indomitable energy and
persistenc)^ a clear and broad vision, great
tact, loyalty to friends and to purpose, and
painstaking fidelity to any matter in hand are
Mrs. Hartwell 's characteristics, anfl give the
key to the success she has attained in good
works. Such women mean more to their sur-
roundings than can be told in words or meas-
ured perhaps by anj^ of our common standards.
Their number is increasing among us, and in
large degree owing to examples like that of
Mrs. Hartwell, which are a steady inspiration
both for the present and the future.



CALISTA ROBINSON .JONES, Past
National President of the Woman's
Relief Corps, was born March 22, 1S39,
in Chelsea, Vt., and during the greater
part of her life has been a resident of that State,
her home for the past twenty years and more
having been in the town of Bradford.

Her parents were Cornelius and Mary A.
(I'ike) Robinson. Her maternal grandmother,
Sophia Lyman, wife of James Pike, was a
daughter of Richard Lyman, of Lebanon, Conn.,
who inarched with others from Connecticut
"for the relief of Boston in the Lexington alarm,
April, 177.'i," and in April, 1777, enlisted for
three years under Captain Benjamin Throop,



having the rank of Sergeant in the First Regi-
ment, Connecticut line, under Colonel Jedediah
Huntington. Solomon Robinson, great-grand-
father of Cornelius Robinson, was in the battle
of Bennington.

Calista Robinson, as she was known in girl-
hood, was educated in the public schools and
academy of Chelsea and at Rutgers Female
Institute, New York City. For three years she
was a teacher in the Washington School in
Chicago. A few tlays after the attack on Fort
Sumter, with the assistance of three other
teachers she made a regulation fifteen-foot
bunting flag, every star of which was sewed
on by hand. This was the first flag to float
over a school-house in Chicago. She assisted
in distributing supplies to the thousands of
troops who passed through that city en route
for Washington. Returning to Vermont in
1864, she was marrietl in Chelsea, September
8 of that year, to Charles .Jones, a native of
Tunbridge, Vt., and a graduate of Chelsea
Academy. He was born .July 18, 18.37.

When a Relief Corps auxiliary to Washburn
Post, G. A. R., was formed in Bradford, \'t.,
Mrs. Jones became a charter member, serving
as President two years and holding some office
ever since. The Department Convention of
Vermont elected her successively Junior Vice-
President, Senior Vice-President, and Presi-
dent. She has served on important commit-
tees in the State and national organizations,
and has been active as a member of the Ander-
sonville Prison Board of the National W. R. C.
After doing effective work as Department
Patriotic Instructor, she was appointetl a mem-
ber of the first National Committee on Patriotic
Instruction. She was National Junior Vice-
President in 1899, and at the convention held
in Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 1901, she
was elected National President, receiving a
unanimous vote. She performed the duties
of this office in an admirable manner, and her
address delivered in Washington, Otober 9,
at the session of the Twentieth National Con-
vention, was received with approval. A few
extracts are here given: "The Twentieth Na-
tional Convention marks the close of the sec-
ond decade in the history of the Woman's Re-
lief Corps. The history of the first decade

was OIK' largely cxpcriinciital and character-
ized by most rayiul growtli in nunibpr.« and de-
velopment. . . . Now we tind ourselves look-
ing out over a field of work limitl»'ss in extent,
and we find ourselves, too, most admirably
prepared to carry forward the lines of work
projected to reach, if possible, the highest ideal
ever set for woman's work.

"This year, 1901-1002, has been a remark-
ably successful one from every standpoint. . . .
This has been brought about because the time
was ripe, the officers of the administration
wonderfully cajiable for the places they were
called to fill; the spirit of the day was for pros-
perity, for advancement.

" It is with feelings of great satisfaction that
I am permitteil to tell you to-day that never
were Memorial Sunday and Memorial Day
more generally observed than in the year 1902.

"Contributions to the Southern Memorial
Day fund came with much promptness from
corps and also from indivitlual members, in
many instances accompanied with letters filled
with patriotic enthusiasm. There was in the
hands of the national treasurer, from last year's
contribution, nine hundred and forty-two dol-
lars. This year we have .sent to the Quarter-
master-general of the Grand Army one thou-
sand six hundred and thirty-one dollars and
ninety-three cents, and there is one hundred
and thirty-three dollars and ninety-four cents
now remaining in the treasury. . . . The amount
sent South this year by the W. R. C. is the larg-
est sum ever sent in any one year. We are
most glad that the response was so generous,
and we are positively assured by the com-
mander-in-chief that the need was never greater
nor the work of decorating more thoroughly
performed. . . .

"We have formed a closer union with
the G. A. R., to whom, as Colonel Bakewell
says, ' the Woman's Relief Corps is married ' :
and in that closer union of spirit and
methods of work, in uniformity of pm'pose
and material, we must hand to our posterity a
heritage rich in the ideal teaching anil living
of a higher citizenship than we have ever
known.

" Patriotic days have been widely observed.
In response to the Flag Day letters bearing



the joint message of the (i, A. R. and W. R. ('.,
flags floated from ocean to ocean. . . .

"Work has rapidly advanced along all lines.
Flags, charts, oleographs, have been placed
in the schools. Patriotic j)rograms of rare
merit have been constantly prepared, and the
children of our land have sung 'The Star-
spangled Banner' with a new sjiirit and vigor.

" I wish especially to commend the work
of the Sons of Veterans. Their organization
is one of noble purpose, and the results of their
united efforts cannot fail to be a grand success.
I woukl also call especial attention to the open-
ing of the new educational institution, the
Sons of Veterans Memorial University, on Sep-
tember 10, at Mason City, la."

Mrs. Jones is honored in her native State,
and has filled places of responsibility in other
lines of work. She is one of the Trustees and
chairman of the Book Conunittee of tlie Brad-
ford Public Library, which was started at her
suggestion. Its beginning was in 1874, when
Mrs. Albert Bailey and Mrs. Jones went about
from house to house, and jirocured subscrip-
tions of one dollar each from sixty-three women
to a fund for the purchase of books for a li-
brary. In addition to the annual subscrip-
tions, money was obtainetl by entertainments
and lectures conducted by the association.
The books were kept at the house of Mrs. Jones,
who acted as librarian three years. At the
dedication of the present building, the gift of
John Lunn Woods, in 1895, the address was
delivered by the Hon. J. H. Benton, Jr., of
Boston, a former resident of Bradford. Re-
ferring to the work of the Ladies" I^ibrary As-
sociation, he said: "Who can measure the good
which has resulted to this comnumity from
this patient, persistent, un.selfish work of these
wise and public-spirited women? They de-
serve our jM-aise equally with him whose name
this buiUling bears. While his name is car-
ried upon the portals of your library, theirs
should be borne upon tablets upon its walls,
that in the years and generations to come those
who enjoy the benefits may not forget how
nuich they owe to those who made its existence
possilile."

Mrs. Jones is a prominent member of the
Daughters of American Revolution in \'ermont,

having been a iiicmlicr of tlic first Chapter in
th- State.

Charles Jones, the date of whose birth is
recorded above, was engaged for many years
in the insurance Inisiness in Bradford, in part-
nership with Colonel John C. Stearns. The
firm became one of the best known in that sec-
tion of Vermont. Mr. Jones held various po-
sitions of trust in Bradford, serving as presi-
dent of the Village Corporation, ^^'ater Com-
missioner, School Trustee, and director and
treasurer of the Bradford P^lectric Lighting
Company. He died in A\n-\\, 1901. The local
paper of Bradford, in the issue of April 19,
paid the following tribute to his memory;
" One of the saddest duties of our twenty years'
newspaper experience is to chronicle the death
of Charles Jones, to us a personal bereavement,
anfl shared by a large number of our citizens
outside his immediate family. His worth was
best known to those with whom he was long-
est and most intimately a.ssociated and who
were brought into closest contact with him.
He was upright and honorable, capable in all
the positions of i)ublic and private affairs which
he administered."

Mrs. Jones has one daughter, Marj^ Ellen,
who was born in Bradford, May 30, 1868.
She received her early education in the Brad-
ford public schools and academy, and then
took a five years' course, scientific and musical,
in Wellesley College, receiving the degree of
Bachelor of Science in. 1889. During a large
part of her college life she acted as secretary
for the professor of history, thus acquiring
experience that has been useful in other posi-
tions. After leaving college she taught suc-
cessively in Bradford Academy; two years at
Platt.sburg, N.Y.; in Pontiac, III.; three years
in liradford, 'N't. She was married July 6,
1899, to David Sloane Conant, who is now
serving a second term as State's Attorney for
Orange County. He is a lineal descendant
of Roger Conant, who in 1026 with a few ff)l-
lowers began the settlement of Naumkeag,
now Salem, Mass. In club and society life
Mrs. Conant has been active and useful, being
especially apt in i)lanning and carrying out
social events. Various Bradford institutions
have i^rofited much from her skill in their di-



rection, es])ocially the Public Library, in which
she has always had a keen interest. I'pon the
election of her mother to the office of National
President of the W. R. C. in 1901, Mrs. Conant
was a]ii)ointed National Secretary of the or-
ganization. She made improvements in the
books and papers, is.sued special instruction
blanks regarding reports and other work of the
order, and (lerfonned the duties of the office
in an intelligent, vigorous, and thorough man-
ner. Mr. and Mrs. Conant have two children:
Dorothy Stewart, born August 11, 1900: and
Barbara Allerton, born Novendjer 6, 1902.



CORA BELLE AYLING was born De-
cember 16, 1870, in the village of Paw
Paw, III., her parents uniting the blood
of the old Scotch Presbyterians with
that of the English. H(&gt;r father, Alfred Stain-
brook, in early life settled at his okl home as
a breeder of high-grade horses. A man of
striking personality, he represented the best
type of the pioneer, and to his little daughter
Cora, who became liis constant companion,
he was the ideal of all that was best in man-
hood. In those long days they spent in the
saddle, riding over the great ssweep of prairie,
his strong character impressed on the child
its absolute fearlessness, its sincerity, its ha-
tred of shams and hypocrisy. To this day she
is wont to exclaim, " I have yet to meet my
father's equal."

In 1880 the Stainbrooks moved to Cleve-
land, Ohio, the father becoming interested in
a manufacturing concern. Cora attended the
public schools, showing remarkable ability
in mathematics, and studied to prejjare her-
self for teaching. Her plans were abruptly
changed by the sudden death of her father
while trying to save the lives of some of his
men after an explosion of chemicals. The girl
of seventeen found herself the res])onsible head
of the family, with an invalid mother and two
young sisters de]i(&gt;ndent on her for supjDort.
She bravely confronted the problem of bread-
winning, and succeeded in maintaining the
home, giving her sisters a business education
as a basis for their own independence. For
;i time Cora held the position of book-keep(&gt;r;

but lier energies required a more active life,
and for several years she travelled through the
Middle States, representing a Chicago firm,
a cereal food house. Her salary, seventy-five
dollars a month for the first two months, was
then increased to three thousand dollars a year
and expenses. In 1894 she married Arthur
Putnam Ayling, a native of Boston, then a
glass manufacturer in Milwaukee, Wis. She
was elected treasurer of the company, the North-
ern Glass W^orks, and had ]&gt;ractical charge of
the office and sales ilepartment. In 1S98, her
health failing, the Aylings moved to a delight-
ful country house in Bridge water, Mass., where
the rest and outdoor life proved restorative.
Later, when her husband's business interests
took him to the remote Southwest, Mrs. Ayling
assumed the business management of a new
Boston publication, the Brown Book, which in
less than two years achieved a most remark-
able success. She is also the presitlent of the
Automatic Addressing Machine Company, and
has interests in various other enterprises.

Personally Mrs. Ayling is a woman of rather
slight physique, far too slight for the stress
the mind would impose upon it; but her in-
domitable will carries her through tasks that
might well deter many men. Her rather quiz-
zical gray eyes have an almost clairvoyant
power in reatling those with whom she comes
in contact. Her mind rapidly grasps the salient
points of any proposition, ignoring unimpor-
tant details, anil her deductions are seldom
in error. She places her objective points
clearly, and attains them by very direct meth-
ods, possessing strong executive ability. She
systematizes the work of her assistants, and
inspires intense loyalty in those about her.
Mrs. Ayling is a member of the New England
Women's Press Club, and was a charter member
of the Ousametiuin Club of Bridgewater.



MERCY A. BAILEY, art teacher,
Boston, was born in the town of
Wellfleet, on Cape Cod, Massachu-
setts. Her parents were the Rev.
Stephen Bailey, a native of Portsmouth, N.H.,
and his wife, Mrs. Sally Whitman Bailey,
daughter of Dr. Jonas and Mercy (Goodspeed)



\\'liitnian, of Barnstable. Miss Bailey's maternal
grandfather, Dr. Jonas Whitman (Yale Coll.,
1772), was a descendant in the fifth genera-
tion of JohnWhitman, an early settler of Wey-
mouth, Mass., who, through his daughter Sarah,
was an ancestor of President Abraham Lin-
coln. The Whitman-Lincoln line is thus .shown:
Sarah" Whitman, daughter of John,' married
about 1653 Abraham Jones; and their daugh-
ter, Sarah^ Jones, married Mordecai" Lincoln,
of Hingham, from whom the line continued
through Mordecai,^ born in 1686, who removed
to New Jersey and later to Pennsylvania; John,^
who settled in Virginia; Abraham,^ who re-
moved to Kentucky; to Thomas," father of
Abraham,' the sixteenth President of the
United States.

Miss Bailey was educateil in [jrivate schools
in Boston and at Wheaton Seminary, in Norton,
Mass. She remembers no time when she was
not busy with pencil and brush. Even as
a tiny child she thus rejjroduced the familiar
objects about her. Her parents, recognizing
her talent, wisely re.solved to have it properly
developed; and accordingly she received the
benefit of the best instruction from both native
and foreign teachers, a part of her student days
being spent in Lontlon anil Paris.

She had been a painstaking student for sev-
eral years when she accepted her first position
as a teacher of drawing in the public schools
of Dorchester, Mass. When Mr. Walter Smith
came to Boston and started the movement
for introducing the teaching of drawing in the
public and evening schools of the city, there
was a rapidly increasing ilemand for well-
trained teachers. This resulted in the found-
ing of the Normal Art School, in which Miss
Bailey has been a popular and esteemed teacher
for twenty years, teaching light and shade
drawing from animal forms and still life in
oil and water-colors. She has been a diligent
worker and student in her chosen field all her
life, continuing to draw and paint during the
years when teaching claimed the greater part
of her time. Art has held first place with her
always, society, dress, vacations, becoming mat-
ters of secondary importance. She has ex-
hibited in Boston, Philadelphia, and Western
cities, her subjects being heads, animals, and

landscapes. She has received medals from
the Mechanics' Art Association. Among her
former ])upils are many of the art instructors
at the Pratt Institute, the Cleveland Art School,
and other important educational institutions.
She was the hrst woman to be elected su])er-
visor of drawing in the public schools of Mas-
sachusetts. She lias lectured on art in vari-
ous cities.

Miss Bailey is a regular attendant of Trinity
Church, Boston, and is interested in its several
charities. Perhaps her warmest symjiathies
are enlisted for sailors, to the homes and hos-
pitals for whom many comforts find their
way from the hands of the quiet artist in her
unostentatious home at the Grundmann Stu-
dios. Miss Bailey is a member of the C-opley
Society of Boston and of the Industrial Art
Teachers' Association. She is an apostle of
thoroughness and application, and more than
one professor of fine arts to-day remembers
with gratitude her efficient training.



REBECCA AUGUSTA PICKETT, sec-
retary of the Relief Committee of the
^ Massachusetts Woman's Relief Corps,
traces her ancestry back seven gener-
ations to John Putnam, who, with his three
sons, Thomas, Nathaniel, and John, came from
Buckinghamshire, England, to Salem, Mass.,
received a grant of land in 1G41, was admitted
a freeman in 1647, and died in 1662. The line
of descent is: John,^ Captain John,* Captain
Jonathan,^ Jonathan,'' Jonathan,'' Nathan,"
Perley,^ and Perley Zebulon Montgomery Pike.'*
Jonathan* Putnam, born in 1691, married
Elizabeth'* Putnam, daughter of Joseph^ and
Elizabeth (Porter) Putnam and an elder sister
of General Israel Putnam.

Nathan" Putnam, of Uanvers, Mass., great-
grandfather of Mrs. Pickett, was wounded in
the battle of Lexington. He married Hannah
Putnam, a daughter of Dr. Amo.s"' Putnam
(John,* John,' Nathaniel," John').

Mrs. Pickett's paternal grandfather, Perley'
Putnam, was born in Danvers, Sei)temb(&gt;r 16,
1778. He was named for his uncle, Perley
Putnam, who was killed in the battle of Lexing-
ton, and whose name, with those of the other



Danvers soldiers who fell on that day, is in-
scribed on the monument in Peabody.

When in his twenty-first year Perley' Put-
nam was employed in building the famous
frigate "E.ssex," the keel of which was laid on
Salem Neck, Ajjril VA, 1799, the vessel being
launched September 30, 1799. By request of
Colf)nel William Ricker, Collector of Customs
for the district of Salem and Beverly, he pre-
sented a plan for a custom-house and store for
the town of Salem on June 19, LSIS, which
was sul)stantially accejited by the govern-
ment. The present custom-house was built
under his superintendence. He also worked
on the first Franklin Building, and erected
some of the solid houses on Chestnut and other
streets.

He was instrumental in organizing the old
Salem Mechanic Light Infantry, of which he
was Captain on the occasion of their first parade,
in 1S07. He was elected Major in 1810, pro-
moted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1811, and was
conunanding officer of the day on their fiftieth
anniversary in 1857.

In the War of 1812 he was a Major in the
United States army and assigneil to Colonel
Loring's Forty-eighth Regiment. He marched
his troops through Salem to Eastport, Me.,
taking command of Fort Sullivan, but was
obliged to cajjitulate his little garrison of fifty-
nine men (eleven of whom were sick) to the
British general. Sir Thomas Hardy. Return-
ing to Salem at the close of the war, Colonel
Putnam, as he was generally known, gave his
time and inflvience to public measures.

As chairman of the Board of Selectmen (to
which body he was elected several years in
succession), he was one of the committee that
drafted the first city charter. The honor
was accorded to him of transferring the keys
of the old town house to Leverett Saltonstall,
the first mayor of the city in 1836. Colonel
Putnam was appointed the first City Marshal
of Salem, and held that position until 1847.
He was Street Commissioner from 1846 to
1862, and was weigher and ganger for several
years in the Salem custom-hou.se. As a life-
long Democrat, he was earnest in his devotion
to the princi])les -of that ])artv. He died July
4, 1864.

Colonel Putnam was one of the founders of
the Universalist church in Salem, and was
deeply interested in the work of that denomina-
tion. He was very persevering in his researches
as an antiquarian and genealogist, collecting
many records of the Putnam family, which
since his death have been placed in the library
of the Essex Institute, and have been fre-
cjuently consulted by students of the family
history. Colonel Putnam married November
3, 1801, Betsey Preston, of Danvers. They
had three sons and seven (laughters, all born
in Salem.

Perley Z. M. Pike Putnam, .son of Colonel
Perley' and Betsey (Preston) Putnam, was
a .sea captain. He died in August, 1849, of
typhus fever, on board the brig "Messenger,"
on the west coast of Africa. He was l)uried
at .sea. His wife was Mary K. Whitney.

His daughter, Rebecca Augusta, the subject
of tliis sketch, was born Sejjtember 22, 1847,
in Salem, Mass. She married first, February

JLLIA MARIA BAKER, wife of William
James Baker, of Worcester, was born in
that city, October 13, 1830, daughter of
Sanuiel and Mary (Harrington) Perry.
In a published article by Professor Arthur
L. Perry, LL.D., entitled ''An Ancestral Re-
search," whence has been derived some of the
early historj' and genealogy that follows, the
Perry lineage is traced back to the Rev. John
Perry, of Farnborough (now Fareham, Hamp-
shire), Englantl, who died in 1621. The clergy-
man's son John, shortly after his father's death,
was apjirenticed to learn the cloth-workers'
trade. He married Johanna, daughter of Jo-
seph Holland, a cloth-worker and citizen of
London. Her father's will, dated 1659, printed
in Waters's "Genealogical Gleanings," makes
becjuests to his "son-in-law, John Perry, and
Johanna, his wife, my daughter," and their
three children. It was this John' Perry who,
accompanied by his son John,^ came to New
England and settled in AA'atertown, near Bos-
ton, near the close of the year 1666 or early in
1667.

John- Perry married in Watertown in Decem-
ber, 1667, Sarah Clary. They had nine chil-
dren, Josiah,^ born in 1684, being the seventh.
Josiah' Perry married Bethiah Cutter, daugh-
ter of Ephraim and Bethiah (Wood) Cutter and
grand-daughter of Richard' Cutter. Nathan''
Perry, born in 1718, was one of their ten chil-
dren. He married at Watertown in 1746



Hannah Fiske. The Perrys of Watertown in
colonial times were engaged in some form of
cloth-working, being mostly weavers and
tailors. Bethiah, first wife of Josiah Perry
and mother of his children, died in 1735, and
his second wife, Elizabeth, died in 1748. In
1751 Josiah and his son Nathan settled on a
farm of eighty acres on the north-western slope
of Sagatal)scot Hill (now I'nion Hill), Worces-
ter, Mass. Of this property they were joint
owners. Much of the land remains in the
hands of the family at this day.

Nathan* Perry, by occupation a farmer and
weaver, was Treasurer of Worcester County
fifteen years, also Town Treasurer most of
the time, and for many years Notary Public.
He was for twenty-three years deacon in the
old South Church. A stanch patriot in trying
times, he stood high in the confidence of his
fellow-citizens. He died in February, 1806.

Moses Perry, son of Nathan and one of a
family of eight children, was born in 1762, and
lived to be eighty years old. He succeeded to
the ownerslii|) of tlie home farm, was indus-
trious, frugal, and tlu'ifty, and although his
schooling, it is said, had been limited to six
weeks, he was nuich respected as a man of in-
telligence anil influence, a slow speaker, l)ut one
whose words carried weight. With a placid
temper he combined great force of character.
It is related of him that at a church meeting
where the members were becoming e.xcited he
arose and said: " Brethren, we are getting pretty
warm. I think we had better go home, and I
shall set the example." He then took his hat
and started. He was a deacon in the South
Church thirty-five years and in the I'nion
Church six years. His wife, Hannah Hall,
whom he married in 1791, died in November,
1861, at ninety-three years of age. She is
spoken of as having been somewhat eccentric
and "perhaps lacking balance of mind," but of
a "kindly, social nature, very fond of her
cluu'ch, and with a wond(&gt;rful memory for the
sermon." They had eight children, five sons
and three daughters. Three of the sons were
ministers of the gospel, and two were farmers,
one settling in Central New York, and the
other, Samu(&gt;l, in Worcester. Two of the
daughters married farmers. One was the



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



155



mother of fourteen children; the other, of
twelve.

SamueP Perry, the next owner and occupant
of the Worcester farm, was horn Novemljer 26,
1796, died Feliruary 12, 1878. His wife, Mary
Harrington, whom lie wedded in December,
1823, was born March 20, 1804, daughter of
Francis Harrington, Jr. She died Feliruary
18, 1869. Her grandfather Harrington bought
land in Worcester, and settled there in 1740.
When Samuel Perry married, on three sides of
his farm was a dense forest. In preparing to
make a home for his bride he cut down the
first tree at the north. He .served as a Captain
in the militia, and for thirty-five years was a
deacon of the Union Church, of which he
was one of the founders. He was very benev-
olent, a man of good judgment in affairs,
and a peacemaker in the church and neighbor-
hood. Opposed to the renting of jjews, he
took upon himself to secure subscriptions, col-
lect the money, and pay the bills. When he
could not collect what was pledged, he paitl it
himself. He had ten children. One son, David
Brainard Perry, D.D., a graduate of Yale, was
for some years a home missionary in Nebraska
and is now president of Doane College. An-
other son was a successful business man, autl
three were farmers. Of the five daughters,
four became teachers, in time marrying in-
telligent, well-to-do business men. The other
ilaughter, Mary S. Perry, who died in Worces-
ter, August 8, 1902, was much beloved as a
"woman of rare qualities of heart and mind,
of great synijiathy for the unfortunate, with
keen appreciation of the beautiful in nature, a
wide range of reading and thought, remarkable
knowledge of the Scri|)tures, and great rev-
erence for sacred things." A vohune of her
poems published during her last illness is held
as a precious legacy.

The mother, Mrs. Mary Harrington Perry, a
kindly, hospitable woman, with a charm of
manner that attracted strangers to her, was a
notable housekeeper, bringing up her chiUlren
to habits of industry and thrift. In the sick-
room she had rare tact and skill. Her simi:»le
presence was a blessing.

Julia Maria (Mrs. Baker) was the fourth child
of Deacon Sanmel Perry and his wife Maiy.



She acquired her educiition in the district school,
three-quarters of a mile from her home, the
Worcester High School, o])ened in 1846, Leices-
ter Acatlemy, and Williraham Academy. For
several years she was engaged in teaching, her
first school, in a neighboring town, being an
ungraded one of seventy-six pupils. She after-
ward taught in interm*'diate and grammar
schools. Ecjuipped with thorough knowledge
of the branches to be taught and with a native
force of character that showed itself in emer-
gencies, she brought to her work an enthusi-
asm that aroused and held the interest of her
pupils, and ensured her success as teacher and
di.sciplinarian.

On June 27, 1861, she married William James
Baker, of Worcester, a son of James and Lydia
(Gouldingj Baker. For many years Mr. Will-
iam J. Baker was in active business as a mem-
ber of the firm of Charles Baker &amp; Co., of Worces-
ter, lumber manufacturers and dealers. Owing
to failing health he retired from business cares
about five years ago.

Mrs. Baker brought up from babyhood a
niece of her husband's, a child whose father,
a minister, had died. Later God bestowed
upon her a baby boy who has since grown to
a jjromising manhood, being of strong char-
acter and good business ability.

Mrs. Baker is a member of Union Church, of
the Congregational denonnnation, and has
taken a jirominent part in church work. For
eight years she was deaconess under the pastor-
ates of Drs. Stlmson and Davis, and during
that time she had charge of the women's prayer
meeting, and also had the main care of si.xteen
families. Her helpers were not suited to the
woi'k, or were too busy or were too easily dis-
couraged. She has since contimied it, having
cared for .some of the families up to this day.
Her reward has been in seeing them prosper,
become members of the church and useful
members of the community. Mrs. Baker keeps
up her interest in some of those whom she has
thus helped, and still corresponds with tho.se
who have moved away from Worcester. She
was formerly vice-president of a literary society
in Wilbraham, most of the time acting, owing
to the sickness of tht&gt; president. She possesses
rare tact and skill in nursing, inherited from



156



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



her mother, and developed by practical experi-
ence through long periods of severe sickness in
both her own and in h(&gt;r jiarents' family. For
a number of year!&gt; she lias kept a home for
teachers of the high school, of both the normal
and other grades, having sometimes four in the
family, and this because so few are wiUing to
receive them. She hs^ derived nmch pleasure
and benefit by reading and studying with them,
thus kee{)ing in touch mentally with the active
workers of the younger generation.

Mrs. Baker's reminiscences of her girlhood
give interesting pictures of country life in the
thirties and forties of last century. "Every
daughter," she says, "had her work planned
and systematized. Those were strenuous
times. The family rose at five in the morning,
even in winter, getting and eating breakfast
by candle-light." Beside the ordinary work
of hoasekeeping there was much to be done
at special times in the course of the year.
Among other things she sjiecifies the "cider to
be 1)oiled down, barrels of apple sauce to be
made for home use and for regular customers,
apples to be cut and dried, cucumbers to be
pickled, yeast cakes to be made antl dried for
the coming year, pumpkins to be cooked and
dried, sausages to l)e made, candles to be
clipped or later run in moulds."

" I remember the cooking of chickens and
turkeys on the spit of the tin kitchen set be-
fore the open fire, the baking of johnny-cake
on a wooden form, the first rotary stove and
the pleasure of turning it. (irandfather was
very busy at the sho]) with his loom in those
early days. He wove our woollen sheets for
winter use, also the material for our winter
gowns, ^'ery warm and strong it was. During
vacations we were taught to liraid straw, each
having her stint of so many yards of braiding,
and then knitting so many times round before
we could go out to play." Mental diversion
was sometimes happily combined with work,
so that it was "not always drudgery." Then,
too, there were special seasons of festivity and
fun. "Thanksgiving Days were times to be
looked forward to and prepanMJ for the whole
previous year. As years pas.sed on, the tables,
l)ountifully spread, grew larger and larger. In
the evening all kinds of games were played, the



father, the youngest player of all, the evening
ending with singing, Bible reatling, and prayer."
Considering herself ])rimarily a home-maker,
caring for husband and .son, and exercising hos-
pitality, Mrs. Baker continues in her old-time
habits of reading and study. For leisure hours
she finds congenial employment in making
scraii-books. Of these she has "many for
many purposes," and she hopes they will be
pleasing and useful to the coming generation.
Looking back, she says: "Certain physical and
mental traits have descended through all the
generations — strong constitutions, long lives,
large families, habits of industry, good mental
abilities, and a high standard of morals."



ISABICL NORTON HOLBROOK, of Hol-
brook and I-5oston, Mass., for .several years
Regent of Paul Revere Chapter, Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution, and now
one of the three honorary State Regents of that
society, is a native of New London, Merrimack
County, N.H. Born February 14, 1841, daugh-
ter of AValter Powers Flanders and his wife,
Susan Everett Greeley, she numbers among
her ancestors many colonial worthies whose
names are woven into the history of New Eng-
lanfl. Among them was Major-general Hum-
phrey Atherton, who held many positions of
honor, both civil and military, and at the time
of his death, in ItiGl, was commander-in-chief
of the colonial forces. Another was Tristram
Coffin, who.se descendants trace their lineage
back to the Nantucket home with pride; and
beside these were .lames Trowbridge, John
Whipple, Edward Jackson, John \A'ard, and
Ebenezer Stone, all prominent men in the early
days of Newton and C'amljridge. Of the fifteen
ancestors under whom Mrs. Holbrook ({uali-
fied for membership in the Society of Colonial
Dames, nine were Deputies to the General
Court. P'oiu- of her ancestors — namely, Ste-
phen Harriman, Stephen Harriman, Jr., Eben-
ezer Shepard, and Joseph Greeley — served in
the Revolutionary War, the last two as minute-
men on the alarm of the battle of Lexington.

Walter Powers Flanders was born in ^^'arner,
N.H., March 29, 1X05. He died in Milwaukee,
^^'is., January 24, LS83. He was son of I']zra

and Lucy {Harriiiian) FlandtTs and a lineal
descendant of Stephen Flanders, an early in-
habitant of Salisbury, Mass. The family to
which his inotlu'r belonged was founded by
Leonard Harriinan, who was of Rowley, Mass.,
as early as 1649.

Walter P. Flanders was graduated at Dart-
mouth College in 18.'U. He became an able
and successful lawyer in New Hampshire, and
was for several years a member of the Legis-
lature. He removed to Milwaukee, Wis., in
1848. He was treasurer of the Milwaukee and
Prairie du Chien Railroad, and later had large
landed interests.

Susan Everett Greeley, who became the wife
of AValter Powers Flanders, September 2.S,1834,
was born in New London, N.H., January 8,
1811. She died in Milwaukee, Wis., May 10,
1888. In the History of New London, N.H.,
the pleasant hill town where nearly half her
life was spent, she is reverently recorded as
a "woman of rare mental endowment and singu-
larly beautiful character." She was a daugh-
ter of Squire Jonathan and Polly (Shepard)
Greeley and the youngest of a family of seven
children. Her mother was a daughter of
Lieutenant Ebenezer Shepard, of Dedham,
Mass., and New London, N.H., who married
Jane McCordy. Her father, Jonathan Greeley,
was a son of Joseph and Prudence (Clement)
Greeley, of Haverhill, Mass., and traced his
descent from Andrew Greeley, who was an
original proprietor of Salisbury, Massachusetts
Bay Colony.

Isabel Norton Flanders was eilucated at
Milwaukee College, one of the pioneer insti-
tutions devoted to the higher education of
women, and noted for thoroughness of train-
ing. She was gratluated in 1858, and later
was for many years a member of the board
of trustees of the. college. She was married
February 11, 1862, tc^ William Lafayette Dana,
general freight agent of the Milwaukee and
Prairie du Chien Railroad. Mr. Dana died
two years later, and she resided with her
parents in Milwaukee until February 7, 1889,
when she was married to F.. Everett Holbrook.
Mr. and Mrs. Holbrook spend their sununers
in Holbrook, Mass., at the homestead fif Mr.
Holbrook's father, Elisha Niles Holbrook, after



whom the town was named and fiom whom it
received the town hall and ])ublic library.
Their winter residence is in Boston, and they
enjoy fre([uent seasons of foreign travel.

Mrs. Holbrook's ancestry has had its rightful
influence, and she is warmly interested in pa-
triotic work. Under her regency the Paul
Revere Chapter, Daughters of the American
Revolution, began its etlucational work for
boys, instructing them in American history
and the principles of good citizenship, under
the sujjervision of the Denison House. Mrs.
Holbrook is one of the vice-presidents of the
New England Won)en's Club, a director of the
Woman's Home Missionary Association, and
a trustee of the Holbrook Public Library. She
has been a member of the Congregational church
since her sixteenth year, and for many years
in Milwaukee was active in the work of
Plymouth Chui-ch and Sunday-school. She
was also for thirteen years secretary of tlu;
Milwaukee Home for the Friendless.



ANGIE ADELE ROBINSON, past Pres-
/\ ident of the Department of Massachu-
X \. setts. Woman's Relief Corps, is one
of the representative women of Worces-
ter, her native place, and is known throughout
the State for her great interest in patriotic
work.

She was born August 6, 1843, daughter of
Timothy Eliot and Sarah Hadaway (Bartlett)
Kidder. Her paternal grandfather was Tim-
othy Kidder; her maternal grandfather, John
Hadaway Bartlett. She was educated in pri-
vate schools, of which there were many in
Worcester at that time. At the age of ten
years she began the study of nmsic under the
instruction of Miss Frances Kidder, an aunt.
Later she was a pupil of Eugene Thayer, the
eminent organist, of Boston. She continued
these studies several years, but, owing to re-
verses in the family, was unable to carry out
her plan and obtain a thorough musical eiluca-
tion.

The marriage of .\ngie Adele Kidder and Wil-
liam Lyman Robinson, a native of Barre, Vt.,
and in boyhootl and youth a resident of Con-
cord, N.lf., tocjk place August 7, 1861. This



158



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



was tlic opening year of the Civil \\'ar and, as
she says, " a trying time to make a start in the
world." Mrs. Robinson's brother, George Mor-
timer Kidiler, enlisted in September, 1861, in
Company C, Fourth New Hampshire Regiment,
was taken prisoner at the battle of Deep Bot-
tom (or Deep Cut, as it is sometimes called),
and suffered in Libby, Belle Tsle, and Salisbury
Prisons for nearly ten months. He was paroled
March 9, 1865, but lived only eleven days after
reaching his home in Worcester. His death
occurred just before the surrender of General
Lee, the news of which he was anxious to hear.
Relincjuishing a good position, in July, 1863,
Mr. Robinson enlisted, and was enrolled in the
United States navy and credited to the cpiota
of New Hampshire.

Before her marriage Mrs. Robinson had made
jackets for the State militia in AA'orcester, and
she continued to work for the soldiers through-
out the war. She had many kinsmen and
friends in the army, to whom she frequently
sent letters and supplies. She was an eye-
witness of the departure of numerous com})anies
and regiments, as they passed through Worces-
ter, and a frequent visitor at Camp Lincoln
and Camp Scott in that city. "These scenes,"
she says, " are vivid in my mind and will never
be erased."

When the Grand Army of the Republic began
its beneficent work, Mrs. Robinson renewed her
efforts for the veteran, in whose welfare she
had never ceased to take an interest. She was
a charter member of Relief Corps No. 11, auxil-
iary to George H. Ward Post, No. 10. The
Hon. Alfred S. Roe, a Past Commander of Post
No. 10, refers to her local Grand Army work
as follows: —

" From the beginning Mrs. Angle Adele Rob-
inson has been one of the most enthusiastic and
efficient workers in the Relief Corps of AVorces-
ter. Seeing her brother go into the service as
a member of the Fourth New Hampshire In-
fantry, and herself wedded in 1861 to William
Lyman Robinson, who did his patriotic duty
in the navy in those troublous days, it was very
natural that her very being should be bound
up in the progress and issue of the struggle.
It was her fortune as a girl to help make jackets
worn l)v the Massachusetts militiamen in their



April trip to Baltimore and Washington, giving
to the work all the time there was, Sundays
includetl. As a wife and mother she could tell
the whole story of the anxiety which followed
the absent husband and father. Her interest
in the families of in&lt;ligent and suffering veter-
ans did not await for its application the or-
ganization of the Relief Corps. Long before
the good women of the land had formed their
invaluable band, she had sought out and helped
relieve the wants of many a suffering house-
hold. Thus, when the organization was pro-
jected, she was ready to become one of the
earliest members and one of the workers from
the start. Serving in the liome corps in about
all the offices there were, she has repeatedly
represented the same in the State and national
liodies. Among the many excellent presiding
officers whom the local and department organ-
izations have had, it will not be tof) much to
state that no one has ever performed her duties
more intelligently or effectually. Thoroughly
posted in the working programme of the order,
ready in thought and speech, graceful in action,
her accomplishment of each and every assign-
ment is a source of pleasure and pride to her
friends; but, above all, her loyal devotion to
the ends and aims of the Relief Corps, namely,
the helping of those in distress, marks her as
one of- the most .successful and gracious of
Worcester's women."

Mrs. Robinson has been a jjrominent partici-
pant in the State conventions of the Woman's
Relief Corps for many years. She has been a
member of the Department Executive Board,
Department .lunior Mce-President, Senior A'ice-
President, and at the annual convention held
in Boston, February, 1899, she was luiani-
mously elected Department President. Her
tact, good judgment, and business ability were
manifest throughout the year.

In the discharge of her duties while thus
standing at the head of o\'er fourteen thousantl
women, she attended many gatherings under
the auspices of posts and corps in all sections
of the State. Referring in her report to this
part of her duties, she said: —

"(.)f the very many invitations received the
past year, I have been alile to accept all, ex-
cept where dates condicteil ■ and then I detailed



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



159



one of the ilepartnient officers to represent the
department. As I look back, it seems as if
I had been on the road the entire year, arriving
at my home for Sundays only. I cannot take
the space to enumerate all the diffeient gather-
ings that I have attentled, l)ut they have been
many. I began like a dutiful citizen by pay-
ing my respects to our Governor, and closed
by attending the dedication of the beautiful
hall of Hartsuff Corps, of Rockland. Among
the delightful occasions was the reception ten-
dered me by my own corps, March 11, 1S99:
and it is a pleasure to know that the honor that
had come to one of its members was so highly
appreciated by the members of the corps."

Intensely loyal to the Grand Army of the
R,epublic and pleased to note that all the corps in
the department were working in harmony with
their posts, she urged the making of greater
efforts to assist them in the years to come.

At the reception given in Berkeley Temple
at the close of her administration, February 14,
1900, her work was referretl to in compliment-
ary terms by John E. Gilman, who that day
retired from the ofhce of Department Com-
mander, and by other prominent frientls. Mrs.
Robinson subsequently resumed her active
work for the local corps in Worcester, serving
on the Relief Committee, of which she has been
a member eighteen years.

During the years of the Spanish-American
War she gave nearly six months of her time
to the work of the Volunteer Aid Association.
Major Edward T. Raymond, clerk of the Central
District Court of Worcester, who was officially
identified with the \'olunteer Aid Association
work in that city, thus i-efers to her services: —

" Mrs. Angle Adele Robinson, of Worcester,
was among the first to rally to the assistance
of the sokliers of the late war with Spain and
their families. Her work from May IS, 189S,
to November 3, 1898, was having charge of the
relief and relief workers established l)y the
Worcester A'olunteer Aid Association. During
the time she assisted some four hundred soldiers
and their families. She worked early and late,
and it was work of the most trying and nerve-
exhausting kind. To answer the thousands of
(luestions and endure at times the soinewhat
ungracious remarks of those who were seeking



help fell to her lot. She solicited clothing of all
kinds, and fitted out many soldiers' families.
Only those who have pas,sed through a similar
experience can understand what she passed
through. Her work was p,erformed not for
pecuniary reward, Mrs. Robinson having vol-
unteered her services. The Executive Com-
mittee of the Vohmteer Aid Association pa.ssed
a vote comuientling her work and thanking her
for her faithful attention to the suffering soldiers
and their families."

By invitation of the Woman's Unitarian
League of Worcester, Mrs. Robinson recently
prepared and read a paper upon the \'ohmteer
Aid work, which siie also read by request at
Northboro, Mass., and also before the Ladies'
Society of the Central Church. This paper,
which is a record of experiences in a work that
^^ill always be memorable, she designated by
the title "The Sununer's Campaign on the Home
Side."

Mrs. Robinson is a meihber of the District
Nurse Association of Worcester, also of the
Woman's Employment Society, a charitable
organization which assists women and children.

Mr. Freeman Brown, clerk of the Board of
Overseers of the Poor of Worcester, pays the
following tribute to her work of charity: —

" In the first place, Mrs. Robinson is a noble
woman. By nature, by training, by environ-
ment, by devotion to duty, by living for the
benefit and comfort of others less fortunate
than herself, she is a s])lenditl representative
of true New England womanhood, the best in
the world. Her work in the Woman's Relief
Corps, both locally and in the State, is a matter
of record, known throughout the country. It
is a record of which every i-esident of Worces-
ter is proud, and in thus honoring her city and
her State she has brought honor upon herself.
\A'ith the \'olunteer Aid Association during the
Spanish- American War in 1898, Mrs. Robinson
did grand service for the boys who fought under
the stars and stripes. Her work in this con-
nection, like that in the work in the Woman's
Relief ("orps, is also a matter of record.

" For four years Mrs. Robinson has been a
visitor of the Worcester Employment Society,
visiting poor families regularly each month in
the vear. It is of her unrecorded charitable

work and ministration of conifort to those in
distress that I will speak. While Mrs. Robin-
son has found time to perform an enormous
amount of work of a pul)lip nr semi-public
nature, she has qlso pinched out an hour or
day from such work to visit the unknown sick,
to collect and disburse comforts antl delicacies
to those in distress, and to give a guiding liand
in the affairs of families helpless because of in-
efficiency or shiftlessness. One or two specific
cases described is better than a column of gen-
eralities. One family to which she was called
consisted of a husband, wife, and eight small
children. Husband a drinking man, wife a
drinking woman, who had led a life of de-
bauchery and was in the last stages of consump-
tion. Home barren of furniture and even of the
commonest utensils of a kitchen outfit. To
this miserable home Mrs. Robinson went out one
night and nvu'sed the sick woman for .several
days, until the jwor unfortunate passed on to
the great majority. Few women occupying
Mrs. Robinson's sphere in life would have
deigned to leave their own comfortable homes
and become a nurse in a stranger's house, and
still fewer the number who would venture into
a household of squalor and vermin to perform
the noble service."

Mrs. Robinson is a member of the Benevolent
Committee of the First Universalist Church of
Worcester, and is one of the leading workers of
the church. The Rev. Almon Gunnison, D.D.,
President of St. Lawrence University, Canton,
N.Y., a former pastor, thus speaks of her: —

"Mrs. Robinson has been for many years
prominently associated with the First Univer-
salist Church of Worcester, Mass. She has held
the position of president of the Ladies' Social
Circle, one of the largest and oldest organiza-
tions of the church. The position called for
many and varied duties, all of which she dis-
charged with marked ability. Possessing great
dignity of manner, she presided over the meet-
ings of the organization with grace and force,
fulfilling the manifold executive functions of
the place with great skill and tact. A forceful
and graceful speaker, she was conciliatory in
manner, and had great energy in pushing to
completion her various plans. !\Irs. Robinson
has never permitted her public work to inter-



fere with or mar her administiation of her
home. Her husband and children mingle admi-
ration with their affection, for she has ever been
.solicitous in looking after their welfare. Tlie
home has been the place to which the childnni
have ever returned with pleasure, and the wife
and mother has omitted no duty. One of lier
daughters is a student at St. Lawrence Uni-
versity."

Of her experience in relief work, Mrs. Robin-
son says: "I have taken pleasure in giving my
time, means, and efforts to this work. It is a
great education in many ways, and has assisted
me in a knowledge of how to bring up my chil-
dren, which, for all this outside work, I have
done, having n(&gt;ver in any way neglectetl their
education or good health. I believe a mother
should mingle with the world and take an in-
terest in matters outside the home, in order to
be capal:)le of teaching her children as they
should be taught. A mother is — or should he —
a teacher through her entire life to her children."

Mr. and Mrs. Robinson have six children,
namely: George K., born P'ebruary 11, 1864;
Angle 'M. (now Mrs. Ewen), born May 19, 1867;
William L., Jr., born August 25, 1871; Harry
C, born April 7, 1873; M. Beatrice, born Ai)ril
29, 1880; Sarah Isabel E., born December 21,
1881. All were born in Worcester except the
eldest daughter, whose birthplace is Cambridge-
port, Mass. The three sons are prosperous
business men, and Harry C. is also prominent in
musical circles.



ELLEN MARIA FOGG was born in
Salem, Mass., in 1828, diuighter of
Stephen and Lucinda (Goldthwait)
Fogg. From the age of four 3'ears to
that of thirteen the sul:iject of this sketch was
a pupil at a young ladies' school. From that
time until reaching the age of sixteen she at-
tended a school kept liy Henry K. Oliver, a
teacher of high rank and for many years an
esteemed ]iublic official (sometime Adjutant-
general of Massachusetts militia and later State
Treasurer). Miss Fogg excelled in her studies,
particularly in mathematics and astronomy.
Her proficiency in these branches is evidenced
by the fact that when her teacher requested



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



161



some members of the class to calculate an
eclipse, and two of the pupils agreed to calcu-
late an eclipse of the moon, she undertook the
more difficult task of calculating the next total
eclipse of the sun, her calculation proving cor-
rect to a minute.

In after years, as Genei'al Oliver livetl near
her, Miss Fogg usetl frequently to call on him.
Upon one such occasion, as they were talking
of old school ilays, he spoke of the calculation
of the eclipse, and asked her whether she still
htid the paper on which she had worked it out,
and what she was going to do with it. She
replied that it was rolled up in a box, and she
was not going to do anything with it. "Will
you give it to me?" he asked. She consented
and took it to him, and he thereupon presented
it to the Essex Institute in Salem, where it
now is.

She had several years of happy home life
after leaving school, being active in church
work and always keeping up with current liter-
ature; arut, when her father and mother hail
passed away, she went abroatl for a year. She
spent same time in Germany, to perfect herself
in the German language, and then, leaving in
Germany the friends she ha'i been with uj) to
that time, she visited Russia in company with
a young lady whom she had met in Italy, and
who had requested permission to j(jin her.
This journey was a new and delightful experi-
ence. When they arriveil in Russia, they took
a carriage to the best Russian hotel. There was
a fine English hotel, but Miss Fogg preferred
when in Russia to see Russian life. It was a
fine hotel, and, as they found that German
was spoken there, they experienced no diffi-
culty in making themselves -understood. But,
after partaking of a light lunch, Miss Fogg
thought it best, as everything was new and
strange, to see the American minister, and
asked for a carriage. They were taken directly
to his office, and received a cordial welcome.
Through his kindly offices their way was
smoothed, they found comfortable acconnnoda-
tions and ready service, and, when they re-
sumed their travels, a courier was provided anil
their journey facilitatcil in every possible way.
After leaving Russia, Miss Fogg proposed to
her friend that they should extend their travels



to the nortli, and they therefore crossed over
and visited Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.
An account of their visit to St. Petersburg and
Moscow was prepared by Miss Fogg in tlie form
of two lectures, one on St. Petersburg and one
on Moscow, which she has read in private
parlors several times to large and appieciative
audiences.

Miss Fogg has also visiteil Sorrento, Capri,
and the Blue Grotto, and was the last, with
one or two friends, to make a partial ascent of
Mount ^'esuvius just before one of its notable
eruptions. An account of these travels, written
to a friend, was published, unknown to her, in
a New York paper In June, 1883, she had the
great pleasure of seeing the Passion Play per-
formed at Brinlegg, in the Austrian Tyrol; and
she wrote a full account of it, which was pub-
lished in the Church Eclectic, covering ten pages.

Between her two visits to Europe, Miss Fogg
spent several winters in New York, and while
there translated for a clerical friend two French
theological works, one of which was published.
She eilited the Girls' Friendly Magazine as
long as it was published in Boston. For sev-
eral years she also reviewed new books for the
Church Eclectic. When she came to Boston,
after several winters spent in New York, slie
was asked to take a class in church history,
and consented reluctantly, being doubtful of
her own ability; but, with careful study she
carried on the class through the winters, giving
thirteen lectures, one every Satunlay morning,
an hour long, to a class of thirty young ladies.

Miss Fogg converses about her travels in an
entertaining and instructive manner. Her de-
scriptions of scenes bring them vividly before
her hearers. She has some beautiful souve-
nirs gathered from places of note. Her lecture
on Russia, a country which so few visit in their
trips abroad, written wholly from her own ex-
perience, is especially interesting and instruc-
tive; and, through the solicitation of students
and artists who have travelled abroad, this,
with her other lectures, will soon be pub-
lished.

While in Rome Miss Fogg made a collection
of pictures to illustrate her copy of Hawthorne's
tald, "The Marble Faun; or, The Romance of
Monte Beni," in England published under the



162



RErRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



title "Transformation." The fifty-five pictures
bound up in her book add very much to its in-
terest and vahie.

A communicant of the Episcopal church,
Miss Fogg is also a member of the Dorcas So-
ciety of St. Stephen's, of tiie Educational and
Industrial Union, the Girls' Frientlly Society,
and an associate of St. Margaret's.



MARY E. M.\cGREr.()ft, of Portland,
the president of the Maine Home
for Friendless Boys and widely
known in connection with the child-
saving work of the State, was born in Portland,
being the daughter of George S. and Ellen
(Merrill) Barstow. Her father was a merchant
in that city, and her mother a writer of both
prose and ver.se, with several children's books
to her credit. (See .sketch of Mr.s. MacGregor's
sister, Mrs. Augusta M. Hunt.)

Mary E. Barstow (now Mrs. MacGregor) was
educated in the public schools of Portland,
completing her course of study in the high
school. On November 12, 1!S59, she was mar-
ried to Gains B. MacGregor, of Lock Haven,
Pa., the descendant of a long line of sturdy
Scottish ancestors, all of marked nuisical abil-
ity. His grandfather MacGregor, who was a
Revolutionary soldier, married Betsey Bellows,
whose family, it is said, figured co.nspicuously
in the early history of A'ennont, her father
being an eminent jurist.

The early married life of Mrs. MacGregor was
|)assed in States west of New F^-nglnnd. Twenty-
two years ago she returned to her native city,
where at present she is known as tlie "children's
frieml."

The society for the protection and care of
friendless and destitute Ijoys of Maine was es-
tablished February 9, 1S98. After two years
of practical experience in placing boys for
adoption in country or city homes, and thus
removing them from vicious surroundings, it
was deemed wise to establish a home where
neglected boys might have proper care until
permanent places could be obtained for them.
The actual necessity for such a temijorary
home was shown in the fact that many boys,
taken from bad surroundings and sometimes



inheriting evil tendencies, required special train-
ing and some refining influences before they were
eligible for permanent homes. Accordingly a
building was leased, November, 1895, to be
known as the Maine Home for Friendless Boys.
I'urnishings and some money were solicited,
but, as no assured fund was forthcoming, special
effort has been made constantly for this ])nr-
pose. A new l)uilding was erected in Portland,
and formally opened in February, 1901. The
success and present prosjjerity of the home is
due largely to the energy and per.severance of
Mrs. MacGregor, the president and the originator
of the ])lan of work. She lias interested Maine
peoi:)le in the enterj^rise, and to-day the insti-
tution represents in a large degree her labor
and influence.

For the i)ast twelve years Mrs. MacGregor
has been an indefatigable worker in the Fresh
Air Society of Portland, of which she was one
of the original founders. She served most ac-
ceptably for twelve years as a director of the
Female Samaritan Association, and then re-
signed the jiosition to devote her time to the
Home for Boys.

Aside from philanthropic work, she is prom-
inently known in social and literary circles of
Portland, her connection with the Monday Club
(one of the first women's clubs organized in
that cit)') extending over a period of twenty
years. As a member of the Woman's Literary
Union, her influence has been helpful, both
through contributions from her pen and her
efforts to establish a high ideal.

Mrs. MacGregor is a most a])proachable,
sympathetic woman, ever nvidy to do some-
thing toward lightening tlic bvu'dcns of the
sorrowing.

Ellen B.\rst()w M.\cGhecor, of Portland,
Me., the daughter of Gains B. and Mary E. ( Bar-
stow) MacGregor, was educated at Temple Grove
Seminary, Saratoga, N.Y., where she ranked
high as a student. She is now well known as a
])ianist and com])o.ser. She inherited her nuisical
talent from her father's family, who claim some
noted nmsicians of the past. When only two
3'ears of age she conunitted to memory a num-
ber of tunes, and accurately sang them. At
the age of five siie comj)ose(l little pieces, which



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



163



she would play on the piano, giving a left -ham 1
accompaniment, while the remarkable memory
for committing music began to develop also.
Miss MacGregor has had the benefit of the best
instruction in piano playing, harmony, and
counteri)oint, umler Carl Baermann, of Boston,
Dudley Buck, of New York, and other leatling
teachers. Her first compositions of instru-
mental music were marches, which have re-
ceiveil the commendation of Ciilmore, Sousa,
Jean Mi.ssud, and other leading band-masters
in this country, who have paid her the high
compliment of adapting and ])laying them on
important occasions. At the Maine Musical
Festival given in Portland in October, 1899,
her compositions were jilayed, and received
great favor. Of late she has been turning her
attention with marked success to song-writing
almost exclusively, and numbers among her
productions some very taking songs: a luUaby,
"We're sailing to Dreamland" (with violin obli-
gato); "My Phyllis"; "The Old Love"; Sere-
nade; "Now and Then"; and "() Lassie, be
True to me," a Scottish song for contralto, which
has been received most favorably. ( )f her in-
strumental music the "Dirigo March," "The
Bowdoin," "The Gaiety" (two-step), and the
"Colonial Dames Waltzes" are best known.
Some of her most recent compositions are:
"Little Gems for Little Folks" (a set of eight
pieces for piano), and "The Fadette Two-step,"
dedicated to Carohne Nichols, leader of Fatlctte
Woman's Orchestra.

As a prominent member of the Rossini Club,
an organization of Portlanil ladies, she is iden-
tified with the musical interests, not only of
Maine, but of all New England. She is a
member of the Shubert Concert Company (as
pianist and accompanist), and has been a mem-
ber of the Boston Lleal (,)uartette (miscellane-
ous). Miss MacGregor has ixho given a numljcr
of muscal lecture recitals on famous composers,
besides one on " Contemporary Women Com-
posers," and two others entitled res|);--ctively
" Development of the Op^ra," and " Formation
of the Ballad," all illustrated by nms-c. Her
services musically have always been freely given
for charity, and few nuisiciaiis have contributed
more lilierally of their talent and time than Miss
MacGregor.



/4DELAIDE A. HOSMER CALKINS,

/ \ of Springfield, Ma.ss., was born in
X A. ^^'est Boylston, AVorcester County,
where her paternal ancestors settled
before the Revolution. She is the daughter
of the late Ebenezer Mason Hosmer and Mary
Cheney, his wife, and is of pure English stock.
She is descended from the colonial family of
James Ho.smer, who came to America from
Hawkhurst, England, in 1635, and settled in
Concord, Mass.

Mrs. Calkins acquired her education in the
schools of her native town, Wilbraham Acad-
emy, and Charlestown Female Seminary, the
last named being a flourishing institution in
its time, conducted by Miss Martha Whiting,
who stood high among the educators of the
State. In 1855 she (Adelaide A. Hosmer)
married Dr. Marshall Calkins, and in 1S60
they took up their residence in Springfield.
Of this union there is one child, Dr. Cheney
Hosmer Calkins, an oculist, residing in Spring-
field.

In 1865 the Home for Friendless Women
antl Children was organized. Mrs. Calkins
became a manager in 1867, and for the ten
succeeding years was active in its work, serv-
ing on the Children's Conunittee.

In 1877 she was appointed by Governor
Rice one of an advisory board of three women
to the State Board of Charities, and was its
chairman, its duties being to inspect quarterly
the Tewskbury almshouse and the State
primary and reform schools, and report upon
the same. The following year the advisory
board was abolished, and its members ap-
pointed as trustees of the same institutions,
where tlirect power rather than advisory could
be exercised. Heretofore the trustees govern-
ing State institutions, except those for women
only, were composed entirely of men.

Mrs. Calkins being appointed on the trustee
board of the State primary and reform schools,
the State primary at once engaged her most
careful attention. This congregate institution,
with its system of herding hundretls of chil-
dren together with the fewest possible chances
for the right develo]Mnent of mind and body,
had appealed to Mrs. Calkins while a member
of the advi.sory board as a subject Un reform.



164



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



In her now position she interested lier ussoeiate
trustees, the State Boanl of Charities, and the
local press in the matter. As a result the man-
agement was radically changed, and by act
of Legislature, 1879-80, the young wards of
the State between four and ten years of age
might be placed at board in suitable families.

Mrs. Calkins declined reappointment as a
trustee in July, 1880, anil accepted appoint-
ment on a newly created board of auxiliary
visitors to the vState Board of Charities, con-
sisting of five women. The object of the or-
ganization was to secure voluntary women
visitors in different sections of the State to
visit regularly the dependent and delinquent
children ])laced in families. More than fifty
women engaged in the work. Up to this time
all official visitors of State children were men.

Mrs. Calkins also accepted at this time the
responsil)ility of beginning the work of plac-
ing young children at board in Western Massa-
chusetts and visiting them quarterly. In this
voluntary work she continued until the sum-
mer of 1883, when the success and growth of
the work necessitated the entire time of a
supervising visitor, and, a salaried officer l)eing
appointed, Mrs. Calkins retired.

In 1878 Mrs. Calkins took uj) the work of
the Union Relief Association, then established
in Springfield for the purpose of preventing
pauperism by helping the poor to help them-
selves, and was among its first corps of visitors.
Its first notable work was the investigation
of the condition of the city almshouse, and
as a result she was soon after included in a
committee to go before the Legislature to urge
a change in the law regarding children in alm.s-
houses, so that no young child could be i)lace(l
in an almshouse without its mother. Out of
this successful movement grew the present
Hampden County Children's Aid Society.

In 1883 a committee of visitors, with Mrs.
Calkins as chairman, was appointed to organ-
ize a day nur.sery and raise funds for its sup-
port. To this nursery in 1885 were succes-
sively added a labor bureau and an industrial
laundry. These several departments were soon
successfully united in a building of their own
under the name of the Industrial House Char-
ities. This institution has continued its help-



ful work in caring for infants, teaciiing laun-
dr3nng, and providing ])laces for days' work
for destitute widows and deserted wives with
young children and other j)r)or women.

In 1879 Mrs. Calkins was apj^ointed by
Mayor Powers one of the first board of trus-
tees of the City Hospital, and more especially
for its reorganization, as up to that time it
had no medical staff or systematic hospital
management. Mrs. Calkins is still a member
of the corporation of the SpringfieUl Hospital,
an outgrowth of the former institution.

In 1883 Mrs. Calkins resigned from all char-
ity boards except that of the day nursery, and
accompanied her husband and son to Europe
for a period of rest, study, and recreation.
She improved this opportunity to visit chari-
table institutions ami schools in London and
Vienna, oKserving their methods and manage-
ment.

In 1886 Mrs. Calkins was elected a member
of the school conuuittee of Springfield. This
position she held for twelve years, helping to
inaugurate the modern and progressive methods
that have made Springfield schools prominent
in the State and country. Cooking, kinder-
gartens, suitable lunches at minimum cost for
high school scholars, were among the especial
objects of her attention, also the proper .sani-
tary conditions of the school-rooms for growing
children, including hygienic seats and desks,
])roper arrangement of light, cleanliness, and
school architecture.

In 1891 the organization of the Society of
the Daughters of the American Revolution
came to the notice of Mrs. Calkins through
a newspajjer item. She at once sought ilefi-
nite information concerning the society, and
in a few months became a member. On De-
cember 17 of the same year she was appointed
chapter regent for Springfield, the first aj)-
pointed in the State. On the 17th of June,
1892, she formally organized the first chapter
in the State, the Mercy Warren, with twenty-
three charter members. She retained the
regency until October, 1893, when the chapter
was well established with one hundred and
twenty-eight members. The pressure of other
duties now reijuired her retirement. In 1901
Mrs. Calkins again accepted the regency for



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



165



one year, and on lier resignation was made
honorary life regent.

The chapter early appointed a committee
to seek out the neglected and forgotten graves
of the Revolutionary soldiers of Springfield,
and ever since that time they have been marked.
Sixteen "real" daughters have been accepted
members of the chapter, and their lives made
brighter and in neeiled cases more comforta-
ble by the kindly offices of a standing com-
mittee appointed for the purpose. The chap-
ter has contributed to various patriotic objects,
including fifty dollars for the relief of the Cuban
reconcentrados; but in no direction has its
work been more gratifying than in the local
reawakening of a general interest in colonial
and Revolutionary history.

At the call of Governor Wolcott, May 3,
1898, upon the breaking out of the Spanish
War, for the formation of a State soldiers'
relief association, the chapter at once took
the lead in organizing a Springfield auxiliary,
and kept energetically to the work until the
receiving of the soldiers on their retuin home,
August 27. A memorial tablet to the Spring-
field soldiers, to be placed in the city library,
was the last act of the Springfielil auxiliary,
whose foremost officers were members of the
chapter.

In 1899 the chapter established ami furnished
at no inconsiderable expense headquarters for
its board of officers in connection with an
assembly hall. The whole number of mem-
bers enrolled is four hundretl and twenty-
three, and the present membership (April,
1904) is two hundred and seventy-five.

Mrs. Calkins was one of the board of man-
agers of the Springfield Soldiers' and Sailors'
Aid Society at the time of the Spanish War.

In 1895 the State primary school, through
the policy of the State to place its young wards
in families, had become so depleted that it
was abolished and the property turned over
to a board of trustees appointed by Governor
Wolcott for the establishment of a hospital
for epileptics. Mrs. Calkins was appointed
one of the trustees of the hospital, and is still
in its service.

Mrs. Calkins is a member of the Springfield
Women's Club, an honorary member of the



Teachers' Club, and a member of the Rama-
pogue Historical Society. Her church mem-
bership is with the First Congregational So-
ciety.



CORA DAY YOUNG, the matron of
the Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans'
Home in Xenia, and Past National
Senior Vice-President of the Wom-
an's Relief Corps, is a New England woman by
birth, parentage, and education. She was
born in Springvale, Me., March 26, 1847, her
parents soon after removing to Boston. She
was graduated from the Bowdoin School in
this city in July, 1863.

One of her great-great-grandfathers on the
maternal side was Colonel Jeremiah Moulton,
who was born in 1688 in York, Me. In 1692,
when he was four years old, he and his mother
were taken prisoners by the Indians, and she
was scalped. In 1724 he was oommantler at
the reduction of Norridgewock. Colonel Moul-
ton was rewai'ded with a silver tankard from
King George II. for valiant conduct at the siege
of Louisburg in 1745-47. He was afterward
High Sheriff of York County, Maine, one of
the Governor's Councillors, also Judge of the
Courts of Common Pleas and of Probate.

His son Jeremiah, Jr., was a Lieutenant
Colonel at L(niisburg; and his grandson, Jotham
Moulton, was a Colonel and later Brigadier-
general in the war of the Re^olution. He died
of camp fever at Ticonderoga.

The father of Mrs. Young was Albert Day,
M.D., a native of Wells, Me., ami a graduate
from the Harvard Medical School. For
manj' years he practised medicine in Boston
as a specialist of nervous diseases. He was a
lineal descendant of Anthony Day, who set-
tled in Gloucester, Mass., in 1645; and on his
mother's side was descended from the Storers
of colonial military distinction in Maine. In
1857 Dr. Day was a member of the lower branch
of the Massachusetts Legislature. He was al-
ways identified with philanthropic and jiatri-
otic movements. In Maine he was associated
with General Samuel Fessenden in the early
anti-slavery reform, and when a young man
he was a candidate on that ticket for treasurer



166



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



of York County. Dr. Day was likewise an
early supporter of the Washingtonian move-
ment, and probably was the first physician in
this country to treat methomania as a disease.
He was for thirty-six years (not consecutive)
the superintendent of the Washingtonian Home
in Boston. He died in April, 1894. This
home, which has a national reputation, was
organized in November, 1857, and in March,
1859, was incorporated by the State Legis-
lature, receiving a grant of five thousand dol-
lars. A new building on Waltham Street,
erected for the home, was dedicated December
20, 1873. Many thousand patients were under
the care of Dr. Day in the Washingtonian
Home. It has been estimated that one-third
of them were permanently cured, and more
than half the remainder benefited. Dr. Day
published a number of valuable works upon
this subject.

During the war of the Rebellion, Dr. Day,
as a member of the Boston School Board, as-
sisted in establishing the first school for "con-
trabands" or freedmen on this continent.

His son, Albert A. Day, in July, 1862, at the
age of seventeen, enlisted in the Forty-third
Regiment, Massachusetts ^^olunteers. He was
First Sergeant of Company K, and served in
the battle of Kinston and other engagements
in North Carolina. At the expiration of nine
months' term of service, " under an order is-
sued July 7 rendering it optional with the men
to go to the front or return home, two huntlred
and three officers and men voted to go to the
front" (Adjutant-general's report). Among
these was Sergeant Day. When he came home
at a later date, he brought with him a negro
boy about twelve years old, who had escapetl
from his master in North Carolina. The boy
lived in the family of Dr. Day for many years,
and was educated by the Doctor's daughter
Cora, Mrs. Young. He is now in the service
of Dr. Nichols, of Worcester. For several years
he contributed to the support of his former
mistress, a Mrs. Gregory, of ]']lizabeth City,
N.C., who was aged and in destitute circum-
stances.

At Wakefield, Mass., January 18, 1871,
Cora Day was married to Charles L. Yomig,
LL.D., of Buffalo, N.Y., a distinguished soldier



of the Civil AVar. His first service after being
a Zouave Cadet in April, 1861, was in the Ex-
celsior Brigade of New York under General
Daniel 10. Sickles. Throughout the Peninsu-
lar Camjxiign, A'iiginia, he served on the staff
of General Joseph Hooker. He was promoted,
and commanded his regiment during the sec-
ond Bull Run, Pope's campaign, including the
battles of Bristoe Station, Groveton, Bull Run
or Manassas, and Chantilly. At the battle
of Chancellorsville he was on the staff of Gen-
eral Sickles, in the Inspector-general's depart-
ment, with the rank of Major, and was desper-
ately wounded. With his wound unhealed,
he returned to the front, and was with Gen-
eral Sickles when the latter lost his leg at Get-
tysl)urg. He was again wounded in the Wil-
derness, then in the Inspector-general's de-
partment of General Winfiekl Scott Hancock.
He was the last in command of his regiment
in line of battle in the presence of the enemy.
After the war Major Young was brevetted
Lieutenant Colonel of Volunteers for meritori-
ous services during the Civil War.

After their marriage Colonel and Mrs. Young
resided in Toledo, Ohio. The Governor of Ohio
with the consent of the Senate appointed him
Quartermaster-general and Commissary-gen-
eral, with the rank of Brigadier-general. For
several years he has been superintendent of
the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home at
Xenia, Ohio. For nine years Mrs. Young has
been the matron of the Orphans' Home, which
is a State institution, and has nine hundred
pupils.

Mrs. Young was first secretary of the Board
of Trustees of the Home for Friendless Women
in Toledo, Ohio. She is a member of the Ur-
sula Wolcott Chapter, Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution, of Toledo, and of the Wom-
an's Club, of Xenia, Ohio.

Mrs. Young was among the earliest support-
ers of the Woman's Relief Corps, auxiliary
to the Grand Army of the Republic. She
was secretary and also president of the first
corps organized west of Massachusetts. As
Department Senior Vice-President, she twice
presided over the State Convention of Ohio,
and was elected to the second place of honor
in the national body, serving as National Sen-

ior Vice-President in 1886. Hor life has been
devoted to benevolent work, either in private
or public channels.

(Jeneral Young is a Past National Senior
Vice-Coinniander-in-chief of the Grand Army
of the Republic. He was for twelve years a
director of the Gettysburg Battlefield Memo-
rial Association. General and Mrs. Young are
not only appreciated for their ability and their
great philanthropic work, but are popular in
social life, and have many friends in all sec-
tions of the country. They have two children,
a son and a daughter. The former, Dr. Nel-
son Holland Young, is assistant suj^erintend-
ent and physician at the Ohio State Hospital
for the Insane, which is located at Toledo and
has seventeen hundreil patients. The daugh-
ter is Mrs. Eleanor M. Cunningham, of Brook-
lyn, N.Y.



LIS ABEL HEALD was born in Dex-
ter, Me., being the daughter of Otis
r, and Emeline Robinson Seavy Cutler.
Her father, moving to Portland in
1852, became the first appraiser at the port,
and was holding this office at the time of his
death, in May, 1868. He was a man of noble
character and excellent judgment, having mat-
ters of grave importance submitted to his de-
cision. His wife survived him many years,
dying in May, 1884.

Otis Cutler was of the seventh generation
of that branch of the Cutler family in New
England, whose immigrant progenitor, John
by name, died at Hingham, Mass., in February,
1638. It has been said that John Cutler, of
Hingham, Mass., came from the vicinity of
Norwich, England, in 1637 (see Morse) ; but
this has been questioned. The History of
Hingham, Genealogical, vol. ii., states that he
had land granted him tliere, on Broad Cove,
in 1635. From John' the line appears to have
descentied through Samuel,- Ebenezer,^ Eben-
ezer,^ Jonathan,'^ and Tarrant,'* to Otis,' born
in 1817 at Royalston, Mass.

From another English-born Cutler, Robert,'
of Charlestown, Mass., was descended the Rev.
Timothy Cutler, D.D., the first rector of Christ
Church, Boston, and "one of the first scholars



of his age in the colonies." Others of this name
in America have occupied high rank in the
clerical, legal, and medical professions.

An uncle of Mrs. Heald, General Lysander
Cutler, had an interesting career. Born in
Royalston, Mass., in 1807, he moved to Dex-
ter, Me., when a young man, engaged in busi-
ness as a woollen manufacturer, and became
the most eminent citizen of that place. Later
in life he removed to Milwaukee, Wis. En-
listing at the breaking out of the Civil War,
he was commissionetl Colonel of the Sixth Wis-
consin Regiment, served with great honor in
the Army of the Potomac, and was afterward
promoted to Major-general. He died in 1866.

Mrs. Heald's mother was a lovely character,
gentle and conscientious, dispensing words of
kindness and the quiet charities which shun
publicity. The family home being in Port-
land during Mrs. Heald's childhood and youth,
she was educated in the city schools. In the
year 1870 she married John Sumner Heakl,
claim adjuster of the Maine Central Railroad.
Mr. Healil is the granilson of the Hon. Mark
Langdon Hill, of Phippsburg, Me., one of the
early settlers, a prominent and wealthy man
in his day. It was in his family barouche that
General Lafayette was taken through the
streets of Portland when entertained there
during his visit to the United States of Amer-
ica in 1824-25. Mr. Hill's barouche was the
most elegant one at hand, and was loaned to
Portland for the occasion.

Always of a deeply religious turn of mind,
Mrs. Heald became when very young a mem-
ber of the Episcopal church. She has been a
student of creeds, autl has plunged into an-
cient and modern philosophy. She has stud-
ied science, theosophy, and the works of deep
thinkers of all ages, not for diversion, but to
find truth. Whatever her creed is to-day,
her rule of life is most emphatically, "Love thy
neighbor." She has the tenderest love and
sympathy for children, and has been a willing
helper in Sunday-schools. For a number of
years she has been active in charitable and
club work. It was she who was instrumental
in forming the Cumberland Relief Cure, an
organization which raised funds to send twenty-
five men to the Keely Cure, furnishing and



168

equipping a reading-room for them. Thougli
there were some disappointing features in this
labor, one bright particular case is so happy
in results that it seems ample reward for all
the effort put forth.

Mrs. Heald was for five years the efficient
president of the Beecher Club, whose study
was evolution; and she has been on the execu-
tive board of many of the well-known Portland
associations, including the Women's Literary
Union. At one time she belonged to fourteen
organizations. She is now State president of
the Maine division of the International Sun-
shine Society, an office that is no sinecure,
since she is usually called to write no less than
sixty letters a week. Attracted to the Sun-
shine columns in. the papers some time ago,
she took hold of the \.ork with such grasp that
she was .soon appointed its leader in Maine.
This .society is " not a charity, Init an inter-
change of kindly greetings and the passing on
of good cheer." There are about a hundred
and fifty daily and weekly papers reporting
"Sunshine" news. The society was founded
by Mrs. Cynthia Westover Alden in 1896. Its
object is to incite its members to the perform-
ance of kind and helpful deeds, and to thus
bring the sunshine of happiness into the great-
est possible number of hearts and homes. Its
active membership consists of people who are
desirous of brightening life by some thought,
word, or deed.

In a letter to the Journal the president-
general, Mrs. Cynthia Westover Alden, writes:
" Every week, regularly, your paper comes to
Sunshine head(|uarters, and we read it with
continued and renewed interest, especially
the Sunshine work in your State. I write now
to particularly thank you for your kindness,
and trust that you are going to continue lik-
ing us forever and ever.

"With your energetic president, Mrs. Heald,
of Portland, the State is becoming thoroughly
organized. In fact, it is the best organized
in Sunshine work of any State in the Union.
There are now two thousand and sixty-six
well-organized Sunshine branches reporting reg-
ularly, not counting the many branches that
are formed, but sent! in their reports irregu-
larly."



Mrs. Heald has incorporated the State of
Maine division of the International Sunshine
Society, and at this writing a petition to the
Legislature for an approjiriation for the ameli-
oration of the condition of the cripples in the
State is in preparation. Names of men and
women of influence have been secured, and it
is reasonably hoped that it will succeed. If
in the future attention is given these hopeless,
helpless sufferers, it will be due to her untiring
efforts in their behalf. Through her personal
efforts several cripples have already enjoyed
the services of a specialist. Her experience
ami observation have developed in an unusual
degree all that is tender and lovable in her nat-
ure. Her (juick sym{)athy with all suffering,
hoih physical and mental, renders her minis-
trations doubly sweet. Her heart and hands
are ready for all appeals for aid: to none is
.she indifTerent. She is eminently adapted to
be at the head of an organization who.se watch-
word is good cheer, for she is of pleasant ad-
ilress, and her greeting, even to the stranger,
is always warm-hearted and gracious.



GERTRUDE FRANKLIN SALIS-
BURY, better known to the mu.sical
world as Gertrude. Franklin and in
private life as Virginia Beatty Salis-
bury, is one of the most widely and favorably
known of Boston's vocal teachers. She was
born in Baltimore, Md., September 4, 1858,
and l)elongs to a wealthy and aristocratic
family. Her father, Mr. .lohn Beatty, of Balti-
mor(\ was the son of the late Mr. James Beatty,
an eminent merchant of Baltimore, who held
))Ositi()ns of great trust under President Madi-
.son. Her mother, Mrs. ElizalK'th Jackson
Beatty, was the daughter of the Rev. William
Jackson, a native of England. Among other
distinguished ancestors was her great-grand-
father, Gunning Bedford, who for a short time
in the Revolutionary War was aide-de-camp
to General .Washington. He represented Del-
aware in the Continental Congress, 1783 to
1786, and was a ])rominent member of the
convention that framed the Constitution of
the United States.

when she was four years old, and her early
schooling was receivetl in that city. Her
musical education began when she was a young
girl, and at the age of thirteen she gave prom-
ise of being a brilliant pianist. Her taste,
however, was for vocal music rather than in-
strumental, and, prompted by natural inclina-
tion and the possession of a voice of remarka-
ble sweetness and purity, she began to take
lessons in singing. Mr. Aaron Taylor and
Signor Agramonti were her first teachers, and
on the advice of the latter she went to Paris,
where she studied under Madame Lagrange
and with Professor Barbot of the Conserva-
toire. Before leaving Paris, Miss Franklin
appeared at a concert at the Salle l^.rard, and
achieved encouraging success, which was em-
phasized by immediate offers of concert en-
gagements and for a season of Italian opera.
These flattering offers she was, however, obligetl
to decline, as she hail made arrangements to
go to London. Here she studied with Shake-
speare and Alberto Randegger, the latter being
so pleased with h&lt;-r voice that he besought her
to remain and make a career in EngUyid. But
she had been too long absent from American
soil, and in her eagerness to return she declined
not only this offer but one to join Carl Rosa's
English Opera Company. On returning home
she took an extended course of study under
Madame Rudersdorff for oratorio and the
more serious range of classical concert music.
Miss Franklin has appeared in the sym-
phony concerts of Boston, New York, and
Brooklyn, and in classical and other concerts
in most of the large cities of the United States.
Her work has been under the leadership of
such men as Theodore Thomas, Wal* Dam-
rosch, Emil Paur, Karlberg, Ilenschei ricke,
Nikisch, Tomlins, antl Gilchrist. He icert
work was remarkable apart from her , 'oice
because of the extent of her reperto She

sings in French, German, Italian, and i;lish,
and has the proud distinction of lur the
largest repertoire of any American sin also
the largest collection of arias and c jstra
scores for the concert stage. Miss iklin

has never repeated a programme in tl .• ame
place, or an aria, unless called upon at a mo-
ment's notice to sing without rehearsal.



In April, 1896, Miss Franklin married Mr.
W. C. G. Salisbury, of Boston, and retired from
public life to devote her time to teaching. As
an instructor, she has been even more success-
ful than as a singer. Her pupils are on the oper-
atic, concert, and oratorio platform in Europe
and America.



SARAH JANE BOYDEN was born in
Chelsea, Ma.ss., July 17, 1842, the daugh-
ter of Darius Allen and Sarah Ann (Han-
son) Martin. When but six weeks old
she was deprived through death of a mother's
love and care, and, being a child of feeble health,
it was feared she would not live to maturity.
Her early education, obtained in the public
schools of Chelsea and Boston, was supple-
mented by a course of study in Bradford Acad-
emy at Bratlford, Mass., and in Captain Samuel
Hayden's private school in Braintree, Mass.

At the age of twenty she became the wife
of Robert Curtis Davidson, of Chelsea. Just
previous to their marriage Mr. Davidson had
enlisted in Company C, Thirty-fifth Massachu-
setts Regiment, to fight for the preservation
of the Union. After two years' service in the
army, he was wounded in the battle of Peters-
burg, July 30, 1864, and died at City Point,
Va., on the ISth of August following. In 1872
the subject of this sketch was again married,
her .second husband being Walter Willington
Boyden, of Roxbury. She is, the mother of
two daughters, Gertrude Louise, Edith Ferdi-
nand, and a son, Walter Allen.

From her father Mrs. Boyden inherited traits
of character which have made her steadfast
in purpose and firm in principle. Mr. Martin
hekl the position of State Constable for years,
and was noted for his courageous acts in closing
the saloons in Chelsea. Mrs. Boj'den's pastor,
the Rev. Dr. Albert H. Plumb, says of her: "I
have known Mrs. Boytien for some thirty years.
She is a living exemplification of the power to
do and of the wisdom of doing two things at
once, each being done better because the other
is also in hand. In her own home and in the
homes of the afflicted she has been a ministering
angel. In the family, the church, in charitable
and reformatory work, she has lived in all good



170

fidelity and zeal. In every sphere where she
has moved she has shown great energy and
administrative skill, a genial friendliness of
spirit, and a genuine love for everything good.
As one indication of the order of her house-
hold, I have learned that during fourteen years
of school life her daughter was never absent
or tardy, save one half-day, and never missed
a session of the Sunday-school in a still longer
period. 'I used to think,' said Will Carleton,
the poet, ' if my wife ever got to he a clul)
woman, I would not live with her — much of
the time. Since she has,' he added, 'I find
I value her more than ever before — what there
is of her.'

"To be at one's best, one needs to see each
duty in its relation to the whole problem of
life. For a person to become religious docs
not mean any vmdue withdrawal of time and
strength from any lines of laudable activity
previously enjoyed. Some such withdrawal
often conduces to desirable variety and there-
fore to efficiency. These considerations have
a special application to the vexed questions
concerning woman's sphere."

Naturally, a woman of so great executive
ability has been sought for as one of the leaders
among women. Mrs. Boyden is one of the
Board of Management of the Home for In-
temperate Women, president of the Woman's
Publishing Company, and treasurer of the
Suffolk Coimty Branch of the King's Daugh-
ters and Sons. Her chief work, however, is
as the efficient leader of the Ward and City
Committee of the Independent Women ^'oters,
of which she is president. This organization
has a deep interest in the welfare of the public
schools. It is thoroughly organized, and is a
power at every election. Mrs. Boyden's prov-
ince is to arrange for campaigns, instruct the
women in the twenty-five wards of Boston,
confer with kindred organizations and political
parties, and keep an outlook on all that concerns
the city schools, always working for theii- best
interests. Naturally diffident, it was with ex-
treme reluctance that she accepted the position
of president of so large an organization, but
experience has so enlarged her opportunities
for service that now she commands the forces
with skill, wisdom, and tact. She has en-



deared herself to the women she leads. Strong
in body, cheerful in temperament, cordial in
manner, loving in heart, in the prime of life, she
wields a potent influence in helping many of
her sisters to a higher life and into broader
paths of usefulness.

ADELAIDE E. BOOTHBY, the wife of
/\ Colonel Frederic E. Boothby, of Port-
_/ J^ land, Me., and one of the leading
women workers in various charitable
organizations of that city, is a native of ^^'ater-
ville. Me. Her parents were Charles and Vesta
B. Smith. As Adelaide Endora Smith she was
married to Frederic E. Boothby, October 25,
1871. Colonel Boothby was born in Norway,
Me. , being the son of Levi Thompson and Sophia
Packard (Brett) Boothby. In 1S57 the fam-
ily removetl to Waterville. For many years
Colonel Boothby has been an official of the
Maine Central Railroad. His title comes from
his service on the staff of Governors Bodwell,
Marble, and Burleigh, six years in all. He was
president of the Portland Board of Trade for
five years, was elected Mayor of the city in
the spring of 1901, and is now (autumn of 1903)
serving his third term in that office. With
the exception of a three years' residence in
Augusta, Colonel and Mrs. Boothby have livetl
in Portland, their pleasant rooms at the Fal-
mouth House being a hospitable social centre.

Possessing an unusually sympathetic dispo-
sition, Mrs. Boothby has proved a ready lis-
tener and a willing helper to many who have
applied to her for aid and encouragement. She
has held offices of responsibility in the Invalids'
Home, the Temporary Home for Women and
Children, the Home for Friendless Boys, and
auxiliaries to the Young Men's Christian Asso-
ciation. Even in her social life she has remem-
bered the claims of charity and philanthropy,
and has caused the proceeds of whist parties
and merry-makings to go toward the allevia-
tion of suffering. ^Irs. Boothliy has been espe-
cially interested in the work for the girls of
the Temporary Home, of which she is a prac-
tical and thoughtful officer.

Conspicuous among her energetic labors is



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



171



her service as president of the Civic Club,
which vk^as founded in May, 1898, by Mrs. Etta
H. Osgood. Its object is " to promote by e&lt;Ui-
cation and active co-operation a higher jxibiic
hfe and a better social order." One of its
principles is a belief in the trinity of health —
pure food, pure air, antl pure water. The
watchword of the club is, " Duties assigned
cheerfully assumed." Aijplications for mem-
bership are carefully considered, and only those
who are willing to perform some service in be-
half of its objects ai'e welcomed as members.

The club has laid out playgrounds at the
North School in Portland, has been instrumental
in procuring the ordinance prohibiting expec-
toration, and secured the placing of rul)l)ish
buckets on the streets. It has also secured an
appropriation for public baths and for milk
inspection. Its power for good is appreciated
by the citizens of Portland, and its valuable
W(jrk will receive their earnest sup]&gt;ort.

\Mien, several years ago, Professoi- Chapman
was making strenuous efforts to establish the
Maine .Musical Festival, Mrs. Booth))y entered
heartily hito his plans. At a time when failure
seemed inevitable, she was one of the stanch
supporters of this ]iroject, which has given to
the State such rare musical pi'ivileges.

Mrs. Boothby's private charities are legion
and vmknown. As the wife of the Mayor she
extemls cordial good will antl ready welcome
to all. As an officer of various organizations
she is faithful and efficient. As a citizen .she
is valued for her generous sympathies and for
her support of all matters of public interest.

When a citizen of Maine said, " I am sure
Portland is written on the hearts of Mayor
Boothby and his wife, they have always so
laiiored for the good of the city," he expre.ssed
a .sentiment that is endorsed by all good people
within its borders.



MARY PARKS PUTNAM, M.D., was
born April 28, 1841, in Charlestown,
N.H., known at the time of its set-
tlement as Township No. 4. She is
the eldest of the three daughters of the late
David Whipple and Jane (Ellison) Parks, and
is of English descent. The ancestral kin on



the paternal side includes physicians, lawyers,
and teachers, beside several persons who were
highly skilled in trades. Her father was a sol-
dier of the Civil War in the sixties of the nine-
teenth century, and did his full share toward
the preservation of the Union.

Having an inherent love for study and in-
vestigation. Dr. Putnam's professional career
was early foreshadowed. When barely fifteen
years of age she became a teacher under the
old district-school system in her native town
and its vicinity. Such was her success that
her services were in constant demand, and she
made the record of fifty-three consecutive
terms in the same school-room. Wliile pur-
suing this vocation, she began the study of medi-
cine, reading extensively by herself and then
taking a three years' course in a school well-
known at that time. Later entering the Col-
lege of Physicians and Surgeons in Boston,
she devoted three more years to study, and was
graduated at the age of fifty-three. She inmie-
diately opened her office in one of the best
resitlential districts of Boston, where her prac-
tice has steadily increased and become firmly
established.

Doctor Putnam has always been ready to ex-
tend a helping hand to young women anil girls.
To one she gave the protection of her home
and the same education and liberal training
that she bestowed upon her own daughter,
antl to many another has she given encourage-
ment and opportunity to gain higher education
and development. She is interested in training-
schools for imr.ses in Boston and elsewhere, also
in nimierous philanthropic, educational, anil
charitable movements. Needless to say, she
has a large circle of friends. In the progress of
modern science she keeps well posted, particu-
larly on all lines relating to her chosen work.

She married during her .service as school-
teacher Mr. Wesley D. Putnam, of her native
town. For many years Mr. Putnam has been
connected with one of the leading manufactur-
ing houses in Massachusetts. He has always
given his hearty sympathy and encouragement
to his wife in the attainment of her professional
ambition, and their home on Commonwealth
Avenue has been a happy one, its sole shadow
having been the death of their only child, a

beautiful and accomplished young lady, wife
of one of the rising young business men of
Boston.



JESSIE ELDRIDGE SOUTHWICK, one of
the faculty of the Emerson College of
Oratory and an interpreter of Shake-
speare's plays, is a native of Wilmington,
Del. Her father, Issachar Eldridge, descended
from the Quaker Eldridges of Philadelphia.
Her mother, whose maitlen name was Martha
Gause, was from Chester County, Pennsylva-
nia. She was related to a number of leading
teachers and writers. Bayard Taylor, the noted
traveller and author, being a near kinsman. To
her maternal ancestors Mrs. Southwick is prob-
ably indebted for her marked literary talents.
When Jessie Eldridge was five years old, her
parents removed to Van Wert, Ohio, where her
childhood days were spent. Her mother was
her first teacher, her early lessons being learned
at home. She afterward pursued her studies
successively at the high school and at Glendale
Female College, near Cincinnati, and at the
age of fifteen, under a private tutor, completetl
her preparation for Vassar College. Changing
her plans, however, she came to Boston be-
cause of the better advantages here aiTorded
for the study of music and elocution, and en-
tered the New England Conservatory of Music.
Devoting herself esjiecialiy to oratory, for which
she seemed well adapted, she was graduated
from that department in 1883. While studying
at the Conservatory, she also attended Miss
Johnson's private school on Newbury Street,
Boston. To further qualify herself for the pro-
fession of oratory, she continued her studies at
the Monroe Conservatory (now the Emerson
College of Oratory). She was graduated there
in 1885, and then took a post-graduate course
of two years, during which time she assisted in
teaching. For a while she was an assistant
to Miss Mary A. Currier in the department of
oratory at Wellesley College, but that position
she was obliged to give up at length on account
of the increasing demands on her time for public
work. She had made a specialty of Shake-
speare's plays, and her intelligent interpretation,
with her fine stage presence and well-modulated



voice, has since won her a wide-spread reputa-
tion, her readings being in demand in various
parts of the country.

In 1889 Jessie Eldridge married Henry Law-
rence Southwick, a graduate of the college, then
teaching in Philadelphia. Mr. Southwick be-
came the following year a partner of Dr. C. W.
Emerson in th" Fm^rson Cr^'lo^e, nnd remained
there until 1897, Mrs. Southwick, as one of the
faculty, having charge of the classes in voice
culture, dramatic interpretation, and the ren-
dering of Shakespeare. Mr. and Mrs. South-
wick have conducted summer schools at Glens
Falls, N.Y., Cottage City, Martha's Vineyard,
and at several places in Virginia, as well as in
Boston.

In June, 1900, Dean Southwick purchased
Dr. Emerson's share in the college and took
the full management, Dr. Emerson remaining
as President and lecturer in his individual
work. Since assuming the management Dean
Southwick has made many changes and adtled
numerous courses. The Emerson College of
Oratory stands to-day as the largest institution
of its kind in the world. Established in 1880
as a private school by Charles Wesley Emerson,
in September, 1886, it was formally incorpo-
rated under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts as the Monroe College of Ora-
tory, being named in honor of the late Professor
Lewis B. Monroe. LIpon petition to the Legis-
lature in 1890, a bill was passed authorizing
the change of name to Emerson College of Ora-
tory.

This college is a school for personal culture.
It aims to awaken in the student of expression,
whether he be a creative thinker or an inter-
preter, a realization of his own potentialities,
and to give such direction to his training that
he may attain them. While conserving the
best traditions of the past, the college aims to
stand for thorough investigation, the mo^t ad-
vanced educational methods, and the highest
professional standards and ideals.

In 1900 the college was moved into elegant
(juarters at Chickering Hall, one of the hand-
somest and best appointed of Boston's new
buildings. Situated on Huntington Avenue
near the corner of Massachusetts Avenue, it is
easily accessible from all railroads leading into

the city, and cars to all points pass close to its
doors. Within five minutes' walk of the Fens,
within eight minutes of the Public Library ancl
the Museum of Fine Arts, and close beside
the new Symphony Hall and beautiful new
hall of the Horticultural Society, the college
home is in the artistic and literary centre of
Boston.

Mrs. Southwick has been connected with the
college as either pupil or teacher almost since
its inception, and to her faithful and efficient
work in conjunction with her husband is at-
tributed much of its success and growth. As
a reader and especially as a Shakespearean ex-
ponent, she is well known to literary American
audiences as a leading artist. Her dramatic
power and personal magnetism hold her audi-
ences almost spellbound. The series of recitals
given every season under the direction of Dean
and Mrs. Southwick have become a marked
feature of literary Boston, as is shown by the
large audiences in attendance. Mrs. South-
wick is also a power in the social element of
the college life, where she takes a personal
interest in all the receptions given, and comes
in contact with all of the pupils of the
school.

Mr. and Mrs. Southwick have three children,
namely: Ruth, born September 18, 1893; Mil-
dred, born August 15, 1895; and Jessie, born
November 18, 1897 — all of whom are now re-
ceiving the best educational advantages that
can be secured.



HANNAH E. AND JULIA R. OILMAN,
the principals of the Home and Day
School for Girls at 324 Conunon-
wealth Avenue, Boston, belong to a
family which for many generations has mani-
fested a marked interest in all matters pertain-
ing to Christian education. Their genealog-
ical tree shows New England stock of the best
quality. In one branch appears the name of
Daniel C. Oilman, the first President of Johns
Hopkins Lhii versify and now at the head of the
Carnegie Institution, \A'ashiiigton, D.C. In
anothei- branch is found the name of Arthur
Oilman, of Cambridge, formerly regent of Rad-
cliffe College.



The Rev. Tristram Oilman (Harv. Coll.
1757) gi'eat-grandfather of the Misses Oilman
of Boston, was the honored and beloved pastor
of the First Church in North Yarmouth, Me.,
for forty vears, or from the date of his ortlina-
tion in 1769 until his death in 1809. Their
grandfather, .Iosei)h Oilman, who was an emi-
nent physician in Wells, Me., was a stanch ad-
vocate of education, good citizenship, and every
form of philanthropy. A more distant for-
bear, the Rev. Nicholas Oilman, A.M. (Harv.
Coll. 1724), father of Tristram, had the same
qualities of firm principle, sound judgment,
and strong sense of duty which have "run in
the family," as the phrase goes, from the be-
ginning. The men were more ambitious to
be useful members of society than to acquire
either fame or fortune, and they were distin-
guished for their quiet home virtues.

The subjects of this sketch were born in Fox-
croft, Me., being the daughters of EbenezoT
and Roxana (Palmer) Gilman. The parents
had high ideals for their children, eight in all,
and together they trained the boys and girls
in habits of industry, thrift, self-control, and
a genuine religious faith. The father was a
man of unusual sweetness and purity of char-
acter. The mother, like so many New Eng-
land women of that period, had a practical
wistlom and energv which beautifully com-
plemented her husbaml's gentle traits. Both
believed in the value of a good education, for
daughters equally with sons, and labored cheer-
full)' to secure for their large family such ad-
vantages as the times afforded.

The elder of these two sisters, Hannah,
studied first at the Foxcroft Academy and
late]- at Bradford Seminary, being graduated
in 1857. From this time onward she devoted
herself assiduously to study, not for the sake
of mere accomplishment or mental exercise,
but with an earnest purpose to embody in her
life the spirit expressed in Whittier's lines,

" Make the world within your reach
Somewhat the better for your living,
And gladder for your human speech."

Her love of culture was inborn, and the whole-
some discipline of Puritan training gave her



174

large capacity for work. To these traits were
added soundness of jndgment, strength of will,
cheerfulness, unselfishness, and deep and un-
affected piety. Thus it will be seen that she
had the qualifications of the ideal teacher, and
naturally she was soon sought for by the best
private schools in New Elngland, having first
served an apprenticeshij) in the ])ublic schools.
ICverywhere she met with signal success. In
the autumn of 1884 she opened the now well-
known Gilman School, which rapidly outgrew
its original quarters, and in 1890 was trans-
ferred to its present location, 324 Common-
wealth Avenue.

In this work she was ably assisted by her
sister Julia, who resigned a position in the
Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School
for the Blind, South Boston, where she had
taught for nine years, in order to engage in
this larger service. She, too, had studied at
the Foxcroft Academy, also with her aunt.
Miss Rebecca I. Gilman, who for many years
was principal of a large private school in Boston.
It is interesting to note how strongly marked
is the predilection for teaching in the various
branches of this family.

Both sisters have given substantial proof
of their attachment to the place where they
received their early education bj' the assistance
which they have lately rendered to the trustees
of P'oxcroft Academy in raising an endowment
fund for that institution. Evidence of the
hold of these women upon the affection of their
former pupils is seen in the fact that, when they
solicited the money from this particular circle
of friends, girls who had lio personal interest
in the small village in Maine, the letters which
came in reply to their appeal for gifts were full
of love and loyalty.

To the strong influence for good which they
exerted upon their pujjils another testimonial,
among hundreds which might be adduced,
appears in this extract from a letter, dated
March, 1903, written to Miss Julia Gilman by
Mary Chandler Lowell, i)erhaps the only young
woman in America who has taken a tlegree in
both medicine and law: "The other morning,
when I stood in the court room and took the
solemn oath of office of an attorney at law, my
mind turned toward you. ... It was my good



fortune in early youth to have several excel-
lent teachers, but I think that none played
so important a part in moulding my character
and inspiring within me a desire to press for-
ward and make the most of my abilities as did
you. . . . But for your W"ords of encouragement
and cheer I might never have been al)le to
hold, as I do to-day, certificates which entitle
me to the privileges of both the medical and
the legal profession."

Such letters give an insight into the motives
which control these teachers. When Mi.ss
Julia Gilman left South Boston, Mr. Anagnos,
the director, jiaid a high tribute to her as "one
of the most efficient and conscientious teachers
ever emploj^ed by the Institution," and laid
special emphasis on the way she had helped to
"enlarge its ethical atmosphere to a very grati-
fying extent."

In this last sentence is revealed the secret
of their power. Neither of the sisters could
ever be satisfied simply to impart instruction.
The ethical has been the dominant note in their
teaching. Their aim is to provide "a home
life which shall secure the development of true
womanhood." As one means to this end they
have secured as lecturers at the school from
year to year men and women who are eminent
in various walks of life, and who, in particular,
are exponents of the finest Christian ideals.
Among re])resentative women they have ha&lt;l
Julia Ward Howe, Mary A. Livermore, Amelia
Quinton, Lillian Nordica, Mary E. Wilkins,
Amelia E. Barr, and Pundita Ramabai. The
list of lecturers of the other sex includes many
prominent clergymen, artists, and authors.

The Home and Day School of the Misses
Gilman stands to-day as a witness to the value
of jjersonaiity as a factor in the education of
youth. With the old Phrygian philosopher,
]']pictetus, these women have felt that " the
formation of the spirit and character must be
our real concern," and this is the basic prin-
ciple of their school. Its success demonstrates
the truth of Emerson's words: "In my dealing
with .my child, my Latin and my Greek,
my accomplishments and my money, stead
me nothing ; but as much soul as I have
avails."

HARRIETTE J. COOKE, superintend-
ent of Medical Mission, 36 Hull
Street, Boston, Mass., is a native
of New Hampshire. She was born
in the town of Sandwich, Carroll County,
in the central part of the State, December 1,
1829, daughter of Josiah and Jane (Cox)
Cooke. Her father was of the third genera-
tion of his family to reside in Sandwich, being
a son of Joel Cooke and grandson of Cornelius
Cooke, an early settler in that locality, men
characterized by sincerity, uprightness, and
simplicity of life.

Harriette Cooke early imbibed the belief
that a thorough education was the greatest
of helps to a life of usefulness. As there
were no colleges open to women in those days,
she was obliged to gather what learning she
could from the various schools and seminaries
accessible to her and from private instruction.
In 1853 she was graduated at the New Hamp-
shire Conference Seminary, now Tilton Sem-
inary. After a few years of successful teaching
in Massachusetts she accepted a position
as teacher in Cornell College, Mount Vernon,
Iowa, which she entered in November, 1857,
its opening year. She was then a young
woman, possessing an ambition to excel in
whatever she undertook to do. Her charac-
ter was well adapted to pioneer educational
work, having in it the decidedly marked
combination of strength and tender womanly
sympathy. She was fully up to the times
as regarded methods of instruction and mental
discipline.

She had especially had stampetl on her
soul — as if by divine impress — a desire to
assist in the higher education of woman. A
profound conviction that only by intellectual
and moral culture can the world be raised
from the degrading influences of ignorance,
and that this end can be best attained through
the home by the elevation of woman, rendered
her conscious of the importance of her high
calling. She thus brought to her new field
of labor an enthusiasm which was immediately
recognized. Being unusually rigid in her re-
quirements of work from her pupils, she gained
a reputation for over-exactness that for a
time was not altogether conducive to mere



popularity. But with all their unfavorable
criticisms, among thinking students she soon
commanded the highest respect. In 1886
Miss Cooke was made preceptress of the college
and in 1872 professor of German and history,
the latter appointment being, it is said, the
first honor of the kind conferred upon a woman
in the I'nitcd States. These departments
of the college she built up and establishetl
on a firm foundation. In 1886 she was re-
lieved of the German and made professor of
history anil the science of government. Granted
leave of absence in 1872, she spent the year
in Great Britain and on the Continent, avail-
ing herself of the advantages given by the
London University for the study of history
and literature, also increasing her knowledge
of the German language by the assistance
of native teachers. She continued her work
at Coi'iiell College until 1890.

This brief account of the educational career
of Professor Harriette J. Cooke, together
with the following appreciation of her work
and character, is gathered from a sketch
written for the College Year Book' for 1890
by a former pupil and lifelong friend, namely,
Mrs. Collin, wife of Alonzo Collin, the senior
professor of Cornell College.

Miss Cooke has given special attention to
the moral and religious training of the hvmdreds
of young ladies who have been placed under
her immediate charge. Many of them testify
that her strong appeals to the noblest powers
of their being were among their chief incen-
tives in trying to develop themselves into
the highest types of true womanhood. She
had a realizing sense of the great responsibility
resting upon her, a feeling that none can
know but those who have consecrated them-
selves to lives of self-sacrifice for the good
of others. Possessed of an active mind and
a physical organization that seems never to
have known weariness, she has endured un-
ceasing toil for years, having in all her college
life lost but one term, and this because of a
serious injury occasioned by a fall. With
a spirit of unselfishness and a great capacity
to endure, she has generally done the work
of two.

Miss Cooke is a very pleasing public speaker,



176



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



having frequently used her talents in this
direction for the benefit of her college and
other philanthropic objects. She is a strong,
terse writer, with an interesting style, as is
often shown by class lectures and papers
read before literary and other organizations.
She has been a zealous student and a constant
and .successful teacher of the Bible. This
inspired volume has given her much of the
wonderful faith, hope, and love she has in
and for humanity. She is well informed on
the affairs of state and the science of business
relations. In the sick-room she has shown
herself unusually skilful as a nurse. Fortunate
are they who have her name upon tlieir list
of friends. Fearless and faithful, she will
be to them loyal and true, cheerful and kind.
Soon after leaving Cornell College, Miss
Cooke went to England for the purpose of
studying Christian work as carried on by
Mildmay in North London. This great mission
was the first attempt on a large scale to carry
on reformatory work in the slums of a great
city by workers living among the crowded
population. During the winter of 1872, when
Miss Cooke was making some research in
history at University College, London, her
attention was attracted to this work, which,
by its unusual methods and by the high rank
of those engaged in it, excited great interest
in the city. Indirectly it \yas the outgrowth
of the plague which made such havoc in the
congested section of East London during the
years 1865-66. It was impossible to care for
the dying or to bury the dead, for sometimes
whole families were taken sick in one house.
At this crisis Mr. and Mrs. Pennefather, with
a band of women from the upper class of society,
offered to assist the clergyman at Bethnal
Green in that centre of the plague. These
women, six in number, began their labor of
love by opening an old warehouse as a home
for themselves and as a centre of distribution
of such help as they could give. They pre-
pared suitable food, gathered such things as
they might need — drugs, disinfectants, clean
linen, and so forth — and began their visits
to the homes. With nutritious food, comforts
of every kind, and words of love they cheered
the sick, comforted the dying, read the Bible,



and made the rooms they visited clean and
tidy. They went to the city magistrate,
and pleaded for better sanitary conditions.
When the i)lague under their vigorous measures
began to abate, they did not cease their work.
They established a permanent home in the
dark section, the worst in London. It was
really the first "settlement" in any slum,
though not so called. They began industrial
work and established educational classes, Eng-
land at this time (1867) having no system of
free public schools. Their night school was soon
crowded with men of all ages and conditions.
They gathered the street boys into bright,
warm rooms, and organized them into clubs.

One lady belonging to the cultured class
went into the "thieves' quarters," working
and teaching there for years. Through her
loving faithfulness hundreds were rescued from
lives of shame, aiul became upright citizens.
One whom Miss Cooke knew became a lay
preacher, whose effective work rescued many.
Men's clubs were opened, mothers' meetings
held, coffee rooms establisheil; and lodging-
houses, clean and well kept, took the place
of the "dens" that had been "dens of thieves."
The gospel service was held in the waiting-
room. 'Trained nurses visited in the homes,
ministering to their inmates; and Christian
doctors gave their services. A marvellous
change was wrought in a few years. The
number of workers was constantly increased,
and twenty-four stations were established in
the worst parts of London, managed by the
Mildmay workers. When Miss Cooke went
there in 1890, these women were ministering
to one hundred thousand of London's poor.
They had several well-equipped hospitals, four
medical missions, convalescent, women's, and
orphans' asylums.

In such a practical school of methods Miss
Cooke took her three years' course, in 1892
having charge of the night study classes. Work-
ing in every department, she learned lessons
that are now bearing fruit. In the spring of
1893 she accepted an invitation to enter the
Hull Street settlement, Boston, which had
iieen started the preceding January by students
of Boston University, among them the Rev.
Rollin H. Walker and the Rev. Edgar Helms

and his sainti'd wife, who brought to this
work a consecration which has left an impress
for permanent good. Another member of
the settlement was Miranda Croucher, who
showed such heroic courage during the Boxer
massacres in China.

Miss Cooke took an interest in the entire
work of the settlement, which is of an all-round
character; but the part that owes its origin
to her is the medical mission, which was her
special charge under difficulties that would
have discouraged a less experienced worker.
This work — the founding of the medical mission
in connection with the university settlement
at 36 Hull Street — is the crowning work of
Miss Cooke's long and busy life. It is the
first medical mission established in New Eng-
land, and the settlement is the only one, so
far as we know, which has this ilepartment
connectetl with it. It may here be best de-
seribeil in Miss Cooke's own words : " Its aim
is far different from a free dispensary. It
cannot be denied that New England Ls rapidly
becoming foreign missionary ground. It is
therefore fitting that the best agencies should
be usetl to bring this foreign population into
sympathy antl in touch with American civiliza-
tion and American ideas of education.

" Through ministry to suffering, as well as
by educational efforts, an effectual door was
opened to the hearts and homes of these stran-
gers, who are coming in such numbers to
stay with us. Many of them are exposed to
imposition and neglect, and are helpless to
meet these conditions. By helping them when
sick and unable to get work, they are ready
to adopt better methods of living, and the
children offer the best opportunity for making
these people American. These little ones are
bright and alert, and, taken into new environ-
ments, they readily adapt themselves to new
conditions. Thousands of these chiklren are
crowded together in the tenements of our cities,
and if we neglect them we shall bring upon
ourselves the blame of the bad government of
our cities, which these children will surely rule
in a few years. By all means in our power,
now is the time to make good Americans of
them and then good loyal citizens, whose
right to vote can neither be bought nor sold.



To do this we nmst get into close touch with
the home life, and so get a firm hold upon
these children and young i)eople. Ten years
of this close work in the homes of these people,
in sympathetic and friendly association, is
already showing the very best results. A
large class of young people are already taking
an intelligent interest in everything that per-
tains to the public interest of the North End.
Young men and young women are seeking to
do for the neighborhood what will be a powerful
influence in the right direction. Many are
studying to etjuip themselves for a useful and
helpful life.

"The work brings its own reward; and, if
any doubt that such methods are practical,
let them spend a few days at 36 HuH Street,
and see the varied plans and the all-round
efforts to win the young people to adopt the
best and become the best. There is a hearty
co-operation among the many workers of this
important part of the city with the excellent
public schools and different institutions to
make this the centre of a new and a renewed
life for Boston."



LYDIA GROUT WELLINGTON, a mem-
ber of .the Ladies' Aid Association of .
_^ the Massachusetts Soldiers' Home in
Chelsea, is a resilient of Worcester.
She was born December 1, 1844, daughter of
Edw-in and Lydia Pierce (Barton) Grout, of
Millbury, Mass.

On the paternal side she is a direct descend-
ant in the seventh generation of John' Grout,
one of the early proprietors of Watertown.
About the year 1643 John' Grout removed to
Sudbury, lie served as Captain of a military
company and as a chirurgeon.

Jonathan^ Grout, born in Sudbury in 1658
(son of Captain John by his second wife, Sarah,
daughter oj' Nicholas Busby and widow of
Captain Thomas Cakcbread), married Abigail,
daughter of John Dix.

Jonathan,' their son, born in 1702, married
Hannah Hurd. He bought a farm in Worces-
ter about 1744, and died there in 1748. Jona-
than,^ born in Sudbury, 1744, also resided in
Worcester.

Jonathan,'^ born 1772, son of Jonathan^ and
his wife Anna, married Sally DeWolf, of Lyme,
Conn., doubtless a descendant of Balthasar De
Wolf, an early settler of the town. Jonathan
Grout, known as Master Grout, long a success-
ful teacher of district schools, was also a book-
binder and bookseller, and publisher of several
small devotional books.

His son Edwin," born in 1812, died in 1846.
He married in 1836 Lydia P. Barton. Their
daughter, Lydia Ann (now Mrs. Wellington),
whose birth date is given above, was educated
at the Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Mass. On
September 18, 1866, she was married to Gen-
eral Arthur Augustus Goodell, of Worcester, a
veteran of the Civil War. She became the
mother of four children: Harry Barton, born
August 13, 1867; Edwin Wilder, born March
15, 1869, who died February 4, 1890; Alice
May, born May 1, 1871; and Edwin Howe, born
February 8, 1873, who died in infancy. Gen-
eral Goodell died June 30, 1882, on the forty-
third anniversary of his birth. The following
is his military record: "Sergeant Major, Third
Battalion Rifles, M. V. M., April 19, 1861; Ad-
jutant, July 1, 1861 ; Captain Company C, Thirty-
sixth Massachusetts Volunteers, August 16, 1862;
Major, January 29, 1863; Lieutenant Colonel,
July 31, 1863, commanding regiment from
that date until October 10, 1863, when severely
wounded at Blue Springs, Tenn. ; returned to
regiment April 1, 1864; resigned May 5 in con-
.sequence of disability resulting from wounds.
Brevetted Brigadier-general, United States
Volunteers, for 'gallant and meritorious con-
duct in the field during the war.' "

On September 4, 1883, Mrs. Goodell became
the wife of Fred Williams Wellington, who in
former years had been connected in business
with General Goodell. Mr. Wellington was
born in Shirley, Mass., May 31, 1851, son of
Timothy W. and Augusta (Fiske) Wellington
and a lineal descendant in the eighth genera-
tion of Roger Wellington, one of the early
proprietors of Watertown, Mass. He was edu-
cated in the public schools of Worcester (his
parents having removed to that city in 1855)
and in schools in Germany and France, where
he spent two years. One year after his return
from Europe he was clerk in the First National



Bank, Worcester, and later he was in his
father's coal office. The year 1871 he passed
in California. He embarked in the coal busi-
ness in 1872, anil is still in the trade, having
been since 1889 president and general manager
of the Austin C. Wellington Coal Company.
Commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Massa-
chusetts Volunteer Militia in 1882, he was suc-
cessively promoted to First Lieutenant, Captain,
and Assistant Inspector-general on the staff of
Governor Ames, with rank of Colonel. He
served on the staff of Governors Greenhalge,
Wolcott, and Crane, and is now (1903) on the
staff of Governor Bates with rank of Brigadier-
general.

Greatly interested in the welfare of the Civil
War veterans, comrades of the Grand Army
of the Republic, Mrs. Wellington has long
been an earnest worker in the Ladies' Aid
Society of the Soldiers' Home in Chelsea. She
is also an active and esteemed :ii mber of the
Woman's Club of Worcester.



A NN MARIA MILES SPRAGUE, edu-
/ \ cator and philanthropist, is a sister
X ^ of General Nelson A. Miles and a
descendant of the Rev. John Myles,
who came to New England about the year
1663 from Swansea, Wales, and settled in
Swansea, Mass., so named at the incorpora-
tion of the town a few years later. His
death is thus recorded: "Mr. John Myles,
pastor of the church in Swanzy, deceased
February 3, 1682-3." His son, John Myles,
Jr., who also resided in Swansea, Mass., was
elected to the office of Town Clerk in May,
1670. Nathaniel, son of John Myles, Jr.,
was born, as recorded in the Swansea town
register, 26th day, 8 mo., 1671; and James,
son of John the younger and Mary, his wife,
in April, 1674. Daniel Miles, a native of
Pomfret, Conn., thought to have been of the
fourth generation of this family, and son
of a Samuel Miles, removed to Petersham,
Mass., where he died early in 1777, his will
being probated April 9. His .son, Joab Miles,
died in Petersham in 1835 at the age of ninety-
one years. Joab married Elizabeth Fitch,
a descendant, it is said, of John Fitch, who



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



179



was captured by the Indians at Fitchburg,
and from whom that city derived its name.
A tablet to the memory of John Fitch may
now be seen in Fitciiburg. Daniel Miles,
born in Petersham in 1799, son of Joab, married
Mary Curtis, of ^^'estminster, who was born
in 1802. Both died in 1875. Daniel and
Mary (Curtis) Miles had four children — namely,
Daniel Curtis, Mary Jane, Ann Maria, and
Nelson Appleton. The last named, in his
interesting book, " Personal Recollections of
General Nelson A. Miles," refers to his parents
and ancestors as follows: —

" Physical and mental advantages were not
the only ones for which 1 feel it a very pleasant
iluty to render thanks to my honored parents.
Simplicity of life, purity of thought and action,
and high moral standartls were as character-
istic of them as of their ancestors through
many generations. My father, Daniel Miles,
excelled in strength, resolution, boldness, antl
the highest sense of honor. To the example
of his sterling integrity, spotless character,
and loyalty to country I owe whatever of
aptitude I have possessed in meeting the
stern realities of a somewhat tumultuous
life in an exacting profession. My father's
high qualities had been transmitted through
five generations from the Rev. John Miles,
a Welsh clergyman, who hail not only been
a soldier of the Cross, but also a soldier of
approved valor and conduct in the Indian
wars.

" For many years he carried on a school
'for the teaching of granmiar and arithmetic,
and the tongues of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew,
also how to read English and to write.' This
ancestor's residence was strongly built, and
when King Philip's War broke out, in 1675,
it was fortified and became known as Myles's
Garrison. There the colonial forces gathered
at the first outbreak of Indian hostilities, anil
the pastor became foremost in the defence of
the settlement anil was chosen Captain. Having
done valiant service in the war, he at the
close resumed the duties of a country clergy-
man.

"His son Samuel graduated from Harvard
College in 1684, and went to England soon
after, where he took orders in the English



church. Returning to Boston, Samuel Mdes
became rector of King's Chapel in 1689, con-
tinuing in this position for twenty-nine years.
Oxfoid L'niversity conferred upon him the
degree of Master of Arts in 1693.

" My ancestors moved from Massachusetts
to Pomfret, Conn. Thence they made a settle-
ment at what is now the town of Petersham,
in Central Massachusetts, when that was the
extreme frontier. This settlement was at
once abandoned because of the depredations
of the Indians.

" My paternal grandfather, Joab, and great-
grandfather, Daniel, were both soldiers of the
Revolution.

[In " Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors
of the Revolutionary War," vol. x., the record
of Joab Miles is as follows: "Sergeant, Capt.
Wing Spooner's Co., Col. Nathan Sparhawk's
regt.; engaged Aug. 21, 1777, travel to camp
and home 180 miles; service at twenty miles
per day, 9 days; company marched from
Petersham to Bennington, Aug. 21, 1777,
to reinforce army under General Stark; also,
1st Sergeant, Capt. Josiah AVilder's company.
Col. Nathan Sparhawk's regt., commanded
by Maj. Daniel Clap, entereil service July 4,
1778: discharged July 15, 1778; service 13 days
at Rutland Barracks, company raised for 20
days' service; roll dated Templeton."

■The records of Daniel Miles in the same
volume, beginning with service from August 3,
1776, and ending with discharge in December,
1780, cannot all refer to Joab's father, who
died, as above noted, in 1777.]

"I have often heard my father tell of the
experiences of his father and grandfather —
of their sudden departure for the field and
of the hardships encountered by them and
their comrades.

"My father, Daniel Miles, was born in Peters-
ham, but moved in early life to Westminster,
in the same county [Worcester], in the State
of Massachusetts, where he engaged in farming
and in the lumber business."

In referring to their mother General Miles
says: "My mother, Mary Curtis, possessed
traits of character similar to those of my
father, and excelled in those which most adorn
womanhood. It is not possible adequately to



180



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



express my sense of obligation for lier devotion.
She was a true Christian. Never was one
more earnestly prayed for during childhood
and manhood, during peace and war, than
myself. It was her loftiest ambition to guide
her children, by good example, jjure thoughts,
upright and praiseworthy life, to honorable
and noble purpose. To her unselfish de-
votion, her gentle and loving admonitions,
am I greatly indebted for whatever there
may be in me that is conmiendable. My
mother was a direct tlescendant of William
Curtis, who arrived in Boston on the ship
'Lyon,' September 16, 1632."

Mrs. Lydia (Jilbert Curtis, the mother of
Mary Curtis, married for her second husband
Mr. Hastings, of Princeton, Mass., the great-
grantlfather of the late ex-Governor Russell.
When seventy years old, she became the bride
of Deacon Timothy Downes, of Fitchburg.
She lived to the age of ninety.

Daniel Curtis Miles, the eldest child of Daniel,
Sr., and Mary Curtis Miles, was born in West-
minster, June, 1828. He married Lucy Ann
PufTer. Their children are: Mary Josephine,
George Melville, Herbert Judson, Arthur
Wellington, and Martha Gertrude. Daniel C.
Miles was for many years a popular teacher.
He afterward engaged in the lumber trade
and in manufacturing. He founfled the West-
minster National Bank, and was its president
twenty years. He is the present l)ank ex-
aminer of Massachusetts, and his son, Herbert
Jud.son, is his assistant.

The second child of Daniel and Mary (Curtis)
Miles is Mary Jane, who was born in West-
minster in June, 1832. She was a successful
teacher, interested in educational matters and
in church work. She has been a liberal con-
tributor to the Baptist society, and has accom-
plished much good in her quiet way. After
her marriage to Gardner Merriam, of Princeton,
she .settled in Leominster, Mass. Mr. and
Mrs. Merriam have four children — Nelson
Curtis, Nellie Gracie, Mary Anna, and Sadie
Jane.

Ann Maria Miles, the direct subject of this
.sketch, was born April 15, 1837, in Westminster,
Mass. She received a good education, and as
a teacher had a large experience in school



work. Interested in the welfare of her pupils,
she not only guided them in the paths of learn-
ing, but also trained them in those principles
of integrity and sound morality without
which no man or woman can achieve a perfect
success. An instance of the manner in which
she impressed upon her pupils the importance
of punctuality is found in the fact that her
youngest chikl attended school for fifteen
years without receiving an absent or tardy
mark.

Mrs. Sprague is a woman of excellent busi-
ness capacity, successfully managing large
affairs requiring tact, sound judgment, ex-
ecutive ability, and thorough knowledge of
business methods. For .seven years she held
a government post-office position. She is
actively interested in philanthropic work, being
a liberal contriliutor to various charities and
a helpful and freijuent visitor to the homes
of the poor and unfortunate. She has been
closely identi'ied with the work of the Little
Wanderers' Home and in placing children
in country homes, where they could be taught
u.seful occupations and learn to be self-sup-
porting.

Married in 1856 to Samuel Hazen Sprague,
she has since resided in Westminster, Mass.
She is the mother of five children — Lovvie
Maria, Samuel Nelson, Hattie Sophia, Theo-
docia Miles, and Lydia Gertrude.

Mrs. Sprague possesses in a high degree
the art of -freeable conversation. She has
travelled ex. iisively in ''s and foreign coun-
tries, has been an inteuigent and accurate
ob.server, and is well versed in the leading
topics of the day. A patriotic American,
she is prou(i of her country, and clo.sely fol-
lows every event that concerns our nation's
welfare.

Mrs. Sprague takes an especial pride in the
career of her distinguished brother, General
Nelson Appleton Miles, who was born in
Westminster, and name&lt;l by his mother in
honor of Appleton Monse, a devoted Baptist
clergyman. As Lieutenant of a company of
volunteers, which he organized at the begin-
ning of the Civil War, as Colonel of a regiment
and commander of a brigade in that conflict,
and later as a victorious leader against hostile

Indians, he rendered services that have added
to the glory and stability of our country,
and made his name a househokl word in our
land. Later, as Lieutenant Generajl of the
army, he attained the highest military rank
in the United States, and during his tour
around the world was tendered receptions
by kings, emperors, and other rulers. He
is honored in civil life as an eminent patriot
and citizen. General Miles married Mary
Hoyt Sherman, of Cleveland, Ohio, antl has
two children— Mary Cecelia Sherman and
Daniel Sherman. Mrs. Miles accompanied her
husband in his tour around the world, and
was received with distinguishetl honors.

Mrs. Sprague takes an interest in the
soldiers who have served with her brother
and with other leaders, and also in the army
nurses of the Civil War, being an honorary
member of the Massachusetts Army Nurse
Association.



HELEN C. MULFORD, Superintend-
ent for nine years of the iFranchise
'Department oif the Woman's Chris-
tian Temperance Union, of Barn-
stable County Mass., is a native of Chatham,
Mass., where she now resides tluring the
greater part of the year.

She was born August 3, 1S45, daughter of
Isaac Bea and Maria J. (Marston) Young.
She is a grand-daughter of Joseph. Jr., and
Bethia (Bea) Yovmg. ojreat-grancf ughter of
Joseph and Anna ickerson) \oung, and
great-great-grand-daughter of Hiatt and Mercy
(Hinckley) Young.

Two of these ancestors, nanicly, Hiatt
Young, of Chatham (born about 1739), and
his son Joseph, fought in the war for American
independence, Hiatt Young appearing with
the rank of Sergeant on the Revolutionary
rolls of the State. For a number of years he
was in Captain Webb's, later in Captain Hol-
brook's company, Colonel William Shepard's
regiment. It is related of him that upon reach-
ing his little home after his discharge from
the army, without a cent, weary and footsore,
having suffered many privations and hard-
ships, he left his footprints in blood upon the



newly scrubbed floor, and that they never
could be erased while the house remained
standing. An old memorandum records the
fact that the town refused to pay him the
bounty which was his due, amounting to thirty
pounds. His actual grave remains unknown.

The following is the inscription on a monu-
ment standing on a lot in the Universalist
cemetery, now owned by Isaac B. Young,
inscribed many years ago under the direction
of his eldest son, Joseph: —

:n memory of
HIATT YOUNG

WHO DIED OCT. 10, 1810, AGED 71 YEARS. IN
THE FRENCH WAR HE SERVED IN MAJOR ROGERRS' RAN-
GERS AND WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THE INDIANS. HE
ALSO SERVED SIX YEARS IN THE WAR OF THE REVOLU-
TION, AND WAS ENGAGED IN SEVERAL BATTLES: l.ST AT
THE SIEGE OF BOSTON; 21) IN THE BATTLE OF LONG
island; 3D AT PRINCETON; 4TH, TRENTON; 5TH,
TAKING OF BURGOYNE; 6TH, MONMOUTH; 7TH,
RHODE island; 8TH, CORNWALLIS. MERCY YOUNG,
HIS WIDOW, DIED OCT. 4TH, 18L'4, AGED 84 YEARS.

Joseph Young was so anxious that this
inscription should be executed correctly before
his death, which he felt was approaching, that
he had the stone brought to his front yard,
and the work done where he could look upon
it from his sick-bed and see that no mistake
was made.

Joseph Young was born September 25, 1762,
in Liverpool, N.S., antl died July 31, 1848,
about one week after the completion of the
monument. At the age of thirteen, in his
father's absence, he had nominal charge of
the support of the family. That his mother
could spare him a few years later is shown by
the fact that he himself enlisted before he was
sixteen.

The following was recorded by him in later
years : —

" I was so very small and short of stature
that I had to resort to stratagem to pass the
very yielding eye of an enlisting officer. I
put on a pair of my father's big cowhide boots,
and filled under my feet all that I could to raise
me up. Then I put on all the clothes I could
to make me stout. When I went before the



182

examining officer, I stretched myself all I
could, and was accepted. I was nine months
in Jackson's regiment, six months at Provi-
dence under Captain Job Crocker, nine months
in Shepard's regiment under Captain Grifhths,
of Yarmouth, in my father's name, and in the
last twenty-four months of the war under
Shepard, a part of the time in my father's
name and a part in my own, serving in all four
years, eight months.

"I stayed until peace was declared, and was
discharged back of Newburg before General
Washington took possession of New York,
without a cent to pay my expenses home,
which I reached after suffering many privations,
to find my father and family in distressed
circumstances, as neither of us had received
any compensation for our services. At this
time the Continental script was of such depre-
ciation in value that a month's wages would
not buy a bushel of corn.

" I travelled to Boston to secure our wages,
which the government was paying by issuing
notes, and fount! that Lieutenant Hamblin of
the Fourth Regiment, who was paymaster,
had disposed of our notes and run away to
Canada with the proceeds, so that was the last
that I ever heard of our wages. I was in the
battle of Rhode Island under General Sullivan
and in many other scrimmages, one at Moriseny,
another near Redden between Valley Forge and
Philadelphia, and many others, in which we
stood our ground bravely and were not daunted
to see a redcoat."

After the war Jo.'ieph Young married an esti-
mable young woman, Anna Nickerson, daughter
of Moses Nickerson. As he had no property
to speak of, her family, who were Tories, ob-
jected to the match, but in vain. He succeeded
in surmounting all difficulties, and in later
years assisted in the support of the Tory
family and many of their relations.

Joseph Young displayed the same courage
and determination in business that he had
shown as a soldier, and rose from fi.sherman to
master and owner of vessels. But tlie embargo
came, and his vessels lay idle, causing him
heavy losses. In the War of 1812 one of his
vessels, within twenty-four hours of home, was
Captured, and two of his sons, Joseph, Jr., and



Reuben, who were on board, were sent to
Dartmoor Prison, being afterward released.

After the war was over, Joseph Young
succeeded in retrieving his losses. It is re-
lated of him that he accumulated a handsome
property for his time. He reared a large
family, six daughters and three sons, and was
a very prominent citizen of Chatham, holding
all the highest othces in the town and serving
several years in the Legislature. He built a
cotton factory in Harwich and a woollen fac-
tory m Chatham, and was, in fact, a leader in
any enterprise that would help the community.
He was very public-spirited, and was liberal
in his benefactions to the poor. No one was
ever turned away from his (loor empty-handed.

A firm believer in the tloctrine of universal
salvation, he contributed largely to the building
of the first L^niversalist meeting-house on
Cape Cod. Joseph Young, Jr., was born
February 20, 1796, and died November 27,
1869. Isaac B. Young, his son, who is now
(1904) eighty-six yeais old and the last sur-
vivor of his branch of the family, is an honored
citizen of Chatham. His youngest brother,
George W. Young, died August 5, 1903. Maria
J. Marston Young, wife of Isaac B., died
January 3, 1894. She was a daughter of
Arthur B. and Hannah J. (Jones) Marston,
of West Barnstable, Cape Cod, Mass.

Helen C. Mulford was educated in the public
schools of Chatham, and before sixteen years
of age began a successful career as a teacher.
Siie liad tlie love and respect of all her pupils,
and li(M' poiiuiarity among them was an evi-
dence of her kindness, lier good judgment,
and ability in dealing with tho.se under her
charge. She was engaged in this profession
for several years, and among her most devoted
friends are some of her former pupils.

On July 14, 1864, she married Joseph W.
Mulford, an Acting Ensign in the United States
navy. Since her marriage Mrs. Mulford has
resided in Boston and Taunton, Mass. (where
she conducted a millinery and fancy goods
business), and Bridgewater, and for several
years has lived at her father's home in Chat-
ham, Mass.

Mrs. Mulford is interested in the Univer-
salist church in Chatham, of which her great-

grandfather was one of the founders. She
early became interested ui the woman suffrage
movement and in temperance work, and for
the past nine years has been County Super-
intentlent of the Franchise Department of
the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
She has supplied tliirteen towns with litera-
ture upon the subject, has conducted an ex-
tensive correspondence, and aided the cause
in many other ways. Mrs. Mulford not
only takes an active interest in every move-
ment for the atlvancement of women, but also
in the efforts for good government and for
the public schools. A local paper, referring
to the campaign of 1891, said: "The women
of Chatham have been carrying on a vigorous
campaign under the leadership of Mrs. Helen
Mulford. The town was districted in Septem-
ber, over seventy were assessed and i-egis-
tered, and nearly all voted. A correspontl-
ent writes: 'Mrs. Mulford deserves unbovmded
credit for her work, for the campaign was a
perfect success, and is so acknowledged by the
men, notwithstanding that nothing whatever
was done in the matter until the mitldle of
September. The women took hold with zeal,
and, though quiet and womanly in their work,
were determinetl to carry it through. The
best and most iafiuential women, younger and
older, cast their votes. The interest in town
meeting was never so intense, as shown from
the fact that more men voted than for four
years. We shall do still lietter next year.
All honor to the women of Chatham.'"

In 1889 Mrs. Mulford joined Frank D. Ham-
mond Woman's Relief Corps, No. 141, of South
Chatham, auxiliary to the Grand Army post
of that town, and entered upon its work with
enthusiasm. She was elected to fill various
offices, and was choseri president the second
year, but declined until' 1901. In that year
and in 1902 she was president of the corps,
performing her official duties in a dignified
and thorough manner. She was treasurer of
the corps six years, and is at present corps
patriotic instructor, ha^^ng charge of the work
of inculcating in the schools the spirit of love
and devotion to country. She has been a
participant in many department conventions,
and has served on important committees



in the State body, representing fourteen thou-
santl women. Mrs. Mulford has been a Na-
tional Aide antl special Aide in the Depart-
ment of Massachusetts, Woman's Relief Corps,
and is a delegate to the National Convention
to be held in Boston in August, 1904. This
will be a gathering representing one hundred
and fifty thousand loyal women of the countrj'.

Proud of her Revolutionary ancestry, she
Has taken an interegt in the history of that
great conflict anil in perpetuating the memory
of its heroes, and enjoys membership in Sarah
Bradlee Fulton Chapter, Daughters of the
Anierican Revolution, the headquarters of
which are at the Royall House, Medford.

In matters of business Mrs. Mulford shows
executive ability and a knowledge of financial
questions; in social life, those cjualities that
win and retain friends. Faithful to the highest
duties of life, loving the principles of right and
justice, and loyal to the cause of patriotism
and humanity, she enjoys being identified
with the [progressive work of the world.



KATHERINE LAWRENCE HOYLE,
for many years one of the best
known and most highly respected
women of Maiden, wafi born in
Medford, Mass., January 10, 1825, daughter
of Captain Martin and Eliza (Withington)
Burrage.

Her paternal ancestry has been traced back
to Robert Burrage, of Seething, Norfolk
County, England, whose will was proved in
the Bishop's Court at Norfolk, May 13, 1559,
his death having occurred in that year. His
wife's given name' was Rose. Mrs. Hoyle's
line of descent is through his son Richard,
the date of whose birth is not known, but
who resided in Norton Subcourse, Norfolk
County, England. Thomas Burrage, born
February 28, 1581, son of Richard, married
Frances Dey, August 19, 1606. He died
March 2, 1632-3.

John' Burrage, son of Thomas and his
wife Frances, was baptized in Norton Sub-
course, April 10, 1616. He was the founder
of this branch of the family in America. Com-
ing to Massachusetts and settling m Charles-

town, his name tx-ing on the records in 1637,
he took the freeman's oath May 18, 1642.
About 1639 he married his first wife, Mary,
whose maitlen surname is not known. His
second wife was Joanna Stowers. He dieil
October 19, 16S5.

William^ Burrage, the elder of the two sons
of John' who survived their father, was born
June 10, 1657. In the county records between
the years 1677 and 1690 he is called " a mariner."
His name appears in a list prej^ared by Con-
stable Greenwood for the use of the assessors
of taxes in Boston in 1674, and also in a list
of inhabitants of Boston in 1695. He died
in 1720.

John^ Burrage, born in Boston, February 11,
1693, son of William and his wife Sarah, died
January 24, 1765. He married first, October
9, 171S, Lydia Ward, who tlied in 1724. He
married January 17, 1725, Sarah Smith. He
was a farmer and lived in Newton, Mass.
William' Burrage, son of John' and Lydia
(Ward) Burrage, married December 13, 1744,
Hannah Osland. He moved to Concord, Mass.,
about 1756, and died in October, 1763.
John* Burrage, born August 29, 1755, married
May 10, 1781, Lois Barthrick, of Lunenburg.
He died July 2, 1822.

Captain Martin" Burrage, son of John'^ and
his wife Lois, was born July 27, 1793. He
became a prominent citizen of Medford, active
in town affairs, and was Captain of the crack
militia company of the town. In this capacity
he had the honor of escorting Cieneral La-
fayette in his last visit to this country and
of being personally complimented by him on
the fine military bearing of the company.
His sword is preserved in the family as a
valuable souvenir. His first wife, Eliza
Withington, was a woman of sterling qualities.
Her father established the old bakery that is
still standing in Medford and is probably th(&gt;
oldest in New England. After her death
Captain Burrage married for his second wife,
May 12, 1840, Hannah Pratt.

Katherine Lawrence Burrage was educated
in the public schools of Medford, and became
a teacher. When she was sixteen years old,
her parents sold their Medford farm and
bought one in Maiden, where the family



lived for many years. Here, long after, her
father died when in his eighty-sixth year.

At the age of twenty-five Miss Burrage
was married to Charles Frederick Syffernian,
a manufacturer of carriage and upholstery
trimmings in Maiden, witli a store on Otis
Street, Boston. Of this union there were
four children, two of whom did not survive
the period of infancy. The others, William
and Frederick, liveil but to reach the thresh-
old of a promising manhood, the former dying
at the age of eighteen and the latter at nine-
teen. Their memory is preserved in a gift
of eight thousand dollars left by Mrs. Hoyle
to the Maiden Public Library for the purchase
of books for the use of the young people of
the city. Mr. Syffernian flied in 1876, and
after some three years of comparative seclusion
his widow married for her second husband
Josiah Talbot, a lumber dealer of Maklen, a
member of the firm of Talbot Brothers. He
died in 1881. In 1882 Mrs. Talbot marriwl
Royal Teele of Medford. Mr. Teele died in
February, 1892, and on November 23, 1892,
his widow became the wife of Irving Julius
Hoyle, a native of Thompson, Conn. Mr.
Hoyle was born in 1850, son of Moses antl
Caroline (Joslin) Hoyle. Through his mother,
a daughter of Jesse and Sibyl (Bates) Joslin
an&lt;l grand-daughter of Jolui Bates and his
wife, Chloe Fuller, Mr. Hoyle is a descentlant
of Isaac AUerton, one of the ''Mayflower"
Pilgrims, ns thus sliown- Mary^ AUerton,

P'uller, wife of John Bates and great-grand-
mother of Mr. Hoyle. One of Mr. Hoyle's
ancestors on the paternal side was Chad Brown,
founder of the Rhode Island family for whom
lirown L^niversity was named.

Mr. and Mrs. Hoyle enjoyed some ten years
of happy home life, which was terminated
by her death on December 20, 1902, as the
result of pneumonia. She left no children.

Mrs. Hoyle was a woman of philanthropic
nature and broad sympathies, which found

characteristic expression, through her ample
means, in various benefactions and chari-
table works. To lend a helping hand to
every worthy cause, not grudging either
money or personal service, to extend to the
poor and unfortunate both helpful atlvice
and pecuniary aid, to do all that lay in her
power to make the world Ijetter and brighter
— this was the self-inijiosed mission wliich
she nobly fulfilled. She was an incorporator
and one of the trustees of the Maiden Hos-
pital; one of the original incorporators in
Maiden of the Y. M. C. A.; and a trustee and
at the time of her death one of the board of
managers of the Home for Aged People in
Maiden. To each of these institutions she
made generous bequests — one thousand dol-
lars to the hospital, two thousand dollars
to the Y. M. C. A., and a .similar amount to
the Home for Ageil People. She also l(&gt;ft three
hunilred dollars to the city of Medford to main-
tahi perpetually a drinking fountain, erected
by her at the corner of Spring and Salem
.Streets, also the same amount to the city of
Maiden for the permanent care of a drinking
fountain previously erected by her in Jud.son
Square, Maiden. She left the cities of Med-
ford and Maiden several similar amounts
for the care of her lot in Salem Street Cemetery ;
Maiden, the care of her father's lot in Oak
Grove Cemetery, Medford, and for the care
of the lot of her former husliand, Mr. Teele,
in Medford. To the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals she left two thousand
dollars. Wilbraham Academy received from
her the gift of one thousand dollars. Her
memory is perjjetuated in the Centre Meth-
odist Church of Malilen by her gift of a silver
communion service. The residue of her
fortune, excepting some i)rivate bequests,
was left to Mr. Hoyle.

Mrs. Hoyle was a constant attendant at
the First Congregational Church, the pastor
of which, the Rev. H. H. French, officiated
a4 her funeral, assisted by the pastor of
the Centre Methotlist Church, the Rev. Mr.
Hughes. A womanly woman and a practical
Christian, she left behind a fragrant memory
of her life and character that shall long
endure.



HELEN N. PACKARD, widely known
as a newspaper correspondent, a
writer of poems, and an enthusias-
tic worker in patriotic societies, is
one of the recent accessions from New England
to the journalistic ranks of the Pacific coast,
having removed from Springfield, Ma.ss., to
Portlantl, Ore., in 1901. This was three
years ago, eight years after the death of her
husband, John A. Packard, a veteran of the
Civil War.

Mrs. Packard is a native of Maine. Her
maiden name was Clark. She was born in
\Mnterport, Waldo County, being one of the
ten children of Lemuel and Harriet (Brown)
Clark.

The Clark family of Winterport is one of
the very oldest and most respected of the town,
Lemuel Clark, Sr., having come there from
Kittery nearly one hundred and fifty years
ago. The original farm of the progenitor of
the family is now owned and occupied by his
great-grandson.

]\Irs. Packard's father was a sea-captain,
engaged mostly in the West India trade, but
also visiting foreign ports. Two of his brothers
served in the War of 1812. Mrs. Packard's
mother, born in 1812, was daughter of .John, Jr.,
and Sally (Crosby) Brown, of Belfast, Me.
John Brown, Sr., removed from Londonderry,
N.H., in 1773. He had been an officer in the
Provincial army in the French antl Indian War.
He was one of the first board of selectmen
of Belfast, and is said to have been a man of
"great vigor, energy, and honesty." He died
in LS17, aged eighty-two years. His son,
John, Jr., born in 1763, died in 1824 (History
of Belfast). Both father and son were mem-
bers of the Committee of Inspection and Safety
during the struggle for Ainerican independence,
and both rendered valuable service to the
infant country. John Brown, Sr., was one of
three men who alone of all the settlement re-
fused to take the oath of allegiance to Great
Britain when the British fleet appeared in
Penobscot Bay in 1779, preferring to sacrifice
all his possessions, which he did, but they were
restored to him in 1783.

Sally Crosby, described by one who had seen
her as a "remarkably sedate, sensible, goilly



186



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



woman," was born in 1774, the daughter of
Simon and Sarah (Sewall) Crosby. Her mother,
great-grandmother of Mrs. Packard, was daugh-
ter of Nicholas antl Mehitable (Storer) Sewall,
of York, Me., and sister of Stephen Sewall, the
learned professor of Hebrew at Harvard Uni-
versity in the latter part of the eighteentli
century. Nicholas Sewall was son of Johii^
(Henry' ') and nephew of SamueP Sewall,
the distinguished Judge Sewall of colonial
times.

Lemuel Clark was a man of intense loyalty
to his country, but was too old to enlist in the
Civil War of 1861-65. He sent two of his sons
to the front, one of whom returned, the other
being killed at Antietam.

His daughter Helen was reared in an atmos-
phere of patriotism, and was but a school-girl
when she began to work for the soldiers. vShe
scraped lint, knitted socks, packed bo.xes of
comforts, and after the war was over raised
money from various entertainments for the
benefit of the soldiers. When only fifteen
years old she went about the outlying dis-
tricts of Winterport, canvassing for provisions
for the soldiers' fair to be held in her native
town. After her graduation from the high
school she continued her studies for a time at
a boarding-school for girls.

John Alvin A. Packard, to whom she was
married in 1867, served as a Lieutenant in the
Fifth Maine Regiment in the Civil War, and had
an honorable record as a brave soldier. He
participated in all the battles of the Army of
the Potomac, from Bull Hmi to Gettysburg.
One week after Gettysbiu-g, while leading his
company in an engagement, he was wounded
by a bullet, which passed through his body
and lodged in a tree. He resigned the fol-
lowing November, but it was thirteen months
before the wound was healetl. For a few years
Mr. and Mrs. Packard made their home in
Portland, Me. In 1874 they removed to Spring-
field, Mass. They became the parents of three
sons: Walter Alvin, born December 17, 1877;
Arthur Howard, born November 17, 1879; and
Raymond Clark, born July 11, 1881. Mr.
Packard died in Springfield, at the age of fifty-
eight years, May 1, 1893, from disease contracted
in the service thirty years before.



While living in Portland, Me., Mrs. Packard
joined the AVoman's Auxiliary to the Portland
Army and Navy Union. For many years slie
contributed letters and articles to the press
in behalf of the soldiers of the Civil War, en-
deavoring to awaken an interest in their needs.
She has received hundreds of letters of appre-
ciation from soldiers in all sections of the
country and many official votes of thanks from
posts and regimjjntal associations, also lettefs
from Dr. Olivei' Wendell Holmes, John J. In-
galls, and many distinguished generals of the
Civil War.

Invitations ha\e been extended to Mrs.
Packard to write for Grand Army gather-
ings from Maine to Texas. In October, 1889,
at the dedication of the Maine monuments,
she read an original poem at the sunmiit of
Little Round Top, Gettysburg, entitled "The
Voice of Maine." Among the many popular
poems she has written are "Decoration Day,"
"The Old Guard." "In Memoriam," and "Me-
morial Day." \\'hen tlie memorial building
of the Fifth Maine Regiment was dedicated
at Peak's Island, Portland, Me., Mrs. Packard
by special invitation read original verses.

The Magazine of Poelrij and lAterary Revieir,
in its issue of October, 1895, referred to her
work as follows: "All of Mrs. Packard's poems,
whether |)atriotic, descrijttive, psychical, in-
trospective, or in lighter vein, evince a deep and
original mind, a keen insight into nature, a
sincere faith, and a graceful and concise mode
of expression. Several of her poems have been
arranged as songs, a setting for which they are
particularly well adapted."

Among the publications in which Mrs. Pack-
ard's writings have appeared are the Spring-
field R.ej)ul)liran, Homestead and Vniun, the
Repidtlican Joiirnal uf Maine, Ladies' Home
Journal, Good Housekee/pinq, Youth's Compan-
ion, Boston Transcript, and various Western
papers; among the magazines, the Twentieth
Ceniury, New Natiort, and New Idea.

During more than twenty-five years' resi-
dence in Springfield, Mass., Mrs. Packard was
a friend to l). K. Wilcox Post, G. A. R., of that
city, of which her husband was an active mem-
ber. She joined the Relief Corps auxiliary to
this post in 188.1, and was vice-president three

187



years and chairman of its executive committee
six years. She helped to earn thousands of
dollars for the memorial building of E. K.
Wilcox Post, and is held in grateful remem-
brance by the post and corps, her work for
the Grand Army being well known throughout
the State. She participatetl as a delegate in
several conventions of the Department of
Massachusetts, A\'omau's Relief Corps. At the
time of the Spanish-American War she was one
of the organizers, and was corres])on(iing sec-
retary and a director, of the Springfield Aux-
iliary to the Massachusetts Volunteer Aid
Association. Her two elder sons enlisted for
service in Cuba, and Arthur fell on the firing
line at El Caney, July 1, 189S, pierceil by a
Mauser bullet. The death of this young patriot,
only eighteen years of age, and the frantic grief
of the ekler brother over his dead body was a
fruitful theme for the newspajter correspondents
in Cuba, from Richard Harding Davis down
to the humblest wielder of the pen; and the
ti'agic circumstance was the original of the
statue at the I^uffalo I'ixposition entitled " l']l
Caney."

Her eldest son, Walter, returned from Cuba
broken in health from yellow fever, and
was obliged to leave the bleak climate of New
England for the Far West. For this reason
Mrs. Packard in 1901 resigned her position as
literary editor of the Springfield Daily News,
and moved to Portland, Ore.

In her new home she is still actively engaged in
public work She has been patriotic instructor
and also ])ress corresj)oiKlent of George ^^ right
Relief Corps of Portland, Ore., and in 190;i was
elected a national delegate to the Woman's
Relief Corps convention in San Francisco.
Her interest in the old soldiers is as strong as
ever. She is correspondent for several liast-
ern papers. After the close of the National
Pmcampment at Buffalo the Tmies of that city
said, " Of all the hundreds of press con-espond-
ents who sent out letters describing the en-
campment, none equalled in graphic descrip-
tion those sent by 'H. N. P.' to the Spring-
field Republican." Mrs. Packard represented
the same paper in 1903 at the Frisco encamp-
ment, where she received a cordial greeting
from a host of Grand Army comrades. Mrs.



Packartl has held several offices in the United
Order of the Pilgrim Fathers, including that
of Governor of the Colony in Springfield. She
is also a member of Mercy Warren Chapter,
of Springfield, of the Daughters of the American
Revolution. When a resident of Massachu-
setts she was identified with the New England
Woman's Press A.ssociation. As her works
testify, she is a woman of talent ami of much
executive ability.

Mrs. Packard has had rather more than the
ordinary share of troubles which fall to the lot
of mortals, but has borne all her many trials
with fortitutle and cheerfulness, always hold-
ing the faith that some good purpose underlies
all the worries of humanity. Her New Eng-
land birth and training, and inheritance of
courage from a long line of ancestors, have
doubtless ujihcld her where others would have
failed.

Mrs. Packard now receives the pension of
a Ijieutenant's widow, secured to her by special
act of Congress through the efforts of the Hon.
Malcolm A. Moody, Representative from the
Second Congressional District of Oregon.



MARY E. ALLEN.— At the time of the
French Revolution it is related that
two young brothers were sent away
from France, and sailed from their
native town of Brest, in two different vessels,
for America. One of them was never heard
from more. The other, as he told the story,
was shipwrecked off the coast of Massachu-
setts, reacheil the shore with some difficulty,
in scanty clothing, and sought refuge at the
nearest farmhouse, where he was taken in
and given work. He could speak no English,
and, as the people he came among were equally
ignorant of his language, the farmer sought
the nearest equivalent in soimd to the name
given by the stranger, and called him Cornelius
Allen. This name he afterward bore, re-
maining a resilient of Massachusetts, where
he married and had a large family. His son
Joseph married Mary Nowell, of York, Me.
She was of Scotch and English descent. The
youngest of their six children was Mary E.
Allen, the subject of this sketch, who was born



188



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



in 1844 in Barre, Mass. She remembers once
seeing this old grandfather, who made a strange
impression upon her childish imagination, with
his broken English and his velvet coat, an ele-
gance not affected by the fanning population
among whom he lived. He ilied when she was
quite a child, and all subseciuent attempts to
trace her true name and French ancestry have
proved imavailing. Her early years were spent
in a country village until the death of her par-
ents, when, at the age of eight, she was adopted
by her uncle, Mr. James Nowell, of Ports-
mouth, N,.H.

In 1859 the family that had now become
hers moved to Cambridge, Mass. She entered
the Cambridge High School, from which she
was graduated in 1862. The profession of
teacher seemed best adapted to her, and
events have proved that she chose wisely.
Her work began in Montpelier, Vt., and, be-
fore her first year was over, she received a
cell to the Williams School, a large school for
boys in Chelsea, Mass. At the end of her first
year she was given the position of master's
assistant, which she occupied for two years,
resigning in the spring of 1868, to accept the
position of assistant gymnastic teacher in
Vassar College. Through some misunderstand-
ing among the faculty this plan was not car-
ried out, and in the fall of the same year she
accepted the position of master's assistant
in the Chapman School in East Boston, a
mixed school of girls and boys.

Miss Allen was always a popular teacher,
nmch beloved by her pupils and appreciated
by their parents, and she thoroughly enjoyed
the work; but she rebelled at the mass of use-
less cramming imposed upon the public school
teacher, and found herself opposed in principle
to spending so much time in fitting for exami-
nations, when she would gladly have devoted
herself to teaching in its broader sense. Full
of energy and ambition, she chafed at the re-
straints of her position, realizing also that,
however great the eminence to which she might
attain as a teacher, .she could not, being a
woman, aspire to the only two positions above
her in the grammar school, those of submaster
and master.

All this, added to the excessive strain of



the daily routine upon an organization not over
robust, forced her to look about for some other
field of work in which to e.xercise her unusual
powers, before they s"hould begin to wane.
For a long time she had been interested in
physical training, and during the last tlozen
years she had aroused much enthusiasm for
gymnastics in her classes at school.

Miss Allen's interest in this subject led her
into a field which she found was almost un-
explored. Nowhere in Boston could a woman
or child secure any regular ])hysical training.
Further investigation revealed the same lack
of opportunity in this direction throughout
the country. Classes in gynmastics had been
opened in Boston and elsewhere, both before
and after Dr. Dio Lewis's day; but nothing
had proved permanent, and Dr. Lewis's phe-
nomenal work had been practically dead for
a dozen years or more.

Allured by this untried path, she soon se-
cured the hearty support and co-operation of
many of the most prominent Boston physi-
cians of the day. Not only did they semi their
patients to her, but their wives and children
also joined her classes. The enterprise, begun
quietly in 1878 in a meagrely equipped room
in E.ssex Street, under the name of "The
Ladies' Gymnasium," was popular from the
start.

At the end of the first year Miss Allen real-
ized that her pupils who returnerl to her must
have more advanced work. Then began her
scheme for progressive physical development,
which she has been greatly interested in per-
fecting, as the years have gone on.

She was the first to introduce the sensible
gynmastic costume (consisting of blouse and
Turkish trousers, with no skirt), allowing per-
fect freedom of motion, which is now adopted,
in similar form, in all gynmasiums. A promi-
nent Boston physician, on visiting her classes,
remarked that it would be worth while for the
women simply to put on this healthful dress
and play about in the gymnasium a while,
even if they did not ]ierform any of the exer-
cises. It is probable that the physical train-
ing for women, of which Miss Allen was the
pioneer, has been one of the potent factors in
diminishing the evils of tight lacing, which in



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



189



those days was much more the rule than at
present.

Growing interest and enthusiasm for the
work of the gymnasium necessitated a change
at the end of the second year to more com-
modious quarters in Amory Hall, on the corner
of Washington and West Streets. The pro-
spective need of teachers in this fiell led to
the intioduction of a normal cdurse for their
education, which has remained a permanent
department of tlie gymnasium. Constantly
increasing numbers, and an interest that con-
tinued to grow, finally culminated in a demand
for a larger hall and better eriuipment. A
stock company was formed, which within two
months raised the sum of fifty thousand dol-
lars, and during the summer of 1SS6 a build-
ing was constructed on St. Botolph and Gar-
rison Streets, known thereafter as the Allen
Gymnasium. This contained one of the larg-
est and best equipped gymnasiums in the coun-
try, with a large nuMiber of private ilressing-
rooms, lavatories, and lockers, and in the base-
ment six fine bowling alleys.

During the next few years the numbers
greatly increased, and hundreds of pupils at-
tended yearly, so that in 1891 still larger ac-
commodations seemed necessary, especially a
properly constructed room for the deep-
breathing exercises, which have always
formed an essential part of the plan of work.
An annex was accordingly built, with a room
arranged for respiratory M'ork, with special
mechanical means for insuring pure air, over
another gymnasium hall, while below were
exquisitely finished Turkish and Russian baths,
and a beautiful swimming-pool. The two
buildings occupied a lot one hundred and
fifty feet by ninety feet, and the city of Boston
may well have been proud of possessing an
institution which, devoted as it was to the in-
terests of women and children exclusively,
was unique in the annals of the country.

As the years went by, other schools of phys-
ical training were^ established, bicycle-riding
and athletics became the fashion for women
as well as men, and many other causes con-
spired to render the classes somewhat smaller
than heretofore, although the enthusiasm of
those who came was undiminished. Accord-



ingly it was finally decidetl to transfer the
gymnasium to the beautifully eejuipped smaller
hall over the Turkish baths, where the work
has been successfully carrietl on for the past
four years, and still continues with unabated
interest.

It is not simply as an admirable teacher of
gymnastics that Miss Allen is entitled to the
gratitude of the comnmnity. In her carefully
worked- out system of physical training, where
brain and nuiscles play an equal part, she has
made a lasting contribution to educational
science. A pioneer, and for a time almost the
ordy woman engaged in this line of work, she
entered the field just at the time when it was
beginning to be felt that order might be brought
out of the chaos which had hitherto prevailed
in the gymnasium. Prior to this period the
comparatively few gymnasiums that existed
had been largely usetl liy professionals and
those who devoted themselves to the exag-
gerated development of certain sets of muscles,
in order to accomplish feats of strength, agil-
ity, or endurance. No all-around develop-
ment had yet been attempted. She now threw
herself with ardor into the task of organizing
some scheme of symmetrical training, and
later, as the way opened before her, she ear-
nestly strove to lift gymnastics into the domain
of education.

At that time the only plea for gymnastics
was in the interest of health. While fully con-
vinced of the importance of this aim. Miss
Allen felt that there was another side of the
subject to be brought out, in which the field
of investigation was as yet untrotlden. She
developed a scheme of progressive gymnastics
which would gradvially bring every part of
the body under the control of the will. The
discovery made a few years later, in the realm
of physiological research, of the "motor tracts"
in the brain — i.e., definite nerve centres initi-
ating and controlling motion in every part of
the body — gave the physical trainer a place
in the educational field. This cleared the way
not only for her, but for others whowere work-
ing along similar lines of thought.

The educational value of her work lies in
the progressive nature of her scheme of train-
ing, in which she has sought to develop the



190



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



natural sequence of brain action in co-ordi-
nated movements. Such education not only
results in ph_ysical development, but in the
acquisition of courage, alertness, self-possession,
nervous control in many ways, general con-
centration of thought, and other expansion
of the higher nature. "If," to use her own
words, "the aim of education is to stimulate
thought, and its end to equip one for living,
then harmonious brain development is essen-
tial. It is now universally conceded that the
cultivated brain is not the largest nor the heav-
iest, but the one in which the most brain cells
are vital, and where the connections between
cells are must numerous and intimate: these
are the conditions upon which mental vigor
depends. No part of the physical brain, there-
fore, should be deprived of its fair share in
development, and our educators must sooner
or later recognize the fatal mistake, found in
all our school and college curriculums, of ex-
cluding to so great a degree the education of
those nerve centres whose ])rimary expression
is in motion, but whose vitality reacts in many
directions."

The attempt to bring about a wiser attitude
toward this department of education, and to
give her pupils a clear sense of the culpabil-
ity of sickness, which is largely the result of
ignorance and self-indulgence, has been the
inspiration of her work.

This brief sketch would be quite incom))lete
without a few words regarding the personality
of its subject. Miss Allen is small, slentler,
and graceful, with great personal charm, and
an unusual amount of that indefinable quality
which we call magnetism. She is radical in
matters of religion and politics, and takes an
active interest in the principal reforms of the
day, especially the Woman Suffrage movement.
Although her sincerity is uncompromising, and
might be called the keynote of her character,
yet her sweetness and grace of manner always
charm even tho.se of widely differing views.
She is an indefatigable worker, never sparing
herself in her conscientious devotion to her
life work in all its details.

As a teacher, she is most illuminating, always
making her pupils think in connection with
their work, so as to understand just what they



are trying to do; and she detects with unerring
wisdom the precise cause of their failures.
The.se usually arise from a lack of co-ordina-
tion on the part of the pupil: the physical
task demanded has not been sufficiently im-
pressed upon the brain at the outset, or the
muscular forces are sluggish in obeying its
behest. Often, in the case of adult pupils,
it is .sufficient to call attention to this deficient
co-ordination of brain and muscle, in oriler
to remedy the trouble completely, whereas
a teacher ignorant of this subtle truth might
drill a class on the same exercise for hours,
without removing the difficulty. This method
of true scientific instruction is not only a great
economy of time, but also awakens and re-
tains the interest of her pupils, who are con-
scious that they are always learning something
new.

Another source of the unflagging interest
aroused by this truly wonderful teacher is
her constant introduction of new and vary-
ing exercises, without destroying the progres-
sive character of the work as a whole. She
realizes that human nature loves variety, and
that the repetition of one set of movements
or one species of activity cannot fail to pall
upon the pupil after a time. Accordingly,
with inexhaustible fertility of resources, she
is continually inventing fresh and interesting
work, so that even pupils who have been in
her classes for twelve or fifteen years can never
sigh for novelty or change.

Miss Allen's strong and attractive pensonality
has contributed in no small degree to the suc-
cess of her work by winning friends for her
on every side, and enlisting the hearty co-opera-
tion of her pupils. Certainly no teacher in
any field has gained a more . loyal following
than hers.

The above gives but a very imperfect idea
of the remarkable woman who for the last
quarter of a century has contributed, perhaps
more than any other one person, toward the
vigor and well-being of our women. Her
work will surely live after her, both in its con-
tribution to educational science and in the
increased efficiency of hundreds of human
lives.

LUCY STONE was born August 13, ISIS,
on a rocky farm on Coy's Hill, about
_^ three miles from West Brookfield,
Mass. She was the daughter of Francis
Stone and his wife, Hannah Matthews, and
was the eighth of nine children. She came of
good New England stock. Her great-grand-
father, Francis Stone, first, fought in the P'rench
and Indian War. Her grandfather, Francis
Stone, second, was an officer in the war of the
Revolution and afterward Captain of four
Jiundred men in Shays's Rebellion. Pier father,
the third Francis Stone, was a man of uncom-
mon force and ability, as well as of much nat-
ural wit and brightness. He had been a suc-
cessful teacher and afterward an exceptionally
skilful tanner in North I^rookfield. But the
moral surroundings of the tan-yard were so
bad for the chiklren that his wife, a beautiful,
pious, and submissive woman, ro.se in rebellion
against them, and insisted that, for the chil-
dren's sake, the family must move away. Her
husband j'ielded to her appeal. He nKJved to
Coy's Hill, and took up farming with his usual
energy. It is said that, as he called the cows
in the early morning, his fine, .sonorous voice
used to be heard by the other farmers for a mile
around, and .served as a sort 'of rising bell to
the whole neighborhood. Mr. Stone was kind
to -the poor, and was much respected in the
connnunity; but he was fully inibueil with the
idea of the right of husbands to rule over their
wives, as were most men of his gen(&gt;ration.
His wife obeyed him implicitly, as a religious
duty. Lucy was born about a year after her
mother had made, in behalf of her childi-en,
almost the only deterniined stand in all her
gentle life; and it has been suggested that this
fact, through heredity, may have had some-
thing to do with Lucy's remarkable character.

Every one on the farm worked. The mother
milked eight cows the night before Lucy was
born, a sudden thunder-shower having called
all tlie men into the hay-field. She said re-
gretfully, when informed of the sex of the new
baby, "Oh, dear! I am sorry it is a girl. A
woman's life is so hard!"

Little Lucy gicw up a healthy, vigorous
child, noted for fearlessness and truthfulness,
a good scholar, and a hard worker in the house



and on the farm, sometimes driving the cows
by starlight, before the sun was up, when the
dew on the grass was so cold that she would
stop on a flat stone and curl one small bare
foot \i\) against the other leg to warm it. There
was no task about the house or farm so hard
but she would grapple with it with cheerful
resolution, if it needed to be done.

In the same resolute way she set herself to
subtlue the faults of her own character. She
had a fiery temper. One day when she was
about twelve years old her younger sister
Sarah had angered her, and Lucy chased her
through the house to inflict condign punish-
ment. Hajjpening to catch sight of her own
face in a looking-glass, she was .shocked by its
whiteness and wrath. She said to herself,
"That is the face of a murderer!" She went
out and sat on a rock behind the barn, holding
one bare foot in her hand and rocking to and
fro, thinking what she could do to get the
better of such a temper. She sat there till it
was after dark, and her mother came to the
door and called her in. From that time on
she made a determined fight for self-control,
and in her later life the serene gentleness of
her face and of her whole aspect made it hard
for people to realize that she had e^■er had
such a temper. The little girl early became
indignant at the way she saw her mother ami
other women treated by their husbands and
by the laws, and she made up her childish
mind that those laws must be changed. Read-
ing the Bible one day, while still a child, she
came upon the text, "Thy tlesire shall be to
thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
At first she wanted to die. Then she resolved
to go to college, study Greek and Hebrew, read
the Bible in the original, ami satisfy herself
whether such texts were correctly translated.

Her father saw nothing strange about it
when his sons decided to go to college, but,
when his daughter wanteil to go, he said to
his wife, "Is the child crazy?" He would not
help her. The young girl had to earn the
money herself. She picked berries and chest-
nuts, and sold them to buy hooks. For years
she taught district schools, studying and teach-
ing alternately. At first she was paid a dollar
a week, and "boarded around." She soon be-



192



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



came known as a successful teacher, and grad-
ually received a higher salary, but could never
rise above sixteen dollars per month, which
was considered "very good pay for a woman."
Once she was engaged to teach a winter school
which had been broken up, the big boys throw-
ing the master head foremost out of the window
into a deep snowdrift. As a rule, women were
not thought competent to teach the winter
term of school, because then the big boys were
released from farm work and were able to at-
tend. In a few days she had this difficult
school in perfect order, and the big boys who
had made the trouble became her most de-
voted lieutenants; yet she received only a frac-
tion of the salary paid to her unsuccessful pred-
ecessor.

She studied for a time at the Monson, Qua-
boag, and Wilbraham Academies. Generally,
she and her sister Sarah did not board at the
academy, but for economy's sake took a room
and cooked their own food, bruiging most of
their provisions from home.

An old schoolmate recalls the fact that she
was already dee])ly interested in the abolition
movement, and her compositions were always
about slavery. About 1838 Lucy went to
Mount Holyoke Seminary. Years before .she
had heard Mary Lyon make an appeal for
funds for this effort in behalf of higher educa-
tion for women. The sewing-circle with which
Lucy was connected was at that time working
to pay the expenses of a young man prc])aring
for the ministry, and Lucy was making a shirt.
She was nmch stirred by Mary Lyon's presenta-
tion of the need of better educational opportuni-
ties for women, and by the thought of how much
easier it was for any young man to earn his
education than for a young woman to do so
at a woman's low pay: and she ceased sewing
upon that shirt, and felt in her heart the hope
that no one would ever finish it. She spent
less than a year at Mount Holyoke, being called
home by the death of an older sister; but she
always retained an affection for the institu-
tion.

Instead of the mite-boxes for foreign missions
that were the fashion among the Mount Holyoke
students, Lucy kept in her room one of the
little yellow collection boxes of the Anti-slavery



Society, which bore the picture of a kneeling
slave holding up manacled hands, with the
motto, "Am I not a man and a brother?"
Into this she put all the pennies she could
spare. She also placed William Lloyd Garri-
son's paper, the Liberator, in the reading-room
of the seminary. For some time they could
not find out who did it; but they suspected
Lucy, because of her anti-slavery principles,
and, when they asked her, she acknowledged
it at once. Even the saintly Mary Lyon was
doubtful about the wisdom of allowing it. She
said to Lucy, "You nuist remember that the
slavery question is a very grave question, and
a question u)«)n which the best people are di-
vided."

At about the age of nineteen Lucy joined
the Orthodox Congregational church in W^est
Brookfield. Soon after, Deacon Henshaw was
brought to trial before the church for having
entertained anti-slavery speakers at his house
and otherwise aided and abetted the abolition
movement. When the first vote was taken,
Lucy, who did not know that women could
not vote in church meetings, held up her hand
with the rest. The minister, a tall, dark man,
pointed fner to her, and said to the man who was
counting the votes. "Don't you count her."
The man said, "Why, isn't she a member?"
"Yes," answered the minister, "she is a mem-
ber, but not a voting member." His accent of
scorn stirred her indignation. "Six votes were
taken at that meeting, and I held up my hand
every time," she said to her daughter, raising
her hand above her head, with a flash in her
eye, as she recalled the incident, while lying
on her death-bed. Deacon Henshaw, Lucy,
and a number of other members were later
drojiped from the rolls of the church for their
activity in the anti-slavery cause.

On June 27, 1837, the General Association
of the Orthodox Congregational Churches of
Massachusetts met at Brookfield. There had
been a great outcry against the anti-slavery
speaking of Abby Kelley and the Grimke
sisters; and a pastoral letter from the Asso-
ciation to the churches under its charge had
been prepared, to be read at this meeting. The
object of the letter was to close the churches
against anti-slavery lectures, and especially



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



193



to silence the women. It calleil attentujn to
dangers now seeming " to threaten the female
character with wide-spread and permanent
injury." It claimed that the New Testament
clearly defined "the appropriate duties and
influence of women. Tlie power of woman
is in her dependence. When she assumes the
place and tone of a man as a public reformer,
our care and protection of her seem unneces-
sary: we put ourselves in self-defence against
her. She yields the power which Cod has given
her for protection, and her character becomes
unnatural." The letter especially cf)ndenined
those "who encourage females to bear an ob-
trusive and ostentatious })art in measures of
reform, and countenance any of that sex who
so far forget themselves as to itinerate in the
character of public lecturers and teachers." This
was the letter which Whittier called the " Brook-
fiekl Bull," and of which he wrote: —

" So this is all — the utmost reach

Of priestly power the mind to fetter!
VVlieii laymen tliink, when women preach, —
A war of words — a ' Pastoral Letter '! "

Lucy went to the meeting. The body of the
church was black with ministers, and the gal-
lery was tilled with women and laymen. While
the famous letter was being read, the Rev.
Dr. Blagden marched up and down the aisle,
turning his head from side to side and looking
at the women in the gallery, as nuich as to
say, "Now we have silenced you." Lucy lis-
tened in great indignation, and at each aggra-
vating sentence she nudged her cousin, who
said afterward that her side was black antl
blue. At the close of the meeting she told her
cousin that, if she ever had anything to say
in public, she would say it, and all the more
because of that pastoral letter.

At the low wages received by women teachers
it took Lucy until she was twenty-five to earn
the money to carry her to Oberlin, then the
only college in the country that admitted
women and colored men. Among most New
Englanders Oberlin was unpopular, partly be-
cause of its radicalism on the negro (juestion
and the woman ciuestion, Ijut chiefly because
the authorities of the college believed in the
doctrine of "entire sanctification." It was re-



garded as a highly heretical place, ami the feel-
ing against it was strong. Deacon White, of
West Brookfield, took the Oberlin Emmjelist,
but his wife would not touch the paper, and
used to hand it to him with the tongs. Here
or nowhere, however, Lucy had to get her col-
legiate education.

She set out on the long journey to Ohio with
only seventy dollars in her jnirse toward the
expenses of the four years' course, but with
her heart full of courage and her head of good
conmion sense. Crossing Lake Erie from Buf-
falo to Cleveland, she could not afford a state-
room, l)ut slept on deck on a pile of grain sacks,
among horses and freight, with a few other
women who, like herself, could only pay for
a "tleck passage." At Oberlin she earned her
way by teaching in the preparatory depart-
ment of the college, antl by doing housework
in the Ladies' Boarding Hall at three cents an
horn-. Most of the students were poor, and
the college furnished them board at a dollar a
week. But she could not afford even this
small sum, ami during most of her course she
cooked her food in her own room, boarding
herself at a cost of less than fifty cents a week.
Her father's disapproval of a collegiate educa-
tion for girls finally gave way before his ad-
miration of her sturdy perseverance, in which
he perhaps felt something akin to his own
character; and he wrote offering to lend her
the money to carry her through the rest of her
course, and urging her not to hurt her health
by overwork. She would accept only a small
sum, how(;ver, preferring to earn her own way
as far as jiossible. She taught country schools
during the vacations, and had some hard ex-
periences, anmsing to look back upon, in the
rough and primitive neighboi'hoods of the new
West. Throughout her college course she wore
cheap calico tlresses with white collars, launder-
ing them herself, and being always so clean and
trim that she used to be held up to the other
young women by the members of the Laiiies'
Board as an examjjle of how exquisite neatne.ss
could go hand in hand with the closest economy.
She had only one or two new dresses while at
Oberlin, and she did not go home once during
the four years; but she thoroughly enjoyed
college life, and found time also for good works.

Ol)orlin was a station on the "underground
railway," a town of strong anti-slavery sym-
pathies, and many fugitive slaves settled there.
A school was started to teach them to read,
and Lucy was asked to take charge of it. The
colored men, fresh from slavery and densely
ignorant, still felt it beneath their dignity to
be taught by a woman. Without letting her
know this, the committee took her to the school
and introduced her to them as their teacher,
thinking they would not like to express their
objections in her presence. But there was a
murmur of dissatisfaction, and presently a tall
man, very black, stood up and said he hail
nothing against Miss Stone personally, but he
was free to confess that he did not like the idea
of being taught by a woman. She persuaded
them that it would be for their advantage to
learn from anybody who could teacli them to
read; and her dusky pupils soon became nivich
attached to her. When the Ladies' Boarding
Hall took fire, during her temporary absence,
many members of her colored class rushed to
the fire, bent on saving her effects. She was
told on her return that a whole string of colored
men had arrived upon the scene one after an-
other, each demanding breathlessly, "Where is
Miss Stone's trunk?"

Her first public speech was made during
her college course. The colored people got
up a celebration of the anniversary of West
Indian emancipation, and invited her to be
one of the speakers. The president of the col-
lege and some of the professors were also in-
vited. She gave licr address among the rest,
and thought nothing of it. The next day she
was sunmioned before the Ladies' Board (a
sort of advisory boartl, composed of the pro-
fessors' wives, who supervised the young
women of the college). They represented to
her that it was unwomanly and unscriptural
for her to speak in public. The president's
wife said: "Did you not feel yourself very nmch
out of place up there on the platform among
all those men? Were you not embarrassed
and frightened?" "Why, no, Mrs. Mahan,"
she answered. "'Those men' were President
Mahan and my professors, whom I meet every
day in the class-room. I was not afraid of
them at all!" She was allowed to go, with an



admonition. She was repeatedly called before
the Ladies' Board to answer for some departure
from custom, but she always defended herself
with modesty and finnness, and she generally
came off victorious.

She was always ready to lend a helping hand
to any fellow-student who needed it. She
darned the young men's stockings, mended
their clothes, and gave them sisterlj' sympathy
and good counsel. Old men still living speak
with gratitude of her defending them from
ridicule anfl taking them comfortingly under
her wing when they were uncouth country
boys, new to the college and its ways. I\Iany
yellow old letters from her classmates, both
men and women, testify to the deep impres-
sion her character made upon them, and the
respect and warm affection that she inspired.

She was small and slender, with gray eyes,
a lovely rosy comjjlexion, and dark brown
hair. Her fine health made her always look
younger than her age. When between thirty
and forty, she was sometimes taken for a girl of
eighteen.

While Lucy was at Oberlin, a beautiful and
gifted girl, named Antoinette Brown, entered the
college, with the purpose, up to that time un-
precedented for a woman, of studying theology
and becoming a minister. In the stage-coach
on her way to Oberlin she was cautioned against
a singular and dangerous young woman named
Lucy Stone, whose radical ideas were the talk
of the college. In spite of this warning, An-
toinette and Lucy contracted a friendship
which was cemented in later life by their marry-
ing brothers. These two girls and a few of the
others wished to pi'actise themselves in discus-
sion, and asked leave to speak in the college
debates. These debates were a regular part
of the course, and the yoiuig women were re-
quired to attend them, in order to furnish an
audience for the young men, but were not
allowed themselves to take part. After a
good deal of hesitation, permission was given
for the girls to have one debate. They ac-
quitted themselves finely; but the faculty felt
that any i)ublic speaking by women was un-
scriptural and improper, and they refused to
let it be continued. The young women then
determined to have a debatmg society of their



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



195



own. There liveil in the village an old colored
woman whose master had manumitted her and
given her money enouf^h to buy a small house.
Lucy had taught her to read. The girls asked
her if they might have the vise of hei- jiarlor
occasionally for a debating soeiety. At first
she was 'doul:)tful, fearing that the society
might be a cover for flirtation: but, \\hen she
found it was to consist of j'oung women exclu-
sively, she thought it nmst be an innocent affair,
and gave her consent. So on the appointed
afternoons the girls would assemble, coming
by different routes and in ones and twos at a
time, that the faculty might suspect nothing;
and then, shut u]) in the little parlor, they
"reasoned high" on all sorts of profound and
lofty subjects. Sometimes they held their
meetings in the woods. This was the first de-
bating society ever formed among girls. Later
Antoinette Brown became the first ordained
woman minister. At the end of her course
Lucy was appointed to write an essay to be
read at the connnencement, but was notified
that one of the professors would have to read
it for her, as it woukl not be proper for a woman
to read her own essay in public. Rather than
not read it herself, she declined to write it.
Nearly forty years afterward, when Uberlin
celebrated its semi-centennial, she was invited,
to be one of the speakers at that great gather-
ing. So the world moves.

Lucy had an enthusiastic admiration and re-
spect for the leatling abolitionists, and heljied
to get up meetings for Abby Kelley, William
Lloyd Garrison, and others, when they lectured
at Oberlin. Mr. Garrison wrote fi'oni (Jberlin
to his wife, August 28, 1847: "Among others
with whom I have become acquainted is Mi.ss
Lucy Stone, who has just graduatetl, and yes-
terday left for her home in Brookfield, Mass.
She is a very superior young woman, and has
a soul as free as the air, and is preparing to go
forth as a lecturer, ]&gt;articularly in vindication
of the rights of women. Her coiu-se here has
been very firm and independent, and she has
caused no small uneasiness to the sjiirit of sec-
tarianism in the institution." Yet, in spite of
all the uneasiness her progressive ideas caused
them, she was a favorite with both faculty and
students. As one of the professors said to her.



vears after, " You know we alwavs liked you,
Lucy."

Lucy Stone was the first woman in Massa-
chusetts to take a college degree. She gave
her first woman's rights lecture the same year,
in the pulpit of her brothei''s church at Gard-
ner, Mass. Soon after, she was engaged to
lecture regularly for the Anti-slavery Society.
Public sentiment in New England at that time
was intensely pro-slavery, and the idea of equal
rights for women was even more unpopular
than that of freedom for the slaves. Lucy
shared the hard campaign experiences of all
the other early apostles. Once she went to
lecture at Hinsdale, away up among the hills.
Samuel May, the agent of the Anti-slaver&gt;'
Society, who made the arrangements for her
meetings, had written to the Unitarian minis-
ter, a.sking him to give notice of the lecture.
When Lucy got there, she found that he was
strongly opposed. He had not given the no-
tice, and would not give it. So Lucy put up
her own posters, as she often had to do, with
a little package of tacks and a stone picked up
from the street. Then she went from house to
house, telling everybody about the meeting
and asking them to come. She worked all day
without food, not having time to stop to eat;
and then, toward evening, toiled up the long
hill to the tavern. The tavern-keeper's wife
was tired ami overworked, with two or three
little children clinging to her skirts. Lucy said
to her: "I nuist have some supper before my
lecture. Get me whatever you can get most
easily, for I am hungiy enough to eat anything;
and I will take care of the children for you
meanwhile." The children were delighted to
come to her, and she told them stories all the
while that supper was jneparing. The tavern-
keeper's wife chopped up meat and potatoes,
and made hash; but in her hurry she forgot to
take out of the chopping-bowl the dish-cloth
with which she had wiped it, and she chopped
u\) the cloth with the hash. At the first mouth-
ful that Lucy took, she found pieces of .the
dish-towef in it. This took away her appetite,
and she could not eat any more; so she went
to her lecture fasting. "The boys threw pajier
wads at first," she said, "but it was a good
meeting, and I got some subscribers for the



196



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Anti-slavery Standard there, who kept on taking
it as long as it was published."

The next day she went on to tlie next little
town, Dalton, and here again she had to jnit
up her own posters. As she was preparing to
post some of them on the bridge, she was fol-
lowed by a lot of boys, who thought it a great
"lark." They regarded it as a most irnprojier
thing for a woman to be lecturing and putting
up hand-bills; and, like the Unitarian minister
at Hinsdale, they were filled with the bitter
opposition to the abolition of slavery which
then pervaded almost the whole of New Eng-
land. So the boys came after her, intending
to tear her posters down. But she turned
around and told them what slavery was — mak-
ing men work without paying them for it, and
selling boys like them on the auction block —
till she got them all on her side, and they \vt
her posters alone. The meeting that night
was in a dirty and disagreeable town hall, with
a great yawning fireplace, paper strewn about
the floor, boys throwing wads, and men swear-
ing. Rows of jeering faces confronted her
when the meeting began; but, as usual, aftei'
she hail spoken a few moments, she saw the
mockery die out of them and attention take
its place.

The history of these two days may serve as
a sample of the work she did for years. Once
a hymn-book was thrown at her head with
stunning force. Once in winter a pane of glass
was removed from the window behind her, a
hose was put througli, and she was suddenly
deluged with ice-cold water while speaking.
She put on her shawl, and continued her lect-
ure. Pepper was burned, and recourse was
had to all sorts of devices in order to break up
the meetings, but generally without success.

The work had also its pleasant side. There
was cordial hospitality in anti-slavery homes,
where all the children loved and welcometl her;
and there was rich and inspiring comnuuiion
with her fellow-reformers, the noblest spirits
of that stormy time. When she visiter! the
old home farm, in the intervals between her
lecturing tri])s, it was always a day of rejoicing
for her brother's children, who found "Aunt
Lucy" the most delightful of playmates. She
thoroughly enjoyed her work, ilespite its hard-



ships. Looking back ujjon it in after years,
she said, " I never minded those hard old tunes
a bit."

She mixed a great deal of woman's righlswith
her anti-slavery lectures. One night, after her
heart had been jxarticularly stirred on the
woman tjuestion, she put into her lecture so
much of woman's rights and so little of abo-
lition that the Rev. Samuel May felt obliged
to tell her, in the most friendly way, that on
the anti-slavery platform this would not do.
She answered: "I know it, but I could not help
it. I was a woman before I was an abolition-
ist, and I mufit speak for the women." She
resigned her ])osition as lecturer for the Anti-
slavery Society, intentling to devote herself
wholly to woman's rights. They were very
unwilling to give her up, however, as she had
been one of their most efTective speakers; and
it was finally arranged that she should speak
for them Saturday evenings and Sundays —
times which were regarded as too sacred for
any church or hall to be opened for a woman's
rights meeting — and during the rest of the
week she should lecture for woman's rights on
her own responsibility.

Her adventures during the next few years
would fill a volume. No suffrage association
was organized until long after this time. She
had no co-operation and no backing, and
started out absolutely alone. So far as she
knew, there were only a few persons in the
whole countrj^ who had any sympathy with
the idea of e(|ual rights for women.

She travelled over a large {lart of the Ihiited
States. In most of the towns where she lect-
ured, no woman had ever spoken in public
before, and curiosity attracted immense audi-
ences. The speaker was a great surprise to
them. The general idea of a woman's rights
advocate, on the part of those who had never
seen one, was of a tall, gaunt, angular woman,
with aggressive manners, a masculine air, and
a strident voice, scolding at the men. In-
stead, they found a tiny woman, with quiet,
unassuming maimers, a winning presence, and
the sweetest voice ever possessed by a public
speaker. This voice l^ecame celebrated. It
was so musical and delicious that persons who
had once heard her lecture, hearing her utter



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



197



a few words years afterward, on a railroad car
or in a stage-coach, where it was too dark to
recognize faces, would at once exclaim un-
hesitatingly, "That is Lucy Stone!"

Old people who remember those early lect-
ures say that she had a wonderful eloquence.
There were no tricks of oratory, but the trans-
parent sincerity, simplicity, and intense earn-
estness of the speaker, adcled to a singular per-
sonal magnetism and an utter forgetfulness of
self, swayed those great audiences as the wind
bends a field of grab's. (3ften mobs would
listen to her when they howled down every
other speaker. At one woman's rights meeting
in New York the mob made such a clamor that
it was impossible for any sj^eaker to be heard.
One after another tried it, only to have his or
'her voice drowned forthwith by hoots and
howls. \\'illiam Henry Channing advised Lu-
cretia Mott, who was presiding, to atljourn the
meeting. Mrs. Mott answ ered, " W hen the
hour fixed for adjournment comes, I will ad-
journ the meeting, not before." At last Lucy
was introduced. The mob became as quiet
as a congregation of church-goers: but, as soon
as the next speaker began, the howling recom-
menced, and it continued to the end. At the
close of the meeting, when the speakers went
into the dressing-room to get their hats and
cloaks, the mob surged in and surroundefl
them ; and Lucy, who was brimming over
with indignation, began to reproach them for
their behavior. "Oh, come," they answered,
" vou needn't say anything : we kept still for
you!"

At an anti-slavery meeting held on Cape
Cod, in a grove, in the open air, a platform
had been erected for the speakers, and a crowd
assembletl, but a crowd so menacing in aspect
and with so evitlent an intention of- violence
that the speakers one by one came down from
the stand and slipped quietly away, till none
were left but Stephen Foster and I^ucy Stone.
She said, "You had better run, Stephen: they
are coming." He answered, " But who will
take care of you?" At that moment the mob
made a rush for the platform, and a big man
sprang up on it, grasping a club. She turned
to him and said without hesitation, " This gen-
tleman will take care of me." He declareil



that he would. He tucked her under one arm,
and, holding his club with the other, marched
her out through the crowd, who were roughly
handling Mr. Foster and such of the other
speakers as they had been able to catch. Her
representations finally so prevailed upon him
that he mounted her on a stump, and stood
by her with his club while she addressed the
mob. They were so moved by her speech that
they not only desisted from further violence,
but took up a collection of twenty dollars to
pay Stephen Foster for his coat, which they
hail torn in two from top to bottom.

When she began to lecture, she would not
charge an admission fee, partly because she
was anxious that as many people as possible
should hear and be converted, and she feared
that an admission fee might keep some away,
and partly from something of the Quaker feeling
that it was wrong to take pay for preaching the
gospel. She economized in every way. When
she stayed in Boston, she used to put up at a
lodging-house on H:inover Street, where they
gave her meals for twelve and a half cents and
lodging for six and a quarter cents, on condi-
tion of her sleeping in the garret with the daugh-
ters of the house, three in a bed.

Once, when she was in great need of a new
cloak, she came to Salem, Mass., where she was?
to lecture, and found that the Hutchinson
family of singers were to give a concert the
same evening. They proposed to her to unite
the entertainments and divide the proceeds.
She consented, and bought a cloak with the
money. She was also badly in want of other
clothing. Her frienils assured her that the
autliences would be just as large despite an
admission fee. She tried it, and, finding that
the audiences continued to be as large as the
halls would hold, she continued to charge a
door fee, and was no longer reduced to such
straits.

She had three lectures, on "The Social and
Industrial Disabilities of Women," "The Legal
and Political Disabilities of Women," and "The
Religious Disabilities of Women." In the
early fifties she gave these three lectures at
Louisville, Ky., to innnen.se auiliences, thereby
clearing six hundred dollars, and was in-
vited to stay and give another on temperance.



198



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



From these four lectures in St. Louis she cleared
seven hundred tlollars.

She headed the call for the first National
Woman's Rights Convention, held in A\'orces-
ter, Mass., October 23 and 24, 1850, and took
a leading part in getting uj) tlie meeting. The
report of this convention in the New York
Tribune converted Susan B. Anthony to woman
suffrage, and led John Stuart Mill's wife to
write for the Westminster Rcrieir an article
which was the starting-point of the equai rights
movement in England. This convention was
also the first that called wide public attention
to the question in this coimtry, although the
attention was mostly in the way of ridicule.
Year after year Lucy took the laboring oar in
getting up conventions and in printing and
selling the woman's lights tracts at the meet-
ings. She was "such a good little auctioneer,"
said one who remembei'ed her well.

On May 1, 1855, Lucy married Henry B.
Blackwell, a yovmg hardware merchant of Cin-
cinnati. His father, a sugar refiner of Bristol,
England, highly respected for his integrity,
had come to this country in 1S32, and in 1837
had gone out to Ohio, with the hope of event-
ually introtlucing the manufacture of beet
sugar and thus dealing a severe blow at slaveiy
by making the slave-grown cane sugar un-
profitable. Before he could carry out this
plan, he died suddenly in Cincinnati, leaving
his wife and large family of young chiUlren
dependent on their own exertions. The mother
and elder daughters opened a school. One of
them studied medicine and became the first
woman physician. Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.
The boys went into business. Henry had
marked talent and energy, great eloiiuence, a
kind heart, antl an unparalleled gift of wit and
fun. He was a woman's rights man and a
strong abolitionist. In consecjuence of th(&gt;
active part he had taken in rescuing a little
colored girl from slavery, a reward of ten thou-
sand &lt;1611ars had been offered for his head at a
l)ublic meeting at Memphis, Tenn. In 1853
he hiid attended the Massachusetts Constitu-
tional Convention at the State Hou.se in Bos-
ton, when Wendell Philliixs, Theodore Parker,
T. W. Higginson, and lAicy Stone s])oke in
behalf of a woman suffrage petition headed b}



Loui.sa Alcott's mother: and he had made up
his mind at that tune to marry JiUcy if he
could. Armed with a letter of introduction
from Mr. (larrison, he sought her out at her
home in West Brookfield, where he fomid her
staiuUng on the kitchen table, whitewashing
the ceiling. He had a long and arduous court-
ship. Lucy had meant never to marry, but
to devote herself wholly to her work. But he
])roniised to devote himself to the same work,
and persuaded her that together they could
do more for it than she could alone. The
wedding took place at the home of the bride's
])arents at West Brookfield, Mass. The cere-
mony was performed by the Rev. Thomas
Went worth Higginson, who afterward left the
ministry for refoim work and the army, and
is now better known as Colonel Higginson.-.

On the occasion of the marriage they issued
a protest against the inequalities then existing
in the marriage laws. It was widely pub-
lished, and helped to get the laws amended.
Mr. Higginson sent it to the Worcester S])}/,
with the following letter- —

" It was my privilege to celebrate May-day
liy officiating at a wedding in a farm-house
among the hills of West Brookfield. The
bridegroom was a man of tried worth, a leader
in the Western anti-slavery movement; and
the bride is (^ne whose fair name is known
throughout the nation, one whose rare intel-
lect\ial qualities are excelled l)y the private
beauty of her heart and lif(\

"I never perform the marriage ceremony
without a renewed sense of the iniquity of our
present system of laws in respect to marriage —
a system by which 'man and wife are one, and
that one is the husband.' It was with my
hearty concurrence, therefore, that the follow-
ing protest was read and signed, as a part of
the nuptial ceremony: and I send it to you,
that others may be induced to do likewi.'^e."

The protest was as follows : —

"While acknowledging our nuitual affection
by ]nil&gt;licly assvuning the relation.ship of hus-
band and wife, yet, in justice to ourselves and
a great principle, we deem it our duty to de-
clare that this act on our ])art im]:)lies no sanc-
tion of nor promise of voluntary obedience to
such of the present laws of marriage as refuse

to recognize the wife as an independent, rational
being, while they confer upon the husband an
injurious and unnatural suiHM'iority, investing
liiin with legal powers which no honorable man
would exercise, and which no man should
possess. We protest especially against tlie
laws which give the husband: —

"1. The custody of the wife's person.

"2. The exclusive control and guardianship
of their children.

"3. The sole ownership of her personal and
use of her real estate, unless previously set-
tled upon her or placed in the hand of trustees,
as in the case of minors, idiots, and lunatics.

"4. The absolute right to the jiroduct of
her industry.

"5. Also against laws which give to the
widower so much larger and more permanent
an interest in the property of his deceased wife
than they give to the widow in that of her
deceased husband.

"6. Finally, against the whole system b}'
which 'the legal existence of the wife is sus-
pended during marriage,' so that, in most
States, she neither has a legal part in the choice
of her residence, nor can she make a will, nor
sue or be sued in her own name, nor inhei'it
property.

"AVe believe that personal independence antl
equal human rights can never be forfeited, ex-
cept for crime; that marriage shoukl lie an ecpial
and permanent partnership, and so recognized
by law; that, until it is .so recognized, married
partners should provide against the radical
injustice of present laws by every means in
their power.

"We believe that, where domestic difficul-
ties arise, no aj^peal should be matle to legal
tribunals under existing laws, but that all
difficulties should be sulimitted to the equi-
table adjustment of arbitrators nmtually chosen.

"Thus, reverencing law, we enter oui pro-
test against rules and customs which are un-
worthy of the name, .since they violate justice,
the essence of law."

Lucy regarded the loss of a wife's name at



marriage as a symbol of the lo.ss of her individ-
uality. Eminent lawyers, including Ellis Gray
Loring and Samuel E. Sewall, told her there
was no law requiring a wife to take her hus-
band's name, that it was only a custom and
not obligatory; und the Chief Justice of the
United States (Salmon P. Cha.se) gave her his
unofficial opinion to the same effect. Accord-
ingly, with her husband's full approval, .she
kept her own name, and continued to be called
by it during thirty-six years of faithful and
affectionate married life.

The account of her later years nmst be con-
densed into a few lines. She and her husband
lectureil together in many States, took part
in most of the campaigns when suffrage amend-
ments were submitted to popular vote, addressed
legislatures, published articles, held meet-
ings far and wide, were instrumental in .se-
curing many improvements in the laws of many
States, and togetfier did an unrecorded and in-
calculable amount of work in behalf of equal
rights. A few years after her marriage, while
they were living in Orange, N.J., Mrs. Stone
let her goods be seized and sold for taxes.
Among the things seized was the baby's cradle;
and she wrote a j)rotest against taxation with-
out representation, with her baby on her knee.
In 1806 she helped to organize the American
Equal Rights A.ssociation, which was formed
to work for both negroes and women, and she
was chairman of its executive committee. In
1869, with William Llojxl Garrison, George
William Curtis, Colonel Higgin.son, Mrs. Julia
Ward Howe, .Mrs. .Mary A. I^ivermore, and
others, she organized the American Woman
Suffrage Association, and was chairman of its
executive committee for nearly twenty years.
She always cravetl, not the post of prominence,
but the post of work. Most of the money with
which the Woman' b -Journal was started in
Boston, in 1870, was raised by her efforts.
When Mrs. Livermore, who.se time was uiuler
increasing demand in the lecture field, resigned
the etlitorship in 1872, Mrs. Stone and her hus-
band took cliarge of the paper, and ediletl it
from that time forth. Since her deatli it has
been edited by her husband and daughter. In
her latter years she was nmch continetl at home
by rheumatism, but worked for suffrage at her

desk as diligently as she usetl to do upon the
platform. To the end of her life, despite her
infirmities, she did more jnihlic speaking than
most younger women. Her sweet, motherly
face, under its white cap, wa.s dear to the
eyes of audiences at sufTrage gatherings, and
it was said of her that she looked like "the
grandmother of all the good children."

She was an excellent housekeeper, of the
old New England type. She dri^d all the
herbs, and put up all tlie fruits in their season.
She prepared her own dried beef, made her
own yeast, her own butter, even her own soap.
She always thought the home-made soap was
better than any she could buy. She was an
accomplished cook, and her family were never
better fed than during the occasional interreg-
nums between servants.

All the purely womanly instincts were strong
in her. Even in her old age her ideas about
love were what most peojile would regard as
romantic. She was as fond of a love story as
any girl of sixteen, provided it were a simple
and innocent love story. She was attracted
by all children, dirty or clean, pretty or ugly.
Her face always beamed at the sight of a baby ;
and on countless occasions on boat or train,
during her lecture trips, she helped worried
and anxious young mothers to care for and
cpiiet a crying child. All children loveil her.
What she was to her own daughter no words
can tell.

A friend writes: —

"No one who was privileged to partake of
Mrs. Stone's hospitality could fail U) note her
kindly concern for every one beneath her roof
and for all the ilumb creatures belonging to
the household. But few knew jiow far-reach-
ing was that spirit of kindliness, how many
her motherliness brooded over. Flowers and
fruits were sent from her garden, boxes of
clothing went ^^'est, North, and South, a host
of wonien who came to her in distress were
helped to work or tidetl over hard places. She
gave freely, and every gift was accompanied
by thoughtful care and heart-warmtli. She
was never too busy to gladden the hearts of
the children who came into her presence by
gift of flower or fruit or picture, or by the telling
of a story."



She took keen delight in all the beauties of
nature. As a child, her favorite reward, when
she had done well at i^chool, was to be allowed
l)y the teacher to sit on the floor, where she
could look up through the window into the
shinunering foliage of a grove of wliite birches.

She was \\w most perfectly fearless lunnan
being I ever"knew. J have heard her say that
in the mobs and manifold clangers of the anti-
slavery times she was never conscious of a
(juickened heart-beat. In all the emergencies
of a long life, in accidents, alarms of fire, of
burglars, etc., we never saw her fluttered.
"The gentlest and most heroic of women,"
was her husband's description of her. When,
in 1S93, her strength failed, and she found that
she was suffering from an illness from which
she could not recover, she was perfectly serene
and fearless, and made all her preparations to
go, as quietly as if she wei'e only going into the
next room. As long as she was able to think
and plan at all, she thought for others, and
planned for their comfort. As she lay in bed,
too weak to move, she still tried to save every-
bodv steps, to spare the servants, to see that
guests should be made comfortable, and that
a favorite dish shoukl be prejiared for the niece
who had come to nurse her.

The beyond had no terrors for her. She
said to her tlaughter, with her accent of simple
antl complete conviction: "I have not the
smallest ajiprehension. I know the Eternal
Order, and I believe in it." Something being
s;dd by a friend, v.ho was a Spiritualist, aliout
her possibly coming back to connnunicate with
those she had left, she answered, "I expect to
be too busy to come back." To another friend
she said, "I look forward to the other side as
the brighter side, and I expect to be busy for
good things." To still another, who expressed
grief that she should not live to see women
vote, she answered: "Perhajis I shall know it
where I am; and, if not, I shall be doing some-
thing better. I have not a fear, nor a dread,
nor a doubt."

When a letter from the Women's Press Asso-
ciation was read to her, speaking warndy ot
her work, she said slowly : " I think I have done
what I could: I certainly have tried. With
one hand I made my family comfortable; with

tlie other" — Here her voice failed through
weakness. Uncloubtedly she meant that with
the other hand she had worked to get the
women their rights.

To tlie hist she went on with the same two-
fokl hne of thought, pkmning for the comfort
of her family and the carrying on of the house-
hold after she should be gone, and also ])ianning
for the carrying on of the suflVage work and
of the Woman's Journal, "the dear little old
Woman's Journal,'" as she called the paper
into which she had put so nmch of her heart
and life.

The last letter but one that she wrote was
to a prominent Colorado woman, commending
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt to her, and earnestly
asking her to heli) the passage of the pending
suffrage amendment. The last letter of all
was written to her only surviving brother,
twelve 3'ears her senior. When he came to
see her tluring her last illness, he said to her
with tears, " You have always been more like
a mother than a sister to me."

On October IS she passed quietly away. On
the last afternoon she looked at me and seeniet_l
to wish to say something. J put my ear to
her lips. She said distinctly, "Make the world
better." They were almost her last articulate
words.

Always very modest in her estimate of her-
self, she had told her family that it would not
be worth while to have the' fvmeral in a cliurch:
there would not be enough people who would
care to come. A silent and sorrowing crowd
filled the street before tlie Church of the Dis-
ciples long before the iloors were opened, and
eleven hundred people listened to the tributes
paid her by some of the noblest men and women
of America. By her own wish there was nothing
lugubrious about the funeral: everything was
cheerful and simple. By her own request,
also, the service included the reading of two
poems of Whittier's, containing the lines: —

" Not on a blind and ainiluss way
The spirit goetli,"



and



I know not whure His islands lift
Their fronded palms in air;

I only know I cannot drift
Beyond His love and care."



Even the newspapers, those that had always
opposed equal rights for women, heaped praises
upon her; and a lifelf)ng adversary of hers said,
"The death of no woman in America has ever
called out so widespread a tribute of affection
and esteem."

She had not the smallest thirst for fame. It
has l)een hard to compile any adequate ac-
count of her life, because she kept no record
of her work, never cared to preserve her press
notices, and refused, almost with horror, all
recjuests from publishers of books about "fa-
mous women" to furnish material for a bio-
graphical sketch of herself. She thought it
hardly worth while that any account of her
should ever be written. Yet this very fact,
while it greatly increases the difficulties of her
biographer, is perhaps in itself the strongest
testimony to the spirit in which she did her
work. During her last illness she took pleas-
ure in the following lines, which she had clipped
from some newspaper: —

" Up and away like the dew of the morning

That soais fi-oni the earth to its home in the sun,
So let me steal away, gently and lovingly,
(Jnly remembered by what I have done.

" My name and my place and my tomb all forgotten,
The brief race of time well and jiatiently run,
•So let me pass away, peacefully, silently.
Only remembered by what I have done.

■• Xeeds there the praise of the love-written record,
The name and the epitaph graved on the stone ?
The things we have lived for, let them be our story;
We ourselves but remembered by what we have
done."

ALICE WAKEFIELD EMERSON,
/\ teacher, was born in Oakham, Mass.,
I V May 19, 1840, daughter of Horace
Poole antl Abigail (Pratt) Wakefield.
She comes of good New England ancestry.
Her paternal grandfather, Deacon Caleb Wake-
field, son of Timothy and Susanna (Bancroft)
Wakefield, was born April 18, 1785, at Read-
ing, Mass., and died in that town, March 4,
1876. He married, first, Matilda, tlaughtcr of
Jonathan and Ann (Bancroft) Poole, who was



202



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



born in Reading, Mas.s., June 2, 1786, and died
December 21, 1822. Her mother, Mrs. Ann Ban-
croft Poole, was sister to the Rev. Dr. Aaron
Bancroft, father of George Bancroft the his-
torian. Deacon Caleb AVakefieUl married, sec-
ondly, November 8, 1S23, Nancy Temple, who
was born in Reading, October 21, 1794, and
died there November 18, 1873. Caleb Wake-
field was Captain of the military comi)any;
Selectman, 1830-40; Representative, 1833-36;
Justice of the Peace, 1845-51 and in 1865: and
was chosen Deacon of the Okl South Church,
Reading, August 23, 1821. A man of inde-
pendent thought, persistent in his positions
when once taken, he was pn^gressive, ready to
receive information, and endowed with strong
moral force. His firmness of attitude on most
questions was due to the care with which he
had formed his opinions; once convinced of
their error, no man knew better how to give
up or when to drop the old and take on the
new. It is said that probably for fifty years
no one man did more than he to shape the in-
terests of the connnunity and aid and lead in
the financial, educational, moral, and religious
growth of the town. A good neighbor, wise in
counsel, he was often called to be the adviser
of orphans, young men, and widows; and as
the executor of sacred trusts he often stood
between the living and the dead, well earning
the affectionate remembrance in which his
name is held.

Horace Poole Wakefield, M.D., son of Deacon
Caleb Wakefield by his first wife and father of
the subject of this sketch, was ])orn in Reading,
January 4, 1809. He was graduated at Am-
herst College in 1832. Receiving his medical
degree at Dartmouth in 1836, he first prac-
tised medicine at Oakham, Mass., where he
was Selectman and Town Clerk, and was twice
elected to the Legislature as Representative.
In 1844 he returned to Reading. He was chosen
State Senator in 1862; held the offices of Cor-
oner, Justice of the Peace, Inspector of Alms-
houses at Tewksbury, where also he was phy-
sician; was Superintendent of the State Primary
School at Monson, Mass., for several years;
and chairman of the Reading War Committee
in the Civil War. In 1833 he was a member of
the convention in Philadelphia at which the



American Anti-slavery Society was formed,
and he placed his name on the "Declaration
of Sentiments" next to John G. Whittier. He
was a tlefender of woman's rights and woman
suffrage at the outset of that movement. He
was a councillor of the Massachusetts Medical
Society, president of the Middlesex East Dis-
trict Medical Society, and ex ofjirio vice-presi-
dent of the Massachusetts Medical Society, be-
fore which he delivered the annual address in
1867, an honor given but once in the life of
an individual.

Dr. Wakefield was also president of the East
Hamptlen Agricultural Society, and a member
of the State Board of Agriculture from 1873
to 1882; president of the Palmer Savings Bank
and director of the Palmer First National Bank.
It was said of him that he had the ability to
s?rve the public, was active, energetic, positive,
progressive, with great mental and physical
strength, rare wisdom and foresight in planning,
and persistency in carrying out whatever he
undertook. The bluff manner and blunt speech
which he sometimes assumed covered but
never concealed his genuine kindliness of
heart. In A])ril, 1879, he bought the notetl
"Stonewall Farm" in Leicester, Mass., and
remained there till, his death, which occurred
August 23, 1883. Dr. Wakefield married, first,
March 1, 1838, Abigail Pratt, of Reading,
daughter of Thaddeus B. and Susan (Parker)
Pratt, and, secondly, Mary B. Christy, of
Johnson, \'t.

Alice Wakefield (Mrs. Emerson) was edu-
cated at tlie Reading High School, Mount Hol-
yoke Seminary, and Abbot Academy, Andover,
Mass., from which last named institution she
was graduated in 1862. On Sejitember 30,
1863, she was married to the Rev. Rufus Emer-
son, a Congregational clergyman of Haver-
hill, Mass. Their first home was in Grafton,
^'t., where their only child, Mary Alice, was
born.

Mr. Emerson was educated at Bradford
Academy, Bradford, Mass., and at Amherst
College and Andover Theological Seminary.
Aft(&gt;r leaving V'ermont his pastorates were in
Massachusetts, sometimes in the city and some-
times in the country. He was a practical
idealist, and,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



203



" As a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-tiedged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds and led the way."

In perfect sympathy with her husliaiul, Mrs.
p]merson was of invaluable lielp to him in all
his intellectual ami spiritual work. After his
death, in 1S85, she taught school for several
years in Reading, Monson, Somerville, and in
the day and evening schools of lioston-. In
1897 she was graduated from the Emerson
College of Oratory, Boston, and in 1900 she
accepted her present position as prece])tress of
Emerson College.

Mrs. Emerson's character is marked by high
ideals and quiet but persistent aspiration.
From her father and grandfather she inherits
that faculty of judgment which enables her
([uickly to read individual character, a calm
manner and firm will, with executive ability,
througii which slie has handled many a diffi-
cult situation without friction or injustice, as
plainly shown in her tliscipline in the granmiar
schools in which she taught. In her present
position she has made herself both respected
and loved, and is consistently known for the
tonic quality of her sympathy, which holds the
young people always to fheir best. Two other
characteristics have helped to make her the
confidante of young and okl — the ability tf) keep
a secret and her care not to give unsought
advice. While she never fails to speak to the
point when she does speak, it is often laugh-
ingly said of her that "she knows how to keep
silent in seven languages." Like many other
reserved people, she writes more easily than
she talks. When time jjermits, she lectures
on subjects connected with elocution and
I)hysical culture, and writes short stories.

Mrs. Emerson's modest reserve, coupled with
a natural tlignity, might give a stranger the
impression that she is possessed of a cold
and indifferent nature, but this impression is
dissipated by a glance at the merry eye and
kindly mouth, even before one comes to note
her many kindnesses.

Physically sturdy and active, intellectually
keen and progre.ssive, and spiritually wholesome
and sweet, she is a type of the best product of



New England womanhood, fostered by plain
living and high thinking.

Mrs. Emerson is a member of the Congrega-
tional church, attending Berkeley Temple, Bos-
ton. Mrs. Emerson's tlaughter, Mary Alice,
born in Grafton, \'t., August 3, 1865, is now a
teacher in the State Normal School at Bridge-
water, Mass.



SARAH BROWN CAPRON was born in
Lanesboro, Mass., April 24, 1828. Her
name until her marriage was Sarah
Brown Hooker. Her paternal grand-
father was Thomas Hooker, of Rutland, Vt.,
who was a lineal descendant of Thomas Hooker
of Connecticut. Her grandmother, Mrs. Sarah
Brown Hooker, was a daughter of Lieutenant
Colonel John Brown, of Pittsfield, Mass., who
retired from the army because he distrusted
Benedict Arnold, but who afterward died in
service at Stone Arabia, in New York, in 1780.
Her father was the Rev. Henry Brown Hooker,
D.D., a minister of the Congregational church
in Lanesboro, afterward in Falmouth, Mass.,
greatly honored and beloved. He was a mem-
ber of the State Board of Education, receiving
his appointment from Governor George N.
Briggs. His last work was as the secretary of
the Massachusetts Home Missionary Society,
where he was engaged up to the close of a useful
life. Her mother, whose maiden name was
Martha Vinal Chickering, resided in Boston
before marriage.

Miss Hooker's education was received in
W^heaton Seminary, Norton, Mass., and in the
State Normal School at West Newton. In her
vacations she taught two sununer terms and
two winter terms in the district schools of
Falmouth, on Cape Cod. The State Normal
School was then in charge of Eben S. Stearns,
the well-known and loved Electa N. Lincoln,
now Mrs. George A. Walton, being the able
assistant. Nathaniel T. Allen, afterward long
identified with the Classical School of West
Newton, was the principal of the Model School,
and the pupils of those days well remember his
generous estimate of their abilities as they
passed under his three w-ceks' training. Lu-
cretia Crocker was then a student at the Normal



204

School, giving promise of the efficiency which
afterward distinguished her official career.

Graduating in November, 1850, Miss Hooker
was elected first assistant in the Oliver High
School, Lawrence, Mass., T. W. T. Curtis being
principal and George A. Walton master of the
Grammar school in the same building. Miss
Hooker afterward became an assistant in the
Hartford High School, remaining until April,
1854.

She was married October 1, 1856, to the Rev.
William Banfield Capron, of Uxbridge, Mass.
They were appointed as missionaries of the
American Board to Madura, South India, and
sailed in an ice ship for Madras, November 21,
the .voyage taking one hundred days. On ar-
riving in Madura Mrs. Capron, was put in
charge of the Madura Girls' Boarding School,
now well known in the Madras Pre.sidency as
the Madura Girls' Training and High School.
Mr. Capron during this time was building a
house in Mana Madura, thirty miles ilistant,
to which they removed in 1864, the lady in
charge of the Girls' School having returned
from her furlough in America. Mrs. Capron's
previous service was the prehule to the various
forms of educational work of which she
had charge until 1886, with the exception
of one furlough of two years, from 1872 to
1874.

The work of a foreign miss'onary naturally
resolves itself into two lines. There is the care
for the planting, growth, and development of
the Christian community. This should be
self-propagating and self-sustaining, and to this
end should all training be directed. There is
also the endeavor to uplift all those within one's
sphere of influence. The first step in the for-
mer lies in the little day schools in the villages,
planned to give instruction to the children of
Christians; but these in all cases will include
many more who are drawn by the attractive-
ness of a school so differently conducted from
the sing-song drone of the ordinary school-
master of India. When it is considered that
each station in charge of a resident missionary
comprises from thirty to one hundred villages, in
which are these schools, it will be seen that the
missionary becomes a superintendent of schools.
It is a gala day, indeed, when the missionary



lady comes to inspect the school. On such
occasions there is the selection of the clever boy
or bright girl, whether from a Christian family
or not, to come to the next stage in this etluca-
tional scheme.

Station boarding-schools are at the station
of the resident missionary, and his wife is in
charge. Here are the best pupils from all the
villages, numbering sometimes even a hundred.
Selections from these pass on to the girls' high
and training-school at the central station, and
also to the high school and normal school, or
college for the boys. The theological school
completes the equipment.

Not included in the above, we find the Hindu
girls' day schools and the Anglo-vernacular day
schools for boys, both of which receive pupils
who are shut out from the boarding-schools on
account of caste, yet are eager for education.
Attachments formed in these schools have
proved in after years helpful and delightful.
Many of the boys pass on into government
colleges, and later, becoming officials under the
English government, never forget the teaching
and influence of the missionary lady who
touclu^d their lives in younger tlays.

In October, 1876, in the midst of these ac-
tivities added to all that ilevolves upon the
missionary himself, Mr. Capron was suddenly
called to higher service above. A graduate of
Yale College and of Andover Theological Semi-
nary and for a number of years principal of the
Hopkins Grammar School at Hartford, Conn.,
before its union with the high school, he was
well equipped for his life work. Accurate in
business methods, of rare judgment and sym-
pathetic nature, he was greatly endeared to
his associates. Won by his unfailing kindliness
of manner, the Hindu comnumity revered him.
He originated and established the Madura
Widows' Aid Society, which is a lasting monu-
ment.

In 1876 Mrs. Capron removed to the city of
Madura to superintend the work for women
and girls. Here she remained for ten years,
or until her return to America. There were
three day schools for Hindu girls, and another
was soon added. These four schools provided
for nearly four hundred girls of the higher castes
a blessed retreat from the aimlessness and ig-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

norance of their homes. The government of
India provides generously for the education of
girls, as the Results Grants yearly examina-
tions bring funds to be added to the allowance
from America. Three masters and twelve
school-mistresses were in charge. In place of
a rented, uncomfortable room a new building
was provided for one of these schools in the
midst of Bralmiin homes. The famous temple
covering fourteen and a half acres with its
massive architecture and nine pagodas had its
band of mvisic for the little goddess within
sound of the songs of the girls. Theirs was a
sweeter melody, and more stopped to listen
than ever gave heed to the noisy bang of the
temple performers. High, cool, antl airy, with
a court-yard attractive with ferns and creepers,
it became a resting-place for the women, who
enjoyed seeing the variety of school life.
Phillips Brooks, on entering it during his tour
in India, surveyed the lines of one hundred
girls in their gay clothing and jewels. With
a bright smile he said, "And this is a piece of
Boston!" So foreign was it to the sights in
that great city.

While having the oversight of these schools,
Mrs. Capron felt the claim of the women upon
educational effort imperative. No such pro-
vision as the Hindu girls' day schools having
been made for the mothers in their girlhood
days, they wished that they too might learn
to read. Hence arose a demand for teachers
in the homes. For a woman to be seen going
about the streets and entering houses of tho.se
not her relations was not consonant with Hindu
ideals. There being in those earlier days no
suitable women as teachers except those trained
in mission schools, these were constrained by
the example of the lady missionary to lay aside
custom and give their services to those who
were so ready to receive, and, having taught
the primer, they next gave them the Bible.
Since in many homes they read from the Bible
to those who did not care to learn, but were
glad to listen, they were called Bible wonvm.
There were three of these teachers, or readers,
and thirty women under instruction. Their
number increased to twelve, the number learn-
ing to read to nine hundred and fifty. The
superintendence of these added to her own



visits in the homes was a work full of interest
to Mrs. Capron.

A room in the dispensary was given to Mrs.
Capron, where women and children coming
for medical treatment might- gather. Coming
to India before the days of medical education
for women, but having a liking for the work,
under the leadership of the enthusiastic Dr.
Etlward Chester, she gave two hours each
morning to writing such prescriptions as were
within her ability. Desiring to add something
if possil:)le to render her service in this line more
valuable, she spent six weeks in 1875 in the
Government Hospital in Madras, where the
physician in charge kindly afforded without
limitations such advantages as she most de-
sired. A woman physician is one of the most
potent factors in the emancipation of the
women of India from the fetters of superstition
and cruelty. "I do not expect to be cured,"
said a Brahmin woman who had walked three
miles, " but I wanted to hear the kind words
and feel the pity."

During the fearful famine of 1877-78, when
five millions of the people in the Madras Presi-
dency and the Deccan perished, Mrs. Capron
received for a year and a half a monthly grant
from the Mansion House fund, London, for
famine relief. The tremendous demand upon
one in the midst of such misery must be
experienced to be understood. Generous con-
tributions from America came as timely allevi-
ation to those who long gratefully remembered
the ministry.

One day, as Mrs. Cilpron was threading her
way in antl out among the bundles of grass
brought for sale by the women who were sitting
beside them, she overheard one say to another,
"Who is she?" "Don't you know?" was the
reply, "she is the mother "of the city." Her
conveyance and white bullocks had been in
every street, and had stood at the head of many
a lane. She could always see, in the crowds
through which she was passing, recognition if
not salutation. She had been often told of
the merit she was laying up, with fawning
flattery called a (jueen, and that it was a
goo(_l deed to bring one more religion to add
to the many; but the outspoken testimony
of the humble coolie woman was the un-



206



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



looked-for response to the love for the women
of India.

In 1S86, at the railway station in Madura,
when she was leaving the country, a Brahmin
gentleman, followed by a servant bearing a
large brass tray, made his way through the
crowd, and, coming to the window of the car
where Mrs. Capron was sitting, asked her to
come to the platform. Placing an enormous
wreath of buds of the white jessamine with
touches of pink oleander u))on her shoulders,
he said, "I bring to you this as a token of the
regard of our families for what you have done
for the women of our city."

Not to be ministered unto but to minister,
to be enshrined in the lives of many, a memory
which neither time nor distance can touch,
is ever the sphere attainable by all who seek it.
Arriving in America, Mrs. Capron found her
time fully taken in addresses upon India and
its people and its needs. Articles written for
publication and Bible stutly with resultant
class work also had their sliare of attention.

In 1889 Mr. D. L. Moody, about to open in
Chicago the Moody Bible Institute, a training-
school for home and foreign missions, asked
Mrs. Capron to become superintendent of the
women's department. When she questioned
her fitness for the position, " It is the experience
of life that I want," was his reply. The re-
sults from his far-sighted plan have verified
his expectations: many young men have re-
ceived that which was available in no other
way. Young women who were desiring to
enter church and city work were trained to
know how sympathetically and tactfully to
find their way into the homes and hearts of
those who were weighted with the burdens of
poverty and drunkeimess, and by gracious and
loving words to • kindle hope and courage.
Candidates for foreign missionary work and
ladies at home on furlough from foreign fields
found that which was valuable for the future.
Grateful expressions of conmiendation are com-
ing from all over the world and from ministers
and superintendents in this country, where tlie
services of these trained workers have proved
of value.

Mrs. Capron resigned her position in Chicago
in 1894, and has since resided in Boston with



her sister, Mrs. Arthur W. Tufts. Her children
are: Annie Hooker Capron, now Mrs. Lewis
Kennedy Morse, of Boston, Mass.; and Laura
Elisabeth Capron, now Mrs. James Dyer Keith,
of Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Mr. and Mrs. Morse
have two children: Anna Hooker, born April
5, 1899; and Arthur Webster, born March 9,
1900. Mr. and Mrs. Keith have two children:
•James Monroe, born March 7, 189;?; and Annie
Hooker, born June 29, 1895.



JULIA HAMILTON, now, in 1904, serv-
ing in her fifth vear as President of Wom-
an's Relief Corps, No. 82, of Athol, is
a native of the Isle of Wight. The daugh-
ter of Jacob and Mary Wilkins, she was born
at Knighton, near Osborne Hou.se, August 25,
1845. To escape the shadow of financial mis-
fortune, her parents, in her early childhood,
came to America, and settled in Westmin-
ster, Vi., where she attended the public schools
and acaileniy. At the age of thirteen she be-
came a member of the family of the Rev.
Andrew B. Foster, with whom she lived until
iier marriage, the Foster home being succes-
sively in Westminster, \'t., and Bernardston
and Orange, Mass. Possessing naturally a
considerable talent for music, it was the great
desire of ,Julia Wilkins to become an accom-
plished singer, but her opportunities for in-
struction were limited. Such as she had were
well improved. For many years her voice
was in constant deman&lt;l for service in the
church and on social occasions. Both at West-
minster and Bernardston, Miss Wilkins was
active in work for soldiers of the Civil War,
the incidents and im|)ressions of which fur-
nished much inspiration for later years. Mr.
P'oster becoming pastor of a church in Orange
in 1865, Miss Wilkins at once entered the
church and social circles there, winning, as
in all her previous life, a host of friends. In
( )range she assisted in the welcoming home
of the war veterans of the town. On Octo-
lM&gt;r 22, 1867, she was married l&gt;y the Rev.
Mr. Foster, at the C'ongregational parsonage
in Orange, to Andrew J. Hamilton, then a
resident of Ilin.sdale, N.H. After a short
residence in Hinsdale, Mr. and Mrs. Hamiltonj



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

in the spring of 1869, chose Athol, Mass., as
their field for the work of hfe. Hero they
have since matle their home, its thatches in-
separably interwoven with local history aiul
traditions. For some time after the removal
to Athol, Mrs. Hamilton was an invalid, her
case a hopeless one, it was thought; but a
strong constitution and never wav(&gt;ring covu'-
age at length prevailed, and she again entered
society after practically a ten years' exile.
She was soon in demand in the service of song
and in a variety of social activities. Her
voice, through occasional service, b(Tame fa-
miliar in nearly all the churches of Athol. Mrs.
Hamilton and her husband are members of
the Congregational church, she having joined
the church of that faitli in \A'estminster, \'t.,
and remaining true, though holding her de-
nominational preference subordinate to a broail
recognition of the Christ spirit luider whatever
name appearing.

Mrs. Hamilton, in the privacy of her home,
often recalls the numerous occasions on whicli
she has sung in houses of mourning in West-
minster, Bernardston, Orange, and Athol, feel-
ing that such was perhaps her most helpful
service of song.

In 1888, becoming interested in the prin-
ciples and aims of the Woman's Relief Corps,
she joined Hubbard V. Smith Corps, No. 82,
of Athol, and at once entered actively into its
work, making it a subject of careful study,
but declining rapid preferment, when sug-
gested. In 1890 Mrs. Hamilton was assistant
guard, in 1891 Senior A'ice-President, in 1892
corps Secretary, and in 1893, 1894, and 1895
corps President, bringing to her duties the
qualification of a thorough knowledge of the
work, both as to its spirit, ritual, and methods
of exemplication. Her natural executive abil-
ity, thus put to test, contributed to three
years of successful work. The flag salute,
introduced in the public schools during that
time with flags presented by the corps, has
continued a permanent feature in the schools.
At Mrs. Hamilton's suggestion, made on oc-
casion of her installation as Presitlent in 1895,
and aided her by efforts, Corps No. 82 erected
to the "Unknown Dead" in Silver Lake Ceme-
tery a beautiful granite monument, which was



dedicated at the memorial service. May 30,
1895. The administration of Mrs. Hamilton
was characterized by the loyal and enthusi-
astic support of the corps and on her part
by a desire to rentier impartial recognition
and justice to all. After retiring from the
presidency she continued with unabated zeal
to second the efforts of her successors and in
every way to sustain the work of the corps.
Mrs. Hamilton was Department Aide, 1894-
1897; Department Instructor and Installing
officer in 1898; member of the Dejiart-
ment Executive Board in 1899; and in 1900
serving on the Auditing Committee. During
her three consecutive years in the Depart-
ment Council she was present at every meet-
ing, thus gaining broader and deeper views
of the merit and magnitude of the W. R. C.
work and an appreciation of the noble women
under whose guidance it has prospered. This
experience she deems abundant compensa-
tion for all that she has been able to put into
a work that has conmianded a larger share of
her time and efforts than all other public or
organization work. In 1894 Mrs. Hamilton
was a delegate to the National W. R. C. Con-
vention in Louisville, Ky., and visited the
National W. R. C. Home in Madison, Ohio.
In 1902 she was a National Aide and Depart-
ment Special Aide. During the emergency
work for the soldiers of the war with Spain,
Mrs. Hamilton was chairman of the Executive
Committee of Corps No. 82, and rendereil ac-
tive service. She has also maintained a lively
interest in the Sons of \'eterans work, espe-
cially in the welfare of the local General W. T.
Sherman Camp, which she regards as the lineal
heir to the spirit and traditions of Parker and
Hubbard V. Smith Posts of the G. A. R. of
Athol.

In connection with the Relief Corps work
Mrs. Hamilton has officiated many times as
an instructor and ins])ector of corps and as
installing officer, and has spoken acceptably
on many occasions. She representetl by de-
tail the Department President at the dedica-
tion of the Soldiers' Monument at Plainfield,
Mass., in 1900. In tlie Department conven-
tion of 1900 Mrs. Hamilton received a hand-
some vote for the office of Department Junior



208



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Vice-President; and in the convention of 1901,
endorsed by Hubbiird V. Smith Post, Corps
No. 82, and many others, she receivctl a much
larger vote. In December, 1901, Mrs. Ham-
ilton was for the fourth time elected Presi-
dent of Corps No. 82, l)ut before the date set
for her installation she was stricken with
severe illness, which compelled her resigna-
tion. While in the hospital, slowly recover-
ing from a successful surgical operation, she
was cheered an&lt;l comforted by official words
of sympathy from the Department conven-
tion of 1902 and by the visits and offerings
of many friends, the remembrance of which
she will ever cherish. Having been again
elected President of Corps No. 82 in January,
1903, Mrs. Hamilton resumed active corps
work, contributing to a successful year and
to her re-election and entrance upon her fifth
year as President in January, 1904. Mrs.
Hamilton was also elected a delegate to the
National W. R. C. (Convention of 1903.

She is a member of Banner Lodge, No. 89,
Daughters of Rebekah, and has served two
terms as Chaplain, but, while fully in sym-
pathy with the order, has given little time
to its work because of her devotion to the
W. R. C. and to the Woman's Au.xiliary of
the Athol Young Men's Christian Association.
Of that auxiliary she was President four years
in succession, while the association was strug-
gling to live, the auxiliary contributing its
full share to the success of the struggle. Mrs.
Hamilton is also a charter member of tiie
Athol Woman's Club, organized in 1900; and
at the first meeting of the club .she read an
original paper on "The Relation of the Home
to the School," which elicited favorable cotu-
ment.

In Athol 's first general observance of " Old
Home Week," in 1903, Mrs. Hamilton took an
active part, serving on important conunittees
and presiding over the W. R. C. float, on which
the several States and Territories of the Union
were represented by children with flags and
decorations. On the organization of the Athol
Associated Charities Mrs. Hamilton was cho.sen
vice-president and a member of the connnittee
to draft a constitution and by-laws. At
Athol's union Memorial Day service in 1904



Mrs. Hamilton read a poem on Memorial Day,
written by Mr. Hamilton. In 1904 Mrs. Hamil-
ton served the W. R. C. as Department Aide,
also as a m(&gt;mber of the connnittee on enter-
tainment of the National Convention in Boston
and of the committee on finance.

At the Athol service of mourning for the
beloved President McKinley she read to an
audience of one thousand, in the Academy of
Music, Mr. Hamilton's poetic "Tribute to
William McKinley," with impressive effect.
Notwithstanding all her public work Mrs.
Hamilton's home has not been neglected.
A model housekeeper and home-maker, she
has received from lier husband most cheerful
support in all her philanthropic work.

Their only child, .\ndrew Foster Hamilton,
who was graduated from Amherst College
in 1901, entered the Law School of Harvard
University in 1902.

Mrs. Hamilton is a registered voter on school
matters in Athol, though feeling that the slight
privilege thus accphred is little more than a
farce. She was converted to belief in equal
suffrage by lier husl)an(l, and is a stanch Re-
publican in politics, but not naturally an ag-
gressive suffragist.

Mr. Hamilton was clerk for a merchant
who left his business with his employees to
serve in the Civil War. He was impressed
with the spirit and lessons of the conflict, and
his a.ssociate membership in Post No. 140,
Ci. A. R., attests his desire to perpetuate its
lessons. Mr. Hamilton has been a director
of the Athol Young Men's Christian Associa-
tion from its organization, having also served
as president and treasurer. He is a member
of the Pocpiaig Clul); a Past Orand of Tully
Lodge, No. 130, I. O. O. F., which he has
served many terms as Chajilain; a Past High
Priest of Mount Pleasant Encampment, No.
68; member of Canton Athol, P. M., and of
Banner Lodge, No. 89, D. of R. ; and for thirty
years has taken an active interest in local
public affairs. He has been a fre(]uent con-
tributor to the local ])ress, and his letters to
the Sprinyficld Repuhlimn in support of the
administrative policies of Presidents McKin-
ley and Roosevelt have elicited much com-
ment and some interesting private correspond-

ence. He is also an occusiunal writer of verse,
his "Tribute to AVilliani McKinley" having
brought to hiiu many letters of appreciation,
incluiling acknowleilginents from Mrs. Mc-
Kinley, President Roosevelt, and the Depart-
ment of State. Mr. Hamilton's motto govern-
ing all writings for the iniblic eye is, "To do
somel)ody or some cause some good." In the
family life of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton inde-
pendence of thought has been sacredly re-
specteil, but, happily, there has been har-
mony and mutual helpfulness.



EMMA HUNTINGTON NASON, author
and nuisical composer, is a native
of Hallowell, Me., a pleasant town
on the Kennebec, which is rich in local
and historic interest. She was born August
6, 1845, the daughter of Sanuiel W. and Sally
(Mayo) Huntington. The Huntington family
in America, to which her fathe'r belonged, was
first represented in New England i)y the
widow Margaret Huntington, who came from
England with her children (her husband having
died on the voyage) in 1633, as certified by
the church records of Roxbury. This family
has counted among its members many dis-
tinguished men: one was a signer of the Dec-
laration of Independence: another, one of Gen-
eral Washington's staff: and in U\ter genera-
tions some of them have been well known as
artists, writers, lawyers, and divines.

Mrs. Nason's maternal gi-andfathcr was a
lineal descendant of the Rev. John Mayo, who
was ordained in 1655 as the first pastor of the
Second Church of Boston, where he preached
for seventeen years, and who built the old
historic Mayo-Mather house on Hanover Street
in 1665. Mrs. Nason is also descended in
several lines from "Mayflower" Pilgrims antl
other ancestors who bore their part in early
colonial history.

Emma Huntington (as her name stands on
the school catalogues) was educated at the
Hallowell Academy and at the Maine Wes-
leyan College at Kent's Hill, where she was
graduated A.B. in 1865, that institution lieing
then the only one in New England which
offered a regular college course for women. In



187U she was marrietl to Mr. Charles H.
Nason, of Augusta, an enterprising and success-
ful bu.siness man of refined and cultivated
tastes.

She began at an early age to write verses.
Her first publisheil writings appeared in the
Portland Transcript under a pen-name, and
consisted of short stories, translations from
the German, and verses, which are still
favorably noticed. In 1875 she gave the
connnencement poem before the literary
societies of her Alma Mater, and on Marcli
9, 1880, she read an original poem at the dedi-
cation of the beautiful building, which was
the gift of the citizens of Hallowell to its old
and honored institution, the Hallowell Social
Library. This large and well-selected collec-
tion of books, to which Mrs. Nason had access
from childhood, and to the influence of which
may be ascribed the literary culture of her
native town, she still holds in grateful re-
membrance. The poem, with the oration
delivereil at the same time, was published
in a dainty souvenir volume.

Her first poem published under her own
name was "The Tower," which appeared in
the Atlantic Monthly, May, 1874, and won
ready recognition. Her pen, which since that
time has seklom been idle, was busied chiefly
for some years with .songs of child life, which
appeannl at intervals in such magazines as
St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, antl Our Little Ones.
In 1888 these were collected in a volume
called "White Sails," a title who.se tender
fitness is told in its prelude. These verses are
familiar in .scliool-i-ooms throughout the
country. One in particular, "The Bravest
Boy in Town," tells an incident of the
Civil War, and is everywhere a favorite.
"The Mission Tea Party" gives a pathetic
incident in the siege of Lucknow. "The
Bishop's Visit," "A Little Girl Lost," " Unter
tlen Linden," "Saint Olga's Bell," and the
"Battl(&gt; Song" have been widely copied and
used as recitations. It gives Mrs. Nason the
greatest pleasure that children have loved
and learned her ver.ses.

■■The Tower, with Legends and Lyrics," was
published in 1895 by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.,
and the following comment appeared in the

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Literary World: " Emma Huntington Nason
is one of those wlio write verses by divine
permission. Her poems are not 'merely per-
sonal outpourings of joy or sadness, but they
are thoughtful with the insight that looks
into others' experiences as her own. 'The
Ballad of the Blithe Quartette,' with its
mingled nmsic, the gently swinging 'Slumber
Song," the dignified 'The Tower,' which begins
the book, and the reverently passionate ' At-
tainment,' which closes it, are widely different
from each other in form as in spirit, but they
are all gootl and true, and we are glail they
are ours to read and keep."

The verses "Body and Soul" and "Two
Faces" have been pronounced "two of the
most remarkable poems published in this
country in recent years." The former was
selected by Mr. Warner for his "World's
Best Literature" and "A Child's Question"
was chosen by Mr. Stedman for his Ameri-
can Anthology. Mrs. Nason has done much
work for the literary clubs of Maine, having
prepared papers on "The Folk-lore of Russia,"
"The Abenaki Indians," "The Early Ballad-
ists and Troubadovu's of France," and a course
of lectures on the " Genius and Love-life of
the German Poets." She is an enthusiastic
student of German literature, and has pub-
lished a number of magazine articles on the
German poets.

Her talents are not limited to literature
alone: she is a musical composer, having done
some excellent work, and is active in the mu-
sical circles of Augusta. She is also interested
in drawing and painting. Her studies in oil
have much merit, and she sketches effec-
tively in charcoal from nature. She has writ-
ten a series of articles on "Ancient Art for
Young People."

At Augusta's centennial celebration in 1897
she delivered a poem entitled "Ancient
Koussinoc," into which is woven much of
the historical and legenrlary lore of the
valley of the Kennebec.

Mrs. Nason is a member of the Society of
the Mayflower Descendants and of the Order
of the Descendants of Colonial Governors.
She has been Regent of the Koussinoc Chap-
ter of the Daughters of the American Revo-



lution in Augusta and Vice-Regent of the
Maine State Council, D. A. R.

Mr. and Mrs. Nason have one .son, Arthur
Huntington Nason, who was graduated A.B.
from Bowdoin College in 1899, and A.M.
pro merito in 1903. He has been a teacher of
English in secondary schools, and, since 1902,
a graduate student in Engli.sh at Bowdoin Col-
lege and at Columbia University. He was joint
eclitor of Songs of Theta of Delta Kappa Epsi-
lon, 1899; and his own publications include A
Yule-tide Sonq and Other Verse, 1901, and
jmmphlets on English literature and composition
1901-2-8. He was appointed l^niversity Fellow
in English at Columl)ia for the year 1904-5.



EMMA MYRTICE WOOLLEY, M.D., was
born in Owasco, Cayuga County, N.Y.,
July 8, 1859, daughter of George and
Catherine (Freese) WooUey.
Her ])arents were married in the town of
Aurelius, in the same county, in 1852. Her
grandfather and grandmother Freese were '
of Dutch origin, and were among the pioneer
settlers of Ulster County, New York. When
their daughter Catherine was a small child,
they journeyed to Indiana in a wagon — a
remarkable trip it was considered, that State
being regarded in tho.se days as a part of the
"Far West." After a two years' battle with
fever and ague they returned to the little farm
in Aurelius to spend the remaining days of
their lives.

George Woolley, father of Dr. Woolley, was
born in Cayuga Comity in 1831. He was edu-
cated in the common schools and the Auburn
Academy. He followed farming until 1873.
In that year he sold his farm in Owasco, and
removed with his wife and their three children
to Auburn, where he worked at various trades.
In 1887, having removed to the Freese home-
stead in Aurelius, he resumed his former occu-
pation. He is living in that town at the pres-
ent time, as active as any of his younger
neighbors. Mrs. Woolley, the Doctor's mother,
died May 9, 1900. She was born in 1830. For
several years previous to her marriage she
taught school. Active-minded, energetic, and,
withal, possessed of considerable literary abil-

ity, she was a prolific writer. Several of her
poems and short stories were publislied in the
local papers. Many of her sterling qualities
were tran.sniittetl to her daughter.

Emma M. Woolley enteied the Auhm-n High
School in the fall of 1S75, and was graduated
in June, 1879. Her ambition at this time was
to study medicine, hut women doctors were
not popular with her friends and kinsfolk.
Their opposition anil the fact that her financial
resources were limited caused her to adopt the
more popular profession of teacher. After a
service of six years in the country and vil-
lage schools of Cayuga County she accepted
a position in Americus, Kan., where she taught
two years. She then continued her work as
a teacher in Kansas City. Although a suc-
cessful teacher, faithful in the performance of
her iluties, she never accepted this occupation
as her life work, but with unwavering trust
looketl forward to the time when she could add
to her name the title of M.D.

In the summer of 1888 she returned to her
native town and spent her vacation with i)ar-
ents and friends. In 1890, having decided,
after due deliberation, to carry out her long-
cherished plan of study, she matriculated at
the Boston University School of Medicine.
With only a few hundred dollars, which she
had saved from her salary as a teacher, her
means were limited; and, to eke them out
during the four years necessary to complete
the cour.se, she worked as a nurse many nights
and in vacation. The money thus .earned,
with the small sums furnished by a self-sacri-
ficing mother, enabled her to meet her neces-
sary expenses. In 1894 she was graduated,
and received from the Boston University the
coveted medical diploma.

She at once located herself as physician
at No. 1 Columbus Square, Boston, renting the
house she occupied and doing whatever came
to her hands to do. Although a career of star-
vation was predicted for her by some of her
classmates, she set forth bravely, equip|)ed
with a sound physical, mental, and moral
nature and an indomitable will, l^nboundod
energy and perseverance are the character-
istics by which she has achieved her well-
merited success.



In 19U1 she purchased the house at No. 867
Beacon Street, Boston, removing her office
to this new home, where she gives the best -of
her life to the relief of suffering humanity.



EDNA A. FOSTER, who is editorially
connected with the Youth' t^ Companioii,
being associate editor of the chil-
dren's page, was born at Sullivan
Harbor, Me., opposite Mount Desert hills.
She is the daughter of Charles W. and Sarah
(Dyer) Foster. Her father is an architect
and draftsman, and has been expert estimator
for leading granite companies.

Her ])aternal gramlfather was Jabez Simp-
son Foster, of Sullivan Harbor; and her great-
grandfather in that line was James Foster,
who married Lydia, daughter of Deacon Jon-
athan and Mary (Tracy) Stevens, early settlers
of Steuben, Me. Nancy Stevens, a younger
sister of Lydia, it may be mentioneil, married
William Nickels Shaw, of Steuben, brother
of Robert Gould Shaw, of Gouldsboro, Me.
(Bangor Historical Magazine, vol. viii.).

Miss Foster's paternal grandmother, the wife
of Jabez S. Foster, married in 1827, was Emma
Ingalls, daughter of Samuel" antl Abigail
(Wooster) Ingalls, of Sullivan, Me., and a
descendant in the seventh generation of Ed-
mund Ingalls, an early settler of Lynn, Mass.,
who was the founder of the family of this name
in New England. The line from Ednumd' con-
tinued through his son Robert,^ Nathaniel,'
William,""^ to Samuel," father of Mrs. Emma'
Ingalls Foster. Mi.ss Foster has in her posses-
sion .some silver spoons that were part of the
wedding outfit of her great-great-grantlmother
Ingalls, whose maiden name was Deborah
Goss. She was the wife of William^ Ingalls.

Captain Ezekiel Dyer, Miss Foster's maternal
grandfather, was a large ship-builder of Mill-
bridge, Me., five miles from Steuben, at the
head of Dyer's Bay. The bay was named for
his ancestor, Henry Dyer, Jr., who came hither
from Cape Elizabeth, it is statetl, with his
brother Reuben in 1768-69. Henry Dyer, Jr.,
was a Ca])tain in the Revolution, stationed at
Machias, Me., and St. John, N.B. {Bangor
Historical Magatine).

Miss Foster's school-days were spent in
Lowell, Mass., where she was graduated from
the high school. She afterward studied at
the Berlitz School of Languages, and spent sev-
eral years in the study of art and outdoor
sketching.

In her teens she sent sonnets to the Boston
Transcrijit and afterward to various magazines,
contributing short stories to the Youth's Com-
panion. In 1896 she assumed the duties of
assistant editor of The Household, eventually
becoming its editor. In 1900 she assumed
her present duties on the Youth's Companion.

Her first book, "Hortense, a Difficult Child,"
was published by Lee &amp; Shepard in 1902. This
book had an immediate sale, and before six
months had been .sent to European countries
and the Hawaiian Islands.

Miss Foster's home is now at Annisipiam,
Mass. She leads a very quiet and retired life,
and is not a member of any club. Her chief
characteristics are a fondness for outdoor life
and the love of children. She has a large call-
ing list of little folks, and most of her leisure
hours are spent with them.

All the agreeable impressions gained in read-
ing Miss Foster's stories are strengthened by
a personal meeting with the author. She is
wholly unaffected, and her simplicity of man-
ner, joined to a pleasing directness of speech,
refreshes one like green pastures ancl still
waters.



SALOME THOMAS CADE ("Clayton
Thomas") was born in Charlestown,
Mass., in 1867. She belongs to a good
old Maine family, whose members have
been prominent factors in the history of the
State. Holmes Thomas, her father's paternal
grandfather, was a Sergeant in Peleg Wads-
worth's regiment in the Revolutionary War.
Her father, Spencer Churchill Thomas, married
Eunice Ann Clayton, of Farmington, Me., anti
just before the birth of their daughter they
moved to Charlestown, Ma.ss. The subject of
this sketch began her education in the ('iuirle.s-
town public schools, subsequently taking les-
sons from private tutors. At an early age she
displayed the gifts of harmony and improvisa-



tion, and long before she knew a note on the
piano was an object of interest to those who
watched her childish fingers unerringly extract
melodies from the keys. Subsequently devel-
oping talent as a vocalist, at the early age of
fourteen she toured with an opera company
appearing in several leading parts. At the age
of twenty she was travelling as a member of
the Balfe Opera Company of New York, with
which she scored her chief success as Lady
Harriett in "Martha." Later she spent four
years touring under the auspices of the Red-
path Lyceum Bureau.

Feeling a strong desire to gather laurels in
the field of musical composition, she became
a diligent student in the higher departments
of music, studying in London with Randegger
(under whom she did her first work in compo-
sition) and with Henschel. In Paris and in
Belgium she is a great favorite. She has a
high soprano voice of great purity and sweet-
ness.

In 1894 Miss Thomas began composing con-
cert songs, and in 1900 she began publishing
them in London. While residing in that city
she studied composition and harmony at the
Guild Hall, under Professor Gadsby. She also
instructed pupils on the piano, finding a some-
what select and congenial field in teaching
ladies who could sing to play their own accom-
paniments.

As among the most pleasant experiences con-
nected with her foreign travels she recalls her
stay in Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands.
Yet there were incidents connectetl with her
visit to Wales which render it memorable. Her
father's family being formerly dwellers in the
south of Wales, she took a special pleasure in
learning the language, songs, antl folk-lore of the
country. While visiting the old Malvern par-
ish church, which Jenny Lind used to attend,
and to which she was a most generous con-
tributor. Miss Thomas noticed that, while
many others had been honored with memorial
windows and tablets, there was nothing to
signify remendirance of her. The man in
charge, questionetl as to the reason of tliis
strange omission, replied that he supposed
"nobody had ever thought about it." Miss
Thomas took pleasure in placing a wreath of



REPRESENTATR'E WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

laurel and a flag on tlie grave of the great artist,
and, making a donation, asked the man to place
a contribution-box upon the walls, with a
printed request, inviting visitors to assist in
procuring a tardy memorial to the wonderful
songstress and noble, pure-hearted woman.

They were Welsh frienils who urged Miss
Thomas to publish the Japanese Love Song,
which so impressed Mr. Boosey, of London, the
great music publisher, that he requested all
her work. This song was enthusiastically re-
ceived by the nuisical world, and i-eached the
sale of twenty thousand the first year. The
composer has since pviblished "The Mechanical
Doll," Eugene Field's "Toy Land," "Wing
Tee Wee," "Jai)anese Dance" (for string or-
chestra), now being used in the London ])rotluc-
tion of "The Darling of the Gods," also an
Ave Maria, which has been enthusiastically re-
ceived in London, "My French Lesson," and
"Chasing Butterflies." In Leipsic, with Bos-
worth, she published "Peace on Earth," a
Christmas song, the words of which she wrote
under the name of "Eaton Churchill." Her
usual professional pseuilonym, " Clayton
Thomas," is a combination of both her father's
and mother's family names. She is now busy
on other works, but does nothing hurriedly;
and surely her music is original and choice
enough to be well worth waiting for.

In September, 1902, MLss Thomas married
George Lyman Cade, of Cambridge, Mass.
After residing for some time in Boston, Mr. and
Mrs. Caile removed to their present home in
Melrose. They have one child, a daughter,
Margaret Salome, who was born in Melrose,
October 28, 1903.

Mrs. Cade is a member of the Protestant Epis-
copal church. She belongs to Paul .Jones C'hap-
ter, D. A. R., and was for many years a mem-
ber of the Cecilia Club of Boston.

Graceful, almost girlish in figure, of gracious
and unassuming manners, she is a woman of
delightful personality and an interesting con-
versationalist.

Mrs. Cade has recently been giving the Jap-
anese Love Song and dance in native C(jstume
in Boston, receiving marked commendation
from musical critics. In November next, 1904,
she is to appear in London in a series of con-



certs and recitals under the management
of Messrs. Boosey &amp; Co., introducing her own
songs.



ALICE E. WELD WHITAKER, first

/ \ president of the Boston Woman's Press
X .^ Club (organized in February, 1903),
was born at Southbridge, Mass., m
November, 1851, being a daughter of Charles
Winthrop and Lucinda (Richardson) Weld.
She is a direct descendant of Captain Joseph
Weld, who figured prominently in the early
history of Roxbury. She also traces her an-
cestry along other lines to early settlers of
Boston. Mrs. W^hitaker early manifested a
liking for domestic science, both practical and
theoretical, and also for newspaper work.
Opportunities enabled her to gratify and develop
her natural tastes. Her life work has been
therefore along these dual lines, which have
admirably supplemented and assisted each
other, strength and experience gained in one
having increased her ability and usefulness
m the other. In this way she has become
well known as a newspapei' worker and a rec-
ognized authority on much that relates to
domestic life, from cooking and sanitation to
the artistic use of the needle and brush. Her
early education included the regular courses
at the high school in her native town and at
Nichols Academy, Dudley.

Mrs. Whitaker's newspaper work began soon
after her marriage to George M. Whitaker,
A.M., in 1872. For sixteen years she edited
a page of the Southbridge Journal, devoted
to women's interests. This department was
conducted with such ability that it soon won
more than a local reputation, and gave the
Journal a standing as mon; than a mere pur-
veyor of town items. For a year she was the
sole editor of the paper.

In 1886 Mrs. Whitaker removed to Boston
and took a prominent position on the New
England Farmer, of which she edited a page
devoted to women's interests until July, 1903.
This was a strong feature of the paper, and
added much to its popularity. Her editorials
were frequently quoted in other publications.
In addition to this teclmical writing and edit-

ing she did considerable all-round work on the
Neiv England Farmer, at times being responsi-
ble for the editing of the whole pajier. Further
than this, she has done much work for other
publications. For two years she edited the
Health Magazine, which was a marked success
under her management. For several years she
has written a daily article on cookery for a
syndicate of daily papers; for a portion of the
tune this was illustrated. She has also done
much miscellaneous literary work, and has been
a frequent contributor to various other period-
icals.

She was one of the earliest members of
the New England Woman's Press Associa-
tion, in which' she has held all offices except,
the presidency, and she has been frequently
urged to take that. Her services are in fre-
qumt demand on different important com-
mittees of the association. She represented
it one year at the convention of the International
League of Press Clubs, and' has four times been
a delegate to the National Editorial Association,
having twice responded to invitations to pre-
pare papers for its progranunes.

Mrs. Whitaker was invited to prepare a
paper for the World's Fair Press Congress in
Chicago in 1893 on "Three Quarters of a
Century in Agricultural Journalism." This
paper was received with much approbation.
She was also selected for a similar congress
at the exposition at Atlanta.

Her writings have always been popular be-
cau.se they are based on actual experience, and
because they eliminate the purely imaginative
or what is merely theoretical. " If Mrs.
Whitaker said so, it is so " is a fre(|uent comment
about articles which appear over her name.
Her style is marked by clearness, vigor, and
terseness. Her meaning is- always evident,
and no words are wasted in getting at it. This
is a great desideratum in newspaper work.

Mrs. Whitaker's prominence as a writer and
authority on domestic topics has created a
demand for her services in a number of direc-
tions growing out of, but allied to, her special
work. She was at one time employed by the
Bay State Agricultural Society to organize
a series of travelling cooking-schools in coun-
try towns. She plaimed and successfully man-



aged a Household Institute in connection with
the great Food Fair in Boston in 1897. She
is freciuently in demand as an expert judge
at fairs.

Although Mrs. Whitaker's chief claim to
prominence is in her newspaper work, she is
well known as a club woman. The many brill-
iant functions of the New England Woman's
Press Association always give prominence to
its officers, and this prominence has been em-
phasized in her case by the many years that
she has been officially connected with the
association. She was a leading spirit in the
organization of the Winthrop Woman's Club
and its first president. Her experience and
executive ability did much to start it on a
sound basis and to give it a recognized stand-
ing among sister clubs. On her resignation
she was elected an honorary life member.
She was also a member of the Cooking Teach-
ers' Club during its existence, and was one of
the charter members of the Boston Business
League. She served the League as secretary
antl treasurer, and was e'ected an honorary
member. For several 'y^'ifs she has been a
member of the Arts and Crafts Committee of
the State Federation of Women's Clubs.

She is the mother of two daughters: Lillian,
who is now living; and Ethel, who died at the
age of twenty-three. F]thel Whitaker was an
artist of rare promise, who had already won
a recognizeil position in art and been much
com])limented as an exhibitor at the exhibi-
tions of the Boston Art Club and others of
etjual standing. She was a co-worker with
her mother, whose work she illustrated in dif-
ferent daily and other pul)lications. Her pre-
matine death was acknowledged by the critics
to be a less to the art world.

in the household cares of a large family. Her
grandfather, Samuel Gibbon, was the son of
Samuel, Sr., and Lydia (!ibbon, and was born
April 27, 1759, in Dedhani, Mass. He mar-
ried Abigail Colburn, of Dedham, November
25, 1784, and went to Marlboro in December
of the same year. He was a farmer and store-
keeper and a prominent citizen of Marlboro,
being a Justice of the Peace and Representa-
tive in the Legislature. He died January 12,
1833, at the age of seventy-four. His first
wife, Abigail Colburn, died in 1787: his second
wife, Elizabeth Perkuis, died in 1800; and his
third wife, Abigail Cogswell, died March 31,
1826.

William Gibbon, above named, .son of Sam-
uel and his third wife, was born in Marlboro,
Mass., July 25, 1807, being the twelfth of a
family of thirteen children. He was a farmer
and held many town offices. He was presi-
dent of the First National Bank of Marlboro,
also a charter member of the Marlboro Savings
Bank, in which he was a director for many
years. He died November 11, 1890, in the
room where he was born, having lived all his
life in the same house. This house, although
two hundretl years old, is still in good repair.
It has never been mortgaged, and has had but
three owners.

Eunice Wilson, wife of William Gibbon, was
born December 1, 1808, in Peterboro, N.H.
She was married in 1835, and died October
31, 1890, just eleven days before her husband.
Neither of them was ever sick, and both pa.ssed
away from the infirmity of old age. Their
graves are in Brighani (Cemetery, Marlboro,
Mass., very near the old home and on land once
owned by Mr. Gibbon.

Eunice Wilson's parents were \\'illiam^ antl
Dotia (Smith) Wilson. William^ was the son
of Major Robert" Wilson, who came to Amer-
ica with his parents from the north of L-eland
in 1737. His father, William,' settled in
Townsentl, Mass. Major Robert Wilson mar-
ried Mary Hodge, of West Cambridge, and
went to Peterboro, N.H., where he became
a farmer and tavern-keeper. William' Wil-
son also kept a public house, the \\'ilson Tav-
ern, a noted place for assemblies and balls
and public meetings in his day. The house



is still well preserved, and is a well-known
landmark in Peterboro.

James Wilson, another son of Major Robert
and uncle of Eunice, was born in 1766. He
settled in Keene, N.H., and from 1809 to 1811
was a member of Congress, where on account
of his great height (being over six feet tall
and very large in every way) he was known
as " Long Jim."

Abbie Ann Gibbon was married May 20,
1858, to Walter Balfour Bigelow, of Marlboro.
He died March 30, 1872, leaving her with two
small children. Mr. Bigelow was the youngest
son of Gershom Bigelow, of Marlboro, who
was born March 22, 1768, and his second wife,
Eunice Wilder, who was born in Sterling, Mass.,
January 13, 1790.

Mr. Bigelow and his brother Charles were
.shoe manufacturers, having a large factory
in Marlboro, and were the first to make shoes
by what was called " team work." Burnt out
in 1852, they went to New York and made
shoes at Sing Sing, employing prison labor.
They also carried on the same business at
Trenton, N.J., and several other places, in-
cluding Worcester, Mass., where they were
managers of the once large and prosperous
Bay State Shoe and Leather Company, whose
main factory was there located.

Mr. and Mrs. Bigelow had three children
who outliveil their earliest infancy: Lawrence
Gibbon, born November 23, 1866: Ralph Olin,
born July 21, 1868, who dietl in 1871; and
Isabella Francis, born December 27, 1869.

Lawrence Gibbon Bigelow was educated
in the public schools of ^\'{)rcester antl the
Highland Military Academy, where he was
graduated in 1882. He has been a member
of the State militia, having enlisted as a pri-
vate in Battery B, of Worcester, and been
successively promoted till he became Captain,
serving in that rank ten years. He married
Fannie Davis Clark, of Worcester, October
9, 1889, and has one daughter, Gretchen Bige-
low, born November 4, 1890. Isabella Fran-
cis Bigelow was married October 31, 1900,
to Allan J. McFarlane, of Newtonville, Mass.
They have one son, Harold.

Mrs. Bigelow has lived in Worcester for the
past thirty-three years. She is a member



216

of St. Mark's P^piscopal Church. In addition
to her home duties she ha.s found time for many
outside interests. She is a member of the
Worcester Woman's Club and a charter hfe
member of the Worcester Y. W. C. A., also
of the Y. M. C. A. Woman's Auxiliary, in both
of which societies she has held offices. The
presidency of the charitable society known
as the Worcester Branch of the Baldwinsville
Hospital Cottages for Children, its purpose
being to aid that benevolent institution, Mrs.
Bigelow has held for four years and, as indi-
cated above, still holds. For the same length
of time she has served as treasurer of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union of
Worcester, remaining in office at present writ-
ing (November, 1903).



HARRIET AUGUSTA RALPH, Presi-
dent of the Ladies' Aid Association of
the Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts,
is the wife of William H. Ralph, of
Sonierville. She was born in Camden, N.J.,
March 20, 1851, daughter of the late Joseph
Parker and Hannah Elizabeth (Bullock) Myers.
Her father was from Philadelphia.

Through her mother Mrs. Ralph is a great-
great-grand-daughter of Abijah Reed, who,
as recorded in the Revolutionary Rolls of New
Hampshire, was a private in Captain William
Walker's company. Third New Hampshire
Regiment, connnanded by Colonel James Reed
in 1775, and in 1776 was in Captain William
Barron's company, which rendered service
in Canada. The Hillsborough (N.H.) County
History names him as one of the soldiers
who fought at Bunker Hill. He is said to have
held at one time the rank of Corporal and later
that of Sergeant. He died at his home in Dun-
stable, now Nashua, N.H., about the year 1828.
His daughter Hannah married James Wheeler.
Their daughter, Mary Sampson Wheeler, mar-
ried Jabez Bullock; and Hannah Elizabeth
Bullock, tlaughter of Jabez and Mary, married
in November, 1S45, Joseph Parker Myers,
above named.

In 1851 Mr. and Mrs. Myers removed to
Boston. Mr. Myers enlisted in 1861 in Com-
pany G, Eleventh Massachusetts Regiment.



He was commissioned First Lieutenant, and
was in the early campaigns of the Army of the
Potomac. As the result of injuries received
and of disease contracted in the service, he was
honorably discharged in August, 1862. He
was an invalid the rest of his life, being incapac-
itated for active work. When Joe Hooker
Post, No. 23, G. A. R., was fonned in East
Boston, Lieutenant Myers enrolled his name
on its list of members. He vyas a man of ster-
ling principles, and was highly respected by his
associates. He died September 23, 1891, at
the home of his daughter in Somerville. His
grave is in Woodlawn Cemetery, Everett.

Brigadier-general William W. Bullock, who
was prominent in the State militia before the
Civil War and in subsequent years identified
with national interests, was Mrs. Ralph's
uncle. Her mf)ther, who was General Bullock's
sister, was President of the Soldiers' Ladies
Aid Society formed in East Boston in 1871,
which was one of the first societies of the kind
organized in the country. Mrs. Ralph was
a member of that society. In 1882 she joined
the Willard C. Kinsley Relief Corps, No. 21,
of Somerville, as a charter member. Of this
corps she was the second President, subse-
([uently serving as secretary.

In 1886 Mrs. Ralph was elected treasurer of
the Department of Massachusetts, W. R. C.
After serving with efficiency three years
in this responsible position, she declined a re-
election on account of illness, but accepted
office as a member of the Department Execu-
tive Boaril two successive years. In the plans
for the National I'^ncamjiment of the G. A. R.
in Boston in 1N90 Mrs. Ralph actively repre-
sented the Woman's Relief Corps of Mas.saclui-
.setts. She was a delegate at large to the
National Convention in Tremont Temple, and
was a member of the Executive Committee of
Arrangements and of subcommittees. As
chairman of the Finance Committee, she had
charge of several thousand dollars contributed
to the Convention fund iiy the corps in re-
sponse to an appeal for money to provide for
the reception and entertainment of visitors
and delegates.

Mrs. Ral]ih has also been a National Aide,
press correspondent, chaplain, and Junior Vice-

President. AMieu iKimiiiatcd tor the hitter of-
fice, among the many testimonies to her work
and ability was the following by Mrs. Mary L.
Crilnian, Past De]«rtin(&gt;nt President; "Mrs.
Ralph has ably tilled positions of honor in this
department, and, as has been stated, could
have held the highest ofhce years ago hail not
her duty to an invaliil soldier father seemed to
her more imperative. Siie deserves this recog-
nition in coming forward again. She has always
manifested great interest in the work, and we
appreciate her valuable services. She is highly
respected as a noble woman wherever known.
She has always been ready to help in any emer-
gency ; in the past her services were such that
we feel assured that if elected she will be a
worthy leader."

Mrs. Ralph was chosen and, at the conven-
tion a year later, was unanimously elected De-
partment iSenior \'ice-Presiilent ; in accordance
with the custom of the conventions this insures
her election as Department President in 1905.

Mrs. Ralph joined the Ladies' Aid As.socia-
tion of the Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts
soon after it was formed, in 1SS2, serving on the
committee that drafted the constitution and
also as recording secretary of the association.
After holding the office of secretary for three
years, she declined a re-election. A valuable
silver service, suitably inscribed, was pre-
sented her in 1886, accompanied by an en-
grossed testimonial expressing the regard of
the members and their ajjpreciation of her
work. She is now (1904) serving her fifth
year as President.

The object of the association is to co-operate
with the Board of Trustees in promoting the
interests of the Soldiers' Home, assist in fur-
nishing a library, and provide, as far as possible,
such articles as are necessary for the comfort
of tlie inmates. The appointment of finance
committees to solicit memberships and the
issuing of appeals through the papers and by
circulars were the first methods adopted to
enlist co-operation and financial support.
Women who had rendered service in hospitals
and elsewhere during the days of the civil strife,
representatives of the old Soldiers' Home or-
ganization, members of the Woman's Relief
Corps and of other organized charities in Massa-



chusetts, have united their efforts in promoting
the work of the Ladies' Aid Association.

Every week since the home was opened, the
hearts of the inmates have been cheered by their
visits, and by the books, flowers, fruit, and nu-
merous other gifts that they have distributed.
The entertainments given by the association for
the financial benefit of the home have been well
patronized. The Ladies' Aid table, with its
several annexes, furnished by invitation of the
executive connnittee of the Soldiers' Home
Carnival in 188.3, netted five thousand four
hundred ninety-five dollars and ninety cents
to its treasury. The kettledrum arranged for
the evening of February 14, 1884, which was
attended by five thousand persons, and was
recognized by the public anil recorded in the
press as a brilliant social event, added four-
teen hundred dollars. A part of this sum
was expended in the j)urchase of a lot in
Forest Dale Cemetery, Maiden.

In referring to the work of the Ladies' Aiil,
Mrs. Ralph, in an address given at a church
gathering in Sumerville in 1900, said in part :
"The association has borne the entire expense
of caring for the cemetery lot, which amounted
to more than one thousand dollars from 189G
to 1899, inclusive. Through the efforts of the
late Mrs. E. Florence Barker, condenmed can-
non were secured from the War Department
and mounted on the lot at a cost of one
hundred and twenty-five dollars. The monu-
ment of granite was the gift of Mrs. Lyman
Tucker, who was an active member from
the date of organization until her life's work
was completed, ami who remembered the
association in her will.

"In 1885 new steps to Powder Horn Hill,
Chelsea, where the home is located, were built
at a cost of four hundred and five dollars and
forty-five cents, and in 1887 new floors were
laid in the home, for which over one hundred
dollars were appropriated. General Horace
Binney Sargent Hall has been furnished for
religious .services and entertainments. The
a,ssociation assisted in furnishing the additional
building erected in 1890, and in 1898 refur-
nished the surgeon's office with desk, chair,
and other supplies. In 1899 clocks were placed
in three of the larger rooms. Assistance has



218



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



been given in furnishing a library, and the care
of some rooms has been assumed by members
who bear all the expense of this pleasant duty."

At the annual meeting twelve directors antl
twelve visitors are elected, and one of each of
these visits the home in some month during
the year. In order that the duties m;iy be
thoroughly understood, it is required tliat
before being elected to the Board of Directors
a member shall serve as visitor. A fair held
in Horticultural Hall, Boston, in November,
1900, for the perpetual care of the buri;d-lot
above referred to netted three thousand dol-
lars, checks for liberal amounts being received
from Mr. and Mrs. E. S. Conver.'^e, of Maiden,
and generous contributions from other friends.

The Presidents of the Ladies' Aid Associa-
tion have been Mrs. Caroline King, Mrs. Julia
K. Dyer (who served ten years), Mrs. Austin C.
Wellington, Mrs. William A. Bancroft, Mrs.
Augusta A. Wales, and Mrs. Harriet A. Ralph.

The late Captain John (1. B. Adams, in his
last report as presitlent of the Board of Trustees
of the Home (July, 1900), mentioning the
services at Forest Dale Cemetery, Maiden,
on Memorial Day, carried out by Gettysburg
Post, of Boston, under the direction of the
Ladies' Aid, said: "This association has main-
tained its interest in the home \mabated, and
in very many ways has rendered service which
could not be otherwise provided. It has been
a blessing to us since the incorporation of our
board. It surely is, anil I trust will ever con-
tinue to be, what its name implies, an aiil
as.sociation."

Mrs. Ralph is a member of the Broatlway
Congregational Church of Somerville, and is
deeply interested in religious work. She is
also identified with Ivaloo Lodge, Daugliters
of Rebekah, of Somerville, has served as its
treasurer, and declined higher offices that have
been tendered her. She is interested in other
social and charital)le work connected with the
Independent Order of Odd PVllows. Mrs. Ralph
is a member of the Heptorean Club Auxiliary
of Somerville.

The marriage of Harriet A. Myers and Will-
iam H. Ralph, of Boston, took place in May,
1874 They removed to Somerville, and have
continued their residence in that city. Mr.



Ralph is one of the leading Odd Fellows in
Massachusetts, and has been an officer of the
Grand Encampment, I. O. 0. F., and is Grand
Marshal of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.
He was Commandant of Canton Washington,
Patriarchs Militant, of Somerville, at the time of
the comi)etitive drill at Chicago. This canton
there won the second prize, which consisted
of a valuable diamond i)in for the connnandant
and a magnificent banner for the canton. Mr.
Ralph was Colonial of the Second Massachu-
setts Regiment, Patriarchs Militant, in 1891,
and was Chief of Staff of the parade when the
Sovereign Grand Lodge met in Boston in 1894.
He is also a member of the Masonic order.

Mr. and Mrs. Ralph are highly esteemed
by a wide circle of friends. They have had
three children — namely, Joseph William, born
April 11, 1875; H. Florence, born September
22, 1880 — both graduates of the Somerville
High School, and Charles Warren, born August
17, 1877, who died January 9, 1880. Their
eldest son was a j'oung man of talents and abil--
ity that gave promise of a successful career.
His christian fortitude, his manly beaiing and
genial companionship, won for him many friends
in all circles of society. He passed to the life
beyond, SeptcTuber 13, 1903.



ELLEN A. RICHARDSON, artist, was
born in Portsmouth, N.H., being a
daughter of Oren Bragdon and his
wife, Anna H. W. Bragdon. We are
told that the first Bragdons in New Eng-
land came over from England in their own
vessels about the middle of the seventeenth
century, .sailed up York River, and took up
their abode in the town of York, Me. Some
of the land of which they became the owners
has never passed out of the possession of
the family, and it is said to be a matter
of record that no year has elapsed in which
some Bragdon has not been serving the town
in public office.

Mrs. Richardson is the wife of A. Maynard
Richardson, of Boston. She was educated in
public and private schools of Portsmouth,
N.H., and the academy at Fryeburg, Me., pur-
suing special studies in art, in which she made



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



219



great progress. After her marriage her hfe
for many years was devoted chiefly to her
family, the pursuit of art, however, absorbing
mufh of her leisure. She was equally at home
in the handling of oils, water-colors, i)astels, and
charcoal, engaging also in etching and the
decoration of porcelain and clay under the
glaze. Her proficiency in the last nametl
line of work became such that in 1893 she re-
ceived an appointment to serve at the Colum-
bian Exposition in Chicago on the Board of
Awarils, in the Department of Manufactures
from Clay, antl at the close of the fair was ap-
pointed to prepare the official report of the
potteries exhibit. In 1895 she was appointed
to serve on the Jury of Awards in a similar
position at the Atlanta Cotton States Inter-
national Exposition. Also she was the only
woman to sit with the Higher Boartl of Awards
which held its sessions in the Smithsonian
Institute at ^^'ashington.

Her ability to organize and conduct affairs
of magnitude won a .series of successes in popu-
lar and scientific lecture courses and depart-
mental attractions during several successive
seasons of the expositions in Boston of the
Massachusetts Charitalile Mechanic As.socia-
tion and in the home congresses hekl in Boston
in 1896 and 1897.

Appointed during her connection with the
Columbian Exposition as Massachusetts State
President of the National Business League,
Mrs. Richardson founded a State branch thereof.
As President' of the Massachusetts Floral Em-
blem Society, she inaugurated the work of that
society also, and developed it in a most diver-
sifietl manner, resulting in the adoption by the
Society, January 1, 1903, of the Mountain
Laurel as the State flower.

While Mrs. Richardson was carrying out her
aims in these directions, she became profounilly
interested in the long-neglected becjuest of
Washington to the people of the United States,
and from her study of the &lt;iuestion she was
led to inaugurate the movement for securing
a fitting commemoration of the centennial
of Washington's death and a public remem-
brance of his last will and his last gift to his
people.

In warm appreciation of her three faithful



and successful years of service in organizing
and administering the affairs of the George
Washington Memorial Association, friends of
Mrs. Richarilson, visiting the Cave of the
Winds in South Dakota, considered among
the most attractive of the wonders of the West,
selected one of the finest of its beautiful stalac-
titeil chambers, antl dedicated it with cere-
mony as the " Washington-Richardson Me-
morial." It may be noted that on retiring from
the presidency of the Association, Mrs. Rich-
ardson was appointed honorary president, the
first and only honorary officer the Association is
to have.

The United States Geographical Survey of the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington, named
for her an island in the i\rctic Ocean, this being
in accordance with a precedent (established for
her) for the recognition of notable services for
education.

Mrs. Richardson is Cabinet Head of the De-
partment of Art antl Literature of the National
Council of Women, for which she is planning
most comi)rehensive and helj)ful work. She has
been made chairman of a special committee to
collect an exhibit of Art for the session of the
International Council to be held in Berlin, Ger-
many, in June, 1904, and has been aNo ap-
pointed one of the speakers at the Council.
Her sympathies are broad, and with her untir-
ing energy tend to keep her in touch with all
that is best and most progressive in the world
of womanly entleavor.



SARAH Fl'LLER, principal of the Horace
Mann School for the Deaf, is a native of
Weston. Daughter of Hervey and Ce-
lynila (Fiske) Fuller, and a tlescendant of
colonial and Revolutionary ancestry, she was
born February 15, 1836. Growing to womanhood
under the influence of a well-ordered farmhouse
home, she had the advantage of instruction in
the public schools of Weston and Newton and
the Allen English and Classical School of West
Newton.

At the age of nineteen she began her labors
as a teacher in the public schools. Her first
charge was in West Newton, under the super-
vision of the Rev. Cyrus Pierce of honored

memory, the first principal of the first normal
school in the country. In 1857 she entered the
service of the Boston schools. For nearly ten
years she taught in nearly every grade in the
Boylston Grannnar School, under the master-
ship successively of Charles Kimball, William
T. Adams (Oliver Optic), Alfred Hewins, John
Jameson, and Lucius Wheelock. She was
teaching in the Bowditch School, to which she
had been transferred from the Boylston, when,
after due preparation, she was ajjpointed (1869)
the principal of the school in Boston now known
as the Horace Mann School for the Deaf, the
first successful public day-school ever opened
for deaf children. She is still the head of this
school, after over thirty years of service, in
which there has been n« break or friction.

Miss Fuller is a director of the American Asso-
ciation to promote the Teaching of Speech to
the Deaf, and of the Convention of American
Instructors of the Deaf, a vice-president of the
Sarah Fuller Home for Little Children who
cannot hear (named in her honor), a member of
the Massachusetts Teachers' and National Edu-
cational Associations, the National Geographic
Society, the New England Association of
Teachers of English, and the New England
Educational League. She is the author of an
illustrated primer and a set of phonic charts
that are found useful in the schools. She has
written articles for educational publications,
and has delivered suggestive addresses before
conventions.

With Harriet B. Rogers, of the Clarke Insti-
tution at Northam]:)ton, and Dr. Alexander
Graham Bell, with whom she has ever worked
in hearty sympathy. Miss Fuller called the first
convention for teachers of articulation. In
1890 she taught Helen Keller to speak, and,
with Dr. Bell, was instrumental in having
Phillips Brooks open for her a way to spiritual
truths.

That through organized effort parents might
be even more helpful than they had been, Miss
Fuller founded in 1895 a society (the first of
its kind ever formed) known now as the Boston
Parents' Education Association for Deaf Chil-
dren. This organization, of which she is one
of the directors, has proved a most useful ally.
Its latest effort, the preparation of a booklet



giving the history of the Horace Mann School
and its relation to speech and speech-reading,
testifies to her efficient, loving work and that of
her co-workers.

Miss Fuller's labors in private as well as in
public cannot be fully estimated. As one of
n)any incidents that could be told of her indi-
vidual action in behalf of the adult deaf, it may
be mentioned that prominent residents of a
New Hampshire town (Dublin) so appreciated
what she and her special teacher of speech had
done for an adult member of their comnmnity
that they did what they knew would most
please her — gave a valuable present to the
school under her charge.

All of Miss Fuller's labor is imbued with the
faithful, heroic spirit of her New England an-
cestry. And with it all there is a gracious per-
sonality which the home life at Newton Lower
Falls, where she has lived in one house for more
than half a century, as well as the school life,
constantly reveals. As a member for over fifty
years of St. Mary 's Protestant Episcopal Church
in Newton Lower Falls, she has been active in
the Sunday-School and in other work of that
society.

The following is copied from Miss Fuller's
statement relative to Helen Keller, addressed
to the superintendent of public schools: —

The first intimation to me of Helen Keller's
desire to speak was on the 26th of March, 1890,
when her teacher. Miss Sullivan, called upon me
with her, and asked me to help her to teach
Helen to speak ; for, said she, " Helen has spelled
upon her fingers, 'I must speak.'" She was
then within three months of being ten years old.
Some two years before, accompanied by her
mother, Mr. Anagnos, and Miss Sullivan, she
had visited the Horace Mann School for the
Deaf, when her ready use of English and her
interest in the children had suggested to me
that she could be taught to speak. But it was
not then thought wise to allow her to use her
vocal organs. Now, however, that the attempt
was to be made, I gladly undertook the work.
I began by familiarizing her with the position
and condition of the various mouth parts and
with the trachea. This I did by passing her
hand lightly over the lower part of my face and

by putting her fingers into my mouth. I then
placed my tongue in the position for the sound
of i in it, and let her find the point, as it lay
perfectly still and soft in the bed of the jaw,
just behind the lower front teeth, and discover
that the teeth were slightly parted. After she
had tlone this, I placed one of her forefingers
upon my teeth antl the other upon my throat,
or trachea, at the lowest point where it may be
felt, and repeated the sound I several times.
During this time Helen, standing in front of
me in the attitude of one listening intently,
gave the closest attention to every detail; and,
when I ceased making the sound, her fingers
flew to her own mouth and throat, and, after
arranging her tongue and teeth, she uttered
the sound i so nearly like that I had made, it
seemed like an echo of it. When told she had
given the sound correctly, she repeated it again
and again. I next showed her, by means of her
sensitive fingers, the depression through the
centre of the tongue when in position for the
sound of a and the opening between the teeth
tluring the utterance of that sound. Again
she waited with her fingers upon my teeth and
throat until I sounded a several times, and then
she gave the vowel fairly well. A little prac-
tice enabled her to give it perfectly. We then
repeated the sound of i and contrasted it with
a. Having these two differing positions well
fixed in her mind, I illustrated the position of
the tongue and lips while sounding the vowel
0. She experimented with her own mouth, and
soon produced a clear, well-defined o. After
acquiring this she began to ask what the sounds
represented, and if they were words. I then
told her that i is one of the sounds of the letter
i, that a is one of the sounds of the letter a,
and that some letters have many different
sountls, but that it would not be difficult for her
to think of these sounds after she had learned
to speak words. I next took the position for a,
Helen following as before with her fingers, and,
while sounding the vowel, .slowly closed my
lips, producing the word " arm." Without hesi-
tation she arranged her tongue, repeated the
sounils, and was delighted to know that she
had pronounced a word. Her teacher suggested
to her that she should let me hear her say the
words "mamma" and "papa," which she had



tried to speak before coming to me. She
quickly and forcibly said, "nmm nmm" and



puj) pup



I commended her efforts, and



said that it would be better to speak very
softly, and to sountl one part of the word
longer than she did the other. I then illus-
trated what I wanted her to understand, by
pronouncing the word "mamma" very deli-
cately, and at the same time drawing my finger
along the back of her hand to show the relative
length of the two syllables. After a few repeti-
tions, the words "mamma" and "papa" came
with almost musical sweetness from her lips.

This was her first le.sson. She had but ten
les.sons in all, although she was with me at
other times talking freely, but not under in-
struction. The plan was to develop at each
lesson new elements, review those previously
learnetl, listen to all of the combinations she
could make with the consonants as initial and
final elements, and construct sentences with the
words resulting from the combinations. In the
intervals between the les.sons she practised these
with Miss Sullivan. She was an ideal pupil,
for she followetl every direction with the utmost
care, and seemed never to forget anything told
her. On the day she had her seventh lesson
(Aprl 19) she and Miss Sullivan were invited
with me to lunch at the house of a friend.
While on the way there Miss Sullivan remarked
that she wished Helen woukl use the sentences
she had learned, and added that she seemed
unwilling to do so. It at once occurred to me
that the cause of her reluctance was her con-
scientious care to pronounce every word per-
fectly; and so, in the moments I had with her
during the visit, I encouraged her to talk
freely with me while I refrained from making
corrections. This hatl the desired effect. In
going about the house of our friend she asked
a great many ciuestions, using speech constantly.
In the presence of all she told of her studies, her
home, and her family. She also told of a visit
to Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes a short time
before, when she "talked" to him. Noticing
her words as .she spoke, there were but four
which I did not readily understand. The.se I
asked her to spell on her fingers. Her enjoy-
ment of this, her first experience in the real use
of speech, was touchingly expressed in her re-



222

mark to Miss Sullivan on her way home, " I
am not dumb now." In a conversation some
two weeks later with Dr. Bell, Miss Sullivan,
and myself, a still greater freedom in the use
of speech was noticeable. Miss Sullivan fully
appreciated the victory gained, for she wrote
to Mr. Anagnos two months after Helen had
taken her first lesson: "Think of it! Helen
achieved in less than two months what it takes
the pupils of schools for the deaf several years
to accomplish, and then they do not sj^eak as
plainly as she does." Helen's own joy in this
conscious possession of a new power was shown
in the following letter she wrote me a week or
so after she had taken her first lesson. It also
reveals the origin of her ilesire for speech.

South Boston, Mass., April .f. inno.
My dkar ^[iss Filler:

My heart is full of joy this beautiful morning be-
cause I have learned to speak many new words, and I
can make a few sentences. Last evening I went out
in the yard and spoke to the moon. I said, " () moon,
come to me!" Do you think the lovely moon was
glad that I could speak to lier ? llow glad my mother
will be! I can hardly wait for June to come, I am so
eager to speak to her and to my precious little sister.
Mildred could not understand me when I spelled with
my fingers, but now she will sit in my lap, and I will
tell her many things to please her, and we shall be so
happy together. Are you very, very happy l)ecause
you can make so nianj- people happy ? I think you
are very kind and jiatient, and I love you very dearly.
My teacher told me Tuesday that you wanted to know
how I came to wish to talk with my mouth. I will
tell you all about it, for I remember my thoughts per-
fectly. AVhen I was a very little child I used to sit in
my mother's laji nearly all the time, because I was very
timid, and did not like to be left by myself. And I
would keep my little hand on her face all the while,
because it amused me to feel her face and lips move
when she talked with people. I did not know then
what she was doing, for 1 was quite ignorant of all
things. Then, when I was older, I learned to play
with my nurse and the little negro children, and I
noticed that they kept moving their lips like my
mother, so I moved mine, too, but sometimes it made
me angry, and I would hold my playmates' mouths
very hard. I did not know then that it was very
naughty to do so. After a long time my dear teacher
came to me, and taught me to connnunicate with my
fingers, and I was satisfied and happy. I5ut when I
came to school in Boston 1 met some deaf jieople who
talked with their mouths like all other people, and one
day a lady wh" had been to Norway came to see me,
and told me of a blind and deaf girl she had seen in
that far-away land who had been taugiit to speak and



understand others when they spoke to her. This
good and happy news delighted me exceedingly, for
then I was sure that I sliould learn also. I tried to
make sounds like my little ]ilavmates, but teacher told
me that the voice was very delicate and sensitive, and
that it would injure it to make incorrect sounds, and
jiromised to take me to see a kind and wise lady wlio
would teach me rightly. That lady was yourself.
Now I am as ha])py as the little birds, because I can
speak: and perhaps I sliall sing, too. All of my
friends will be so surprised and glad.

Your loving little pupil,

Helen A. Keller.

' From time to time I noted the improvement
of this remarkable girl in the use of speech, and
I am free to confess that one of the great joys
of my life was when, six years after the first
lessons, it was my privilege not only to suggest
her as a speaker for the fifth summer meeting
of the American Association to promote the
Teaching of Speech to the Deaf at the Pennsyl-
vania Institution at Mount Airy, but to see and
hear the successful effort. The speech, written
out by herself on the typewriter, was com-
mittecl to memory antl now repeated without
a mistake.



MAllY ELIZABETH KIMBALL, Past
President of the National Alliance,
Daughters of Veterans, is a success-
ful teacher in the public schools of
Fitchburg, Mass., her native place. The daugh-
ter of General John White Kimball, of that
city, and grand-daughter of Alpheus Kimball,
who was born in Fitchburg in 1792 and dietl
in 1858, she is of the fifth generation in Worces-
ter County and the ninth in Massachusetts
of the family founded by Richard Kimball,
an early settler of Ipswich.

Richard' Kimball came over from England
in 1634, and with his family took up his abode
in ^\'atertowu, but was induced not long after
to remove to Ipswich, where there was need
of a wheelwright.

Thomas^ Kimball, born in Rattlesden, Suf-
folk, England, in 1633, .son of Richard' and
his wife, Ursula Scott, married Mary Smith,
and settled in Bradford, then a part of Rowley,
Mass. Their son Thomas,' born in 1665,
marricil Deljorah Pemberton, antl was the

father of I'^phraiiu/ who married Anne Tenney.
Ephraim,'^ born in Bradford in 1722, son of
Ephraim and Anne, married Mary Wetherbee,
of Lvmenburg, Worcester County, in 1746, and
resided in that part of T^unenburg wiiich is
now Fitchburg. Their son Ephraim," born in
Fitchburg, married Betsey Wliite, of Lunen-
burg, and was the father of Alpheus,^ above
named, grandfather of Mary Ehzabeth" Kimball.

Alpheus Kimball was a scythe-maker, and
carried on business in Fitchburg. He was
a Whig in politics and became a Free-soiler,
being a strong anti-slavery man. He married
Harriet, daughter of Luther Stone, of Framing-
ham, and grand-tlaughter of Josiah Stone, who
was a prominent citizen of Framingham, serv-
ing as Selectman, Town Clerk, Represent-
ative, State Senator, and Councillor. Josiah
was of the sixth generation in descent from
Deacon Gregory' Stone, who, coming to New
England in 1635, settled in Cambriilge. The
line was: Gregory'; John,^ who settled at Sud-
bury; DanieP; Daniel'; Micah,^ who married
.\bigail Stone, of Lexington; Josiah," born in
1724. It is interesting to note that a younger
brother of Josiah," namely, Eliab," born in
1737, was "Parson Stone," of revered memory,
who for more than sixty years was pastor of the
old parish church in North Reading.

The Hon. John White Kimball, of Fitch-
burg, was State Auditor for nine successive
years, having been first elected to that office
in 1891. He has served in various town offices;
as Representative seven terms; on the State
police and as Police Commissioner; as United
States Pension Agent; and in the Treasury De-
partment at Washington, D.C., as custodian
in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
His service in 1846 as marker for the Fitchl)urg
Fusiliers was the begiiming of a military career
which culminated in the Civil War, when his
gallant and distinguished service in the fieUl
won for him the brevet of Brigadier-general
of United States Volunteers, bestowed March
13, 1865. His military record is as follows;
Captain of the Fusiliers, 1855; Adjutant of
the Ninth Massachusetts Volunteer Militia,
1858; Captain of Fusiliers, 1860, going with
this organization into United States service
in 1861. In the army his service was; Captain



in Fifteenth Massachusetts Infantry, July 12,
1861; Major, August 1, 1861; present at Ball's
Bluff; Lieutenant Colonel, April 29, 1862;
commanded the regiment in all the battles of
the Peninsular Campaign, Second Bull Run,
South Mountain, and Antietam; Colonel of
Fifty-third Ma.s-^adiu.setts Infantry, November
10, 1862; mustered December 3; served in
Louisiana, participating in the Siege of Port
Hudson which lasted forty-six days. The term
of .service of his regiment ex])ired September 2,
1863. In January, 1S64, Colonel Kimball was
appointed superintendent of recruiting service
for Worcester County, with head(]uarters at
Worcester. He was one of the earliest Depart-
ment Commanders of the G. A. R. for the
State of Massachusetts.

John W. Kimball married July 15, tSSl,
Almira Melissa Lesure. Four children were
born to them, and three are now living, namely —
Emma Frances, Mary Elizabeth, anil Edward
Franklin. Enuna Frances married April 17,
1S78, Fred William ]']ager. Josephine White,
the fourth child, died September 2, 1881. Ed-
ward Franklin Kimball is a charter member
and Past Captain of Camp No. 28, Sons of
A'eterans, of Fitchburg; and Mrs. Emma
Frances Eager is a charter member and Past
President of Tent No. 8, Daughters of Veter-
ans.

Miss Kimball appears to have inherited from
her father the ciualities which made him a
brilliant soldi^ and a successful statesman.
She became interested in the Daughters of
Veterans when Louisa M. Alcott Tent, No. 8,
was organized in Fitchburg, and .served as
President of tiie Tent in 1892, accepting the
honor of a re-election in 1893. Through her
zealous and untiring efforts No. 8 is known
throughout the State and nation as one of the
leading tents of the order. Miss Kimball
has served the Department of Massachusetts
Daughters of Wterans as Junior ^'ice-Presi-
dent, Senior Vice-President, and in 1899 as
President. Her administration was one of the
most successful in the history of the depart-
ment. Strongly imbued with the spirit of
justice and right, she worked unceasingly for
a just recognition of the Daughters of Veterans
by the Grand Army of the Republic. The



224



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



result was gratifying. At the thirty-fourth
National Encampment of the G. A. R., held
in Chicago in 1900, a resolution which was
presented by John E. Oilman, Department
Commander, was adopted, entlorsing the order
and giving to it the same official recognition as
that previously accorded to the Sons of \'eterans.

The Soldiers' Home work under the direc-
tion of the D. of V. was perpetuated through
her efforts, and has met with success. Am-
bitious to have the "Daughters" accomplish
some work of permanent value in this line,
Miss Kimball made the first donation, which
resulted in establishing a Soldiers' Home fund.
The convalescent ward of the Sokliers' Home
is named the D. of V. Ward.

Miss Kimball was elected National President
of the Daughters of ^'eterans at the convention
in Philadelphia, September, 1899. She or-
ganizetl many new tents, and was indefatiga-
ble in her efforts to promote the welfare of the
order. During her administration the subject of
official recognition by the (Jrand Army of the
Republic was presented to all the departments
of that body in States where tents existed.

"Onward ever, surrender never," has l)een
her motto; and with ever ready hcljifulness
she has brought the sisters of this grand organi-
zation into closer relationship. The daughters
have been led to show the same fraternal spirit
which actuated the "fathers whose record they
proudly revere." The members of the entire
order vie with each other in according to Miss
Kimball thanks for the good work she has ac-
complished.



JULIA ANN BRAY RUSSELL, M.D., was
born in Reading, Mass., March 6, 1847,
daughter of John and Eliza (Holt) Russell.
Her father, a native of Andover, Mass.,
was a pattern-maker by occupation, and noted
for a phenomenal accuracy of eye. In a small
way he was also an inventor. He died at the
age of fifty-six years. The Doctor's mother,
who was born in Reading, Mass., lived to the
advanced age of eighty-seven. Her mother
(the maternal grandmother) was from the
north of Ireland, a devout woman of Protes-
tant principles. Both Dr. Russell's father ami



mother were characterized by great gentleness
of manner, and to the extent of their resources
they devoted themselves to philanthropic work
in their inmiei^liate neighborhood, seldom turning
a deaf ear to the appeals of the unfortunate,
where they could not assist with material aid,
tendering a warm and ready sympathy that
was often of greater value.

The subject of this sketch acciuired her gen-
eral education in the schools of Reading and
under the instruction of Rev. Thomas J.
Greenwood (Father Greenwood) with whom
she studied for four years. One of the recollec-
tions of her girlhood is of falling asleep on
many nights while the maiden aunt under
whom she was reared read to her out of the
Bible and Mr. Garrison's anti-slavery paper,
the Liberator. The solemn cadences of the
Scriptures doubtless neutralized the horrors of
the Liberator, and, luUetl by the sweet voice
of her aunt, she found the well-deserved rest
of the innocent and comi)assionate.

She early gave evidence of a taste for the
profession that she subsequently adopted.
When only fourteen years of age she was often
called ujjon from all parts of the town to sit
up with and care for the sick. From the work
of a nurse to the calling of a physician was,
for one of her bent, a natural step, and after
some years of diligent application to study
she received her medical diploma from Boston
University. Selecting Maiden as her field of
labor, she at once opened an office in that city,
where she has since resided and practisetl.
Starting with a sound theoretical knowledge of
both medicine and surgery, she has since ac-
quired that accuracy of diagnosis and skill in
treatment that comes only after years of actual
practice, and then only to those who are fitted
by nature, inclination, and training for the
healing profession. To these necessary qual-
ities she adds an address that invites the con-
fidence of her patients and a personal character
that commands for her the respect of the com-
numity in which she lives.

Dr. Russell has a collection of anticjues that
includes some specimens of rare interest and
value. Among them is the old flint-lock pistol
carried by General Warren at the battle of
Bmiker Hill, given to her by Mr. Fred Pickering,

a member of the \\'arren family, and a cup and
saucer that were used at a banijuet held many
years ago to celebrate the Boston Tea Party.
A lover of the fine arts, the Doctor possesses na-
tive talent as a painter, and her home on Main
Street, Maiden, is adorned with several i)leasing
and well-executed pictures in oil from her own
brush.

Dr. Russell has not accumulated for herself
any considerable amount of this world's goods,
but her deeds of charity and benevolence,
both in the bestowal of personal service and
the giving of money, have laid up for her a
wealth of gratitude in the hearts of the many
recipients and in her own the reward that
comes to those who have learned that it is
"more blessed to give than to receive." Her
natural kindness is shown in the adoption of
two daughters, one some twenty years ago and
the other within the last five years, antl both
under circumstances that show a mother's de-
votion and love. Dr. Russell is a member of
the Massachusetts Homa-opathic Medical So-
ciety, the Boston Homoeopathic Medical Society,
and various local medical societies. She at-
tends the Protestant Episcopal church of
Maiden.



MARY J. PRESCOTT FADES, the
subject of this sketch, is a daughter
of sturdy old New England blood,
coming from Scotti.sh ancestry.
In the year 1608 was born in Scotland Deacon
John Leavitt, who came to America in 1628
and settled in Hingham, Mass. Of his descend-
ants among the best known are Moses Leavitt,
his .son, antl Dudley Leavitt, his great-great-
grandson, who was so named from Governor
Thomas Dudley, to whom his family was re-
lated. The life of Dudley Leavitt was sjient
in the (at that time not inconsistent) occupa-
tions of teacher and farmer. Though in all he
had not more than three months' schooling,
he was a student by nature and spent every
leisure moment in study, so that at the age of
twenty he was well groun&lt;le(l in all the science
of that day, especially in mathematics, and
able to give instruction in algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, navigation, gunnery, astronomy.



and philosophy. For this instruction he re-
ceived from each |)ui)il the generous tuition fee
of three dollars a ([uarter. At the age of
twenty-two he married Judith Glidden, of Gil-
manton, N.H. They resided in that town until
1806, when he removed to Meredith, N.H.,
wliich was his home for the remaintler of his
life.

With all his teaching and other work, he
found time to make jjractical use of his scien-
tific attainments in the compilation of a
farmers' almanac. His first edition of this was
published in 1797, his last in 1858. He died
in 1851, leaving one edition in the press and
six others in manuscript, a total of sixty-two
continuous issues. He taught some portion of
every year until he was seventy-four, and at
the same time carried on his farm. After his
marriage he studied Greek and Latin, and later
in life Hebrew and several of the modern lan-
guages. He made the calculations for the New
Hampshire and Freewill Bapti.st Registers, and
was the author of several school text-books,
having at the time of his death a work on as-
tronomy nearly ready for the press. He was
the "most robust style of scholar," thinking
that whatever was to be known he must know,
And as Prof. Agassiz saitl, should be painted
with a book in his hand, others filling his
pockets, and knowledge sticking out all over
his tall head. In the only portrait of him in
existence his head and face are very remark-
able for intellectuality and a certain childlike
yet noble dignity. One of his pupils expres.ses
her impression of him as a man who loved
knowletlge and reverenced God.

He had eleven children, five boys and six
girls. t)ne daughter, Jane, .married the Rev.
John L. Seymour, who was a missionary among
the Indians from 1832 to 1846. Another,
Judith, married the Rev. John Taylor Jones,
a missionary at Bangkok, Siam. One son,
Dudley, who was fitted for college by his father,
was graduated at Dartmouth in 1889, and
studied divinity at Andover Theological Semi-
nary, but died suddenly before graduation. A
younger child, Mary, was no exception to the
rest of the family in her ambition to obtain
knowledge, and, after she became a devoted
■wife and mother, always found time in the



226

midst of lier busy household cares to aid ma-
terially, spiritually, and intellectually those de-
pendent upon her. She was blessed witli a
sweet Christian character, antl commanded the
respect antl love of all who knew her. About
the year 1837 she married Josiah S. Prescott,
of Meredith, N.H., whose occupation was that
of farmer and carpenter. Mr. Prescott was al-
ways active in the public welfare, serving the
town on the Board of Selectmen and satisfac-
torily representing his district in the State
Legislature. They had four boys and two
girls.

The fourth child and oldest daughter of
Josiah S. and Mary (Leavitt) Prescott is the
one whose name heads the present article.
Mary J. Prescott was born in Meredith, N.H.
As a mere child she displayed great talent for
music, shown in her ability to read unfamiliar
compositions with correctness of tune and
tune. The advantages of a musical education
were not sufficiently appreciated as com|)ared
with the more practical and utilitarian attain-
ments. Consequently her training was con-
fined to patient and persistent individual effort
and the annual winter singing-school. A\'hile
living at home she was a valued memlier of the
church choir, and later she acceptably filled
the position of leading soprano in several Massa-
chusetts churches, being also for a number of
years an active member of the Handel and
Haydn Society of Boston, Mass. Although her
instruction on the pianoforte was very limited,
she mastered some of the most difficult music.
Naturally an earnest and ajjt student, she com-
pleted her education at Tilton (N.H.) Seminary,
and taught successfully in the district schools of
her native State. It may here be said that
one of the most pleasant experiences in her
etlucational life was the two years spent as a
pupil in the Emerson College of Oratory, Bos-
ton, Mass.

In .seeking the.se higher attainments she did
not lose her interest in the affairs of every-day
life, but has continued to manifest that adapta-
bility which enables one to accomplish what
the hand finds to do. Her life from childhood
has seemed one continuous effort and sacrifice
for others. In the year LS71 she was called to
a position in Boston, and a few years later she



married John G. Fales, of Thomaston, Me.
From the time of her marriage she has lived
in Boston and vicinity, her home since LS92
being in Cambridge, Mass. She was reared in
the Baptist denomination, and afl^iliated with
that church until she became a Christian Scien-
tist. A devoted disciple, she gratefully bears
testimony as follows: "From earliest remem-
brance I longed to express that soul music in
song which would convert the listener. Since
embracing the science of Christianity as given
in the Christian Science text-book, 'Science and
Health, with Key to the Scriptures,' by Mrs.
Eddy, I have in a measure realized that long-
desired soul harmony 'with signs following,'
not only in having been raisetl from invalidism,
but through experiencing its invaluable spir-
itual uplifting. In common with others who
imbibe the spirit of this teaching, it has been
my high privilege to show many the way to
health ancl harmony, leading them to an under-
standing of their true being as children of God.
vSuch work has sought me to such an extent
and the benefit afforded others has been so
gratifying that all other ambitions have become
secondary.



CLARA H. BAGG EVANS, who in
February, 1903, was elected Presi-
dent of the Department of Massa-
chusetts, Woman's Relief Corps,
was born June 2, 1860, in Pittsfield, Berkshire
County, Mass., being a daughter of Edwin
and Catharine (Hull) Bagg. Her father's
great - great - grandfather, David Bagg, was
one of the pioneer settlers of Pittsfield, re-
moving thither with others from Westfield,
Mass., about the year 1763, only a few years
after the building of the first log cabin in
that locality.

The Bagg family have held a continued
residence in Pittsfield from that time to the
present. In the Revolutionary War David
Bagg was a soldier in Captain William Fran-
cis's company, which marched to Albany,
N.Y., January 14, 1776, by order of General
Schuyler; an(l later he was a member of Lieu-
tenant James Hubbard's company, which was
ordered to Manchester on July 18, 1777.

He was not only a sold.*': hiniscU', at the
age of sixty years, but liad five sons in
the service as well. These sons were .loseph,
Martin, Aaron, Phineas, and Daniel. (See
"Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the
Revolution," vol. i.) Martin Bagg, born in
1745, died in 1824. From him the line now
being considered descended through his son
Martin, Jr., to Jedediah Bagg, who married
Clarissa Newton, and was the father of Edwin,
above named, and paternal grandfather of
Mrs. Evans. Moses Newton, fatlier of Clarissa,
was a Revolutionary soldier, serving three
months under Captain Sanuiel Taylor in
1776 and for several short terms in later years
(see History of Deerfield, Mass.).

Mrs. Evans's maternal gramlfather, Oliver
Sculthorpe Hull, was a soldier of the War
of 1,S12.

Her father, Edwin Bagg, enlisted in the
Sixty-first Massachusetts Regiment in 1864
for one year, but on account of the close of
the war received an honoialile discharge at
the end of nine months. Edwin Bagg entered
the employ of Jason Clapp as a farmer in
1850, being then a young man; and he con-
tinued in Mr. Clapp's emjiloy and' that of
his son until his own death, in December,
1894. The mother of Mrs. Evans still re-
siiles in Pittsfield, her native place.

Clara H. Bagg received her education in
the Pittsfield public schools. At the age
of sixteen she became an employee in a large
ilry-goods house. There she soon developed
remarkable business ability, and was i)romoted
to the ])osition of l)ook-keeper anil confidential
clerk, in which tlouble capacity she served
for seventeen years. June 2, 1897, she was
married to David L. Evans, son of Thomas
and Helen M. Evans.

At the age of thirteen she united with the
Methodist Episcopal church, and has ever
since been an active and earnest worker in
its different departments.

In the year 1887 Mrs. Evans became iden-
tified with W. W. Rockwell Relief Corps,
auxiliary to the G. A. R. One year later
she was elected treasurer, holding the position
for eleven years, when she was elected' presi-
dent for the years 1898 and 1899. She was



again elected treasurer in 1900, and still holds
the position. In 1898 Mrs. Evans was a
member of the local executive committee
of the Massachusetts Volunteer Aid Associ-
ation, which did such good work in furnishing
relief and supplies to the soldiers in the war
with Spain.

Mrs. Evans was Department Aide in 1898-
99. She was elected a member of the Ex-
ecutive Board in 1900, Junior Vice-President
in 1901, and Senior Vice-President of the
Department Woman's Relief Corps in 1902.
Elected President of the Department of Massa-
chusetts in February of the present year (1903),
as above statetl, she is devoting her time and
strength to the best interests of the order.



DORA BASCOM SMITH, of Brookline,
first vice-president of the Ladies'
Physiological Institute, has been co-
worker with most of the notable
women philanthropists, reformers, suffragists,
of the day, and has filled various responsible
official positions.

A native of Massachusetts, born in the town
of Palmer, September 18, 1840, tlaughter of
Alonzo anil Clarissa (Keith) Bascom, she comes
of old colonial stock, tracing her paternal an-
cestry back to Thomas Bascom, who came from
England less than twenty years after the land-
ing of the Pilgrims, lived for a time in Connecti-
cut, and thence removed to Northampton,
Mass. Several succeeding generations of the
family resided in the Connecticut valley.
Alonzo Bascom was in business for many years
as a cotton manufacturer in East Jaffrey,
N.H. His sterling (jualities strongly impressed
his daughter, and exerted a marked influence
on her character. His wife Clarissa, mother of
Dora, was the daughter of Daniel^ and Lydia
(Frost) Keith and grand-daughter of Alexander*
Keith, who is mentioned in the History of
Palmer, Mass., as a descendant in the fourth
generation of the Rev. James Keith, the first
minister of Bridgewater, Mass. James Keith
came from Scotland in 1662. He had been a
student at Aberdeen. He married Susanna
Edson, daughter of Deacon Samuel Edson, of
Bridgewater.

Bereft of a mother's loving care at the age
of six years, Dora Basconi early learned lessons
of self-reliance and of unselfishness and us(&gt;ful-
ness to those around her. She was educateil al
Townsend Female Seminary, and at the age
of sixteen she entered her father's counting-
room, where she filled the position of hook-
keeper and confidential clerk until her mar-
riage. To that period, with its varied ex-
periences, she is indebted for her broad and
practical views of life. It is a mistaken idea
that business development in woman blunts
her finer sensibilities: the opposite is the truth.
Like a ))lant whose blossoms are cut freely,
human nature repays in richness and fruitful-
ness for all drafts properly made on its re-
sources; and a woman who has become |)unc-
tilious in business detail has learned to solve
many problems in profit and loss, eciuity, jus-
tice, that must be encountered and .wived in
the same punctilious way in daily life. Dora
Bascom, while in her father's business office,
came in contact with many people, and her
philanthropic spirit early manifested itself in
kindly ministrations to the poor and sick of
the village. When the Civil War broke out,
and the Sanitary Commission was formed in
June, 1861, she joined the ranks of devoted
patriotic women, and worked early and late
for relief of the " boj's in blue."

She was married November 27, 1862, to
Samuel Garfield Smith, a well-known watch-
maker of Boston. Two children, Kate Auzella
and Dexter Munroe, blessed this happy union.

Kate Auzella Smith was married April 23,
1889, to Charles Sunmer Waterhouse. They
live in Brookline, Mass., and have one child,
a daughter named Irma. Mrs. Waterhouse is
a well-known whist teacher.

Dexter Munroe Smith, broker, was for fifteen
years in the employ of F. H. Prince &amp; Co.,
Boston. He married December 19, 1894, Anna
Cogswell, of Ipswich, Mass., where they now
reside. They have two children, Helen C. and
Julian D.

Mrs. Smith was one of the earliest meml)ers
of the Women's Educational and Industrial
Union of Boston, and for many years served
on important committees. She was influential
in agitating the (juestion of the placing of ma-



trons in the police ;?i.ations. She was a charter
member of the New Eilgland Helping Hand
Society and was on its Board of Government
for several years. This opened to her numerous
opportunities for quiet, unostentatious charity.
Many a wronged girl has reason to bless her for
pecuniary help as well as kindly sympathy.

She was on one of the committees of the fair
for Mrs. Charpiot's Home for Intemperate
Women, by which thirteen thousand dollars
was raised. These committees conceived the
idea of forming the Woman's Charity Club of
Boston. Mrs. Smith was one of the organizers
thereof and its first hospital treasurer, holding
the position five years, until obliged to resign
by a protracted illness. She served for six
years as first vice-president of the club.

Of the Ladies' Physiological Institute of
Boston, said to be the oldest women's organi-
zation in America, she has been the first vice-
president for twenty-one years. The object of
the Institute is to bring within the reach of
women, by open lecture platform, in a simple
way, such medical, hygienic, and physiological
instruction as shall lead, by interesting them,
to deeper study and usefuhiess reganling the
health and welfare of those in their keeping.

Some of its charter members who lived to a
ripe old age were bitterly opposed to woman
suffrage, anil the fiuestion was debarred from
its platform and discussions for many years.
As the membership gradually included the
modern woman with advanced ideas, the spirit
of harmony between the elders and the later
members is evidence of the wisdom, judgment,
and tact of its official incumbents. Mrs. Smith
still holds the position of first vice-president,
fre&lt;|uently occupying the chair. None of her
rulings are ever questioned, and a Boston daily
paper says of her, "She is a thorough parlia-
mentarian, and no possible tangle or mix-up
in a meeting can faze her."

Mrs. Smith is also connected with the
Woman's Relief Corps and with the Eastern
Stcar, a Masonic association. Becoming nmch
interested in the woman's suffrage movement
after hearing in the seventies the strong, earnest
words of JuHa Ward Howe and Lucy Stone on
the subject, she innuediately joined the ranks,
and labored in the cause with untiring zeal.

She was treasurer for many years of the Na-
tional Woman Suffrage Association of Massa-
chusetts, and several times went to Washing-
ton as delegate to suffrage conventions.

Mrs. Smith was first vice-president of the
Committee of Council and Co-operation, better
known as the three C's, and in connection with
the late Dr. Salome Merritt was instrumental
in many public reformatory movements.

She generously opened her house two years
for the use of the Boston Political Class, formetl
by the National Woman Suffrage Association of
Massachusetts, for the purpose of giving in-
struction to women in the various departments
of political economy, F]nglish common law,
national and State constitutions, civil service,
elections, nmnicipal affairs, and parliamentary
law.

Dora Bascom Smith has a reputation as a
public reader. She has on several occasions
taken the part of leading lady in private theat-
ricals, and has been instrumental in forwarding
various entertainments, being always reatly
to utilize her talents in response to ever-recur-
ring calls for charity. She was a student of
Professor Emerson, of the P^merson School of
Oratory, but, independently of that training,
she has a style of her (jwn, whose charm lies in
its simplicity and purity, clear, reaching enun-
ciation, and naturalness of ex])ression. She
has given the Institute many delightful sessions,
filling the absence of president or lecturer by
readings or original productions. Her lecture
on "Pearls and Patches," replete with character
sketches and anecdote, made a strong and last-
ing impression.

Her religious views are broad and liberal aiul
practical, rather than .sentimental. She was
a member of the Church of the Unity during
the pastorate of the Rev. Dr. Minot J. Savage,
and enjoyed his intimate acquaintance while
he remained in Boston. The choice booklet,
"Stray Arrows: Selections from M. J. Savage,"
compiled by Mrs. Smith, was published by her
in 1886.

It is a pleasure to record that with all the
outside work Mrs. Smith has accom])Hslied she
has been a thorough housekeeper, true mother,
and faithful wife.

In personal appearance Mrs. Smith is a



quiet, unassuming lady of medium size and
height, with a low, pleasant voice and a pres-
ence that is felt for strength and comfort if one
is depressed and like "oil on the waters" if
untler any undue excitement. The strength of
character indicated in her face she claims for
a heritage.



MATILDA JANE CAMPBELL WIL-
KIN, educator, is of English-Scotch
parentage, anil was born in Har-
rington, Me., where the early years
of her childhootl were passed. As a forecast
of her .scholarly career, she left home at the
early age of eleven to obtain better school
privileges at East Machias. First she at-
tendetl the public schools anil later the Wash-
ington County Academy, located in this charm-
ing little New England village. Entering the
Normal School at Salem, Mass., in February,
1867, Miss Campbell was graduated on Jan-
uary 21, 1869. The following year she went
to Minnesota. She taught three years in the
granmiar schools of Minneapolis, and then
gave up teaching for a while to continue her
studies at the University of Minnesota. She
was graduated in the class of 77, of which she
was valedictorian. • In 1890 she took the degree
of Master of Literature from her Alma Mater,
and more recently she has spent some time
at the L'niversity of Chicago, with a view to
taking the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
She is a member of the honorary society of
Phi Beta Kappa. In 1880 Miss Campbell
attended the centennial of the Sunday-School
in London, as a delegate from Minnesota,
which State she very ably represented.

In 1882 she married the Rev. George F.
Wilkin, of Warsaw, N.Y., later known as the
author of "The Prophesying of Women" and
"Control in Evolution."

Mrs. Wilkin has travelled extensively in
Europe, having been abroad three times. She
studied at the University College in London
and at Gottingen, Germany. She was espe-
cially interested in linguistic studies, and
spent nuich time in perfecting her knowledge
of Latin, Anglo-Saxon, and German. For the
past twenty-five years she has been connected



230



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



with the University of Minnesota, first as an
instructor and later as assistant professor.
She was associate author of an Old-English
grammar, which was used as a text-book at
the University. More recently she has com-
piled a book of English-German idioms, which
bids fair to be u.seil in the high schools of the
State.

Mrs. Wilkin is a member of the American
Philological Association and the Association
of Collegiate Alumna\ Her daily life is spent
in college work, but she keeps up an active
interest in religious and philanthropic mat-
ters. She has l)een a member of Olivet Bap-
tist Church, of Mimieapolis, for more than
a quarter of a century, and for fifteen years
was teacher of the University Bible Class in
this church. She is an active member of the
W. C. T. I'., a life member of the Woman's
Baptist Foreign Missionary Society, and a
member of the Young Women's Christian As-
sociation. She was president of the State
Board of the Minnesota Y. W. C. A. for four
years. Her wider experience in this position
has enabled her to be an efficient helper of the
local Y. W. C. A. at the University, in which
she has been greatly interested from the first.

A woman of fine character, pure life, and
excellent judgment, Mrs. Wilkin is very widely
known throughout the State and greatly re-
spected and loved, both by the students who
have been under her instruction ami l)y
her a-ssociates in college and in society.



ELIZA TRASK HILL was born in the
town of Warren, Mass., May 10, 1840.
Her father, George Trask, a native of
' Beverly, belonging to that branch of
the Trask family founded by Osmond (or Os-
man) Trask, an English immigrant who settled
there about two hundred and fifty years ago,
was a son' of Jeremiah Trask and one of the
youngest of fourteen children, all of whom
lived to adult age and were noted for their
piety and sobriety. After devoting his atten-
tion for some years in his early manhood to
business pursuits, Mr. Trask took up his studies
at Bowdoin College, to prepare for the ministry,
paying his own way. While there he became



conspicuous for his advocacy of the anti-slavery
cause. He was graduated from Bowdoin in 1826
and from Andover Theological Seminary in
1829. His hrst jjastorate was in Framingham,
his next in A\'arren, and his third and last in
Fitchburg, of the Trinitarian Church, a society
that stood for the principles of anti-slavery
and which disbanded as soon as the slaves
were freed. The last twenty-five years of his
life Mr. Trask spent in the effort tq abate the
evil wrought by the use of tobacco. He suf-
fered much persecution for his pronoimced
views, was forbidden the use of the churches,
and ridiculed by his brethren in the ministry:
but he giew more lovely in character day by
day. He died in Fitchburg in January, 1875,
in his seventy-ninth year.

Mrs. Hill's mother, whose maiden name was
Ruth Freeman Packard, was a native of Marl-
boro anil daughter of the Rev. Asa and Nancj'
(Quincy) Packard. Mrs. Packard was born in
the old Quincy mansion, Quincy, Mass., being
a daughter of Josiah^ Quincy and cousin to
Dorothy Quincy, wife of Governor Hancock.

The Rev. Asa Packard was a son of Jacoh^
Packard, who.se father, Solomon,^ was grand-
son of Sanniel' Packard, an early settler of West
Bridgewater, Mass. Solomon^ Packard's wife,
Susanna, mother of Jacob, was a daughter of
Samuel and Mary (Mitchell) Kingman. Her
mother was the daughter of Jacob" Mitchell
and grand-daughter of Experience Mitchell by
his wife Jane, who was a daughter of Francos'
Cook, one of the " Mavflower" Pilgrims.

The Rev. Asa Packard (H. C. 1783) was for
about twenty years minister of the town and
church of Marlboro, being subsequently settled
over the ^^'est Parish of Marlboro, where he
remainetl till May, 1819. After his retirement
he removed to Lancaster, Mass., where his
daughter's marriage took place in 1831.

Mrs. Trask was in comjilete sympathy with
her hu.sband in all his reform work, and was
greatly beloved in the parishes where they
lived. The Rev. (leorge and Mrs. Trask were
the parents of six children: George Kellogg
Trask, now connected with the Indianapolis
Journal as railroad editor: Brainerd Packard
Trask, a Ignited States navy officer, who died
before reaching the age of forty, from the

effects of the war; Josiah (Jhapiu Trask, wliu
at the age of twenty-six was killed in Quan-
trell's raid in Lawrence, Kan.; Ruth (^uincy
Trask, the widow of Lewis Bellows Powell, of
Scranton, Pa.; Eliza Trask Hill; and William
Dodge Trask, who died in infancy.

Mrs. Hill has vivid remembrances of the stir-
ring words of \\'illiam Lloyd Garrison, Wenilell
Phillips, Lucy Stone, and other noble souls
among the early reformers, who were freciuent
visitors at her father's house in her childhood.
The accjuaintance thus formed with Lucy
Stone lasted until Mrs. Stone's death, and is a
precious memory.

She received her education in the public
schools of Fitchburg, and immediately after her
graduation from the high school, in 1856, she be-
gan to teach school in Franklin, Mass. A mem-
ber of the school board imiuired if she had
brought a certificate of moral character, to which
she replied, "All the moral character I have, sir,
I have with nie." A year later she was asked
to take a school in one of the outlying dis-
tricts of Fitchburg. The school was a hard
one to discipline, and the first great test of her
courage came at this point in her career. The
war of the Rebellion was in progress, and in
her district were a number of people who had
been greatly opposed to her appointment be-
cause of her father's abolitionist views, with
which she was known to sympathize, (^n this
account she was refused board in the neighbor-
hood, hut was not thus deterred from taking
the school. For three months she walked daily
six miles to teach the school, and not only were
the unruly children brought into subjection,
but all the parents, including her l)itterest op-
ponent, became her firm friends.

Going to Indianapolis to teach in 18G4, she
went about with Superintendent Shortridge to
grade the schools of that city. Later she taught
for a year in Terre Haute, Ind. Two of her
pupils while teacher of an intermediate grade
in Fitchliurg were Maurice Richardson and
Edward Pierce, the former now the well-known
surgeon of Boston, and the latter recently a])-
pointed Justice of the Superior Court of Massa-
chusetts.

The R(n'. George Tiask was a man of very
liberal ideas; and, when his daughter was asked



to become a memix&gt;r of a company of her town's
people to give amateur theatricals for the ben-
efit of the Sanitary Connnission, he readily
gave his consent. With Mrs. Vincent of the
Boston Museum as teacher, plays were given
throughout the winter, which netted a large
sum. Mr. Trask always attended, by his pres-
ence giving sanction to the entertainments.
The benefit of Mrs. Vincent's teaching has been
felt by Mrs. Hill in after life.

During the Rebellion Mrs. Hill (then Miss
Trask) collectetl money to give a flag to the
Washington Guards of Fitchburg, presenting
it the night previous to their tleparture for the
battle-field, urging the soldiers to fight cou-
rageously for the freedom of the slave. At these
woj-ds the colonel of the regiment took offence,
and in a cruel way denietl that that was the
issue. Brave men defended the young woman,
and a victory for righteousness was scoretl that
night.

AVhen the Soldiers' Monument in Fitchburg
was dedicated, some years after the close of
the war, Mrs. Hill with her two children was
at her father's home. The company, much de-
pleted, passetl by, bearing the tattered flag,
which had been through many battles. The
two children, one representing a soldier, the
other the Goddess of Liberty, were stand-
ing upon the porch of the old home-
steatl. As the company reached the house,
they halted, antl saluted the children; and
Mrs. Hill, from behind the little ones, responded
to the graceful tribute. The colonel before his
death acknowledged his mistake, and apolo-
gized for his rudeness at the time of the flag
presentation.

At the age of twenty-six Eliza Trask became
the wife of John Lange Hill, of Boston. Their
children are: George Sumner Hill, a graduate
of Harvard Medical School: Julia Annie Hill,
a gratluate of Wellesley College, now the wife
of Dr. Frank J. Geib, of A.shtabula, Ohio, a
gratluate of Harvard; and Lewis Powell Hill,
w'ho is in commercial life.

When the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union was organized, over a ([uarter of a cen-
tury ago, Mrs. Hill, who was then residing in
Braintree, was chosen the first president for
Norfolk County. Some official position in that



232



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



society she has liekl ever since. For ten years
she was superintendent of the prison, jail, and
almshouse ilepartinent, and is now superin-
tendent in this department for Middlesex
County and president of the Winter Hill W. C.
T. U. of Somerville.

When the Australian ballot system was in-
troduced in Massachusetts, Mrs. Hill was ap-
pointed by the Prohibition State Committee
to go from town to town with the ap))aratus
illustrating the process of voting under the
new system; and large audiences composed of
all parties came to see and hear. No ojiportu-
nity was. lost by the speaker to remind her
hearers of the inconsistency of allowing a
woman to instruct men in the process of voting
and denying her the right to vote herself.

In 18.S.S Mrs. Hill's residence was in Charles-
town. For two years she had been president
of the Ward and City Committee of Women
Voters, and she was also president of the Bunker
Hill Woman's Educational League, an organ-
ization that was formed in February. Through
the efTorts of this organization alone twenty-
six hundred women were as.sessed, with a view
to taking part in the school election; and a
most vigorous campaign was carried on, women
being stationed at the various registration
places to watch proceedings. The result of
the election was most gi-atifying. Not only
was the whole school board ticket successful,
but the women hatl much influence in bringing
about a change at City Hall. The Independent
Women Voters' party was the outgrowth of
the struggle of 18S8, and until 1896 Mrs. Hill
was the leader of this party. In 1889 the
Woman's Voice and Public School Champion
was first printed. Mrs. Hill became the editor
and general manager, and still retains these
offices.

In 1895 she was chosen State secretary of
the Massachusetts Branch of the International
Order of The King's Daughters and Sons, an
organization having six thousand members in
the State, comprising two hundred and seventy
circles and two hundred and twenty-nine in-
dependent members, and carrying on a most
helpful charitable work. A vacation Home at
Hanson, Mass., which acconunodates sixty peo-
ple, among them many mothers and their little



families, is a State work. The Vacation Home
of The King's Daughters is Gordon Rest. For
eighteen years Mrs. Hill has had personal
supervision of this home. The work increases
year by year, and is the largest undertaking of
its kind in the State.

In 1885 the New England Helping Hantl
Society was formed, its aim being to proviile
at a moderate rate a comfortable home for
young women earning low wages. Of this
society Mrs. Hill was for several years the
.secretary, and for ten years she was its
president. She has aided in many ways in
ameliorating the conditions of working men and
women.

She has always stood finnly for free speech.
On one occasion when a man was denied the
privilege of answei'ing a s])eakei' who had, as
he affirmed, made false statements, she mounted
to the platform and asked that he be allowed
a hearing. So intense was the excitement that
threats of bodily harm were made, but, as she
preserved a perfectly calm demeanor, the ex-
citement was quelled and she was uninjured.

For eighteen years Mrs. Hill's voice has been
heard in pul))it and on platform in the advocacy
of good causes in Massachusetts and other
States. The In(le])endent Women Voters of
Detroit, Mich., were organized hy her efforts.
In Mrs. Hill's evangelistic and Bible services a
simple faith is taught, with a reliance on Christ
as mediator and Saviour.

The result of labor in ])risons and missions
has been most gratifying in the reconstruction
of broken-up homes, in the obtaining of em-
ployment for disheartened men and women,
and in the redemption of those who have be-
come victims of evil habits. Following in the
footsteps of her belovetl father, .she has done
much to help on the anti-cigarette movement,
and has been instrumental in banding hundreds
of young i^eople together to labor in Christian
service. Naturally possessed of a very hope-
ful, cheerful temperament, obstacles which
might seem to others very hard to overcome
have not hindered or discouraged her in the
least. She looks with the utmost faith toward
the time when right shall triumph over wrong
and her native land lie indeed a Christian
nation.

SARAH ANN PRESTON DICKERMAN
(born Ballard) is a native of Boston,
Mass. Her birtliplace was the family
I'esidence, which stood on Washington
Street (formerly Orange Street), the locality
being now the corner of Washington and Davis
Streets, where her mother's grandmother, Mrs.
Zebiah Davis Cowdin, a daughter of General
Amasa Davis, for whom Davis Street was
named, was born in 17N2. General Davis was
one of the Boston merchants who signed the
agreement which led to the lioston Tea Party
of. December 16, 1773. The estate remainetl
in possession of the family until 1892, when it
was sold.

Mrs. Dickerman's father, Joseph Atlams Bal-
lard, was of Dutch blood on the paternal side.
His father, Peter Albertus Von Hagen, came to
Boston to teach music, and was organist of
Trinity Church for many years. He married
Miss Lucy Ballard in ISOO. The ^'on Hagen
children by act of Legislature took their
mother's maiden name, Ballard, Jo.seph H.
Von Hagen becoming Joseph Adams liallard.
Mr. Ballard's ancestors on the maternal side
were New England jieojile, residents for a num-
ber of generations in Btiston and vicinity. The
house in which his grandmother, .Madam Lucy
Adams, lived, as the wife and afterward the
widow of Abijah Adams, her secoiul husband,
is still standing on Pinckney Street.

Joseph A. Ballard up to the time of his
death, October 1, 1858, at the age of fifty-one
years, was marine editor of the Boston Dnily
Advertif^er, associated with the Hon. Nathan
Hale, father of the Rev. Dr. Edward P^verett
Hale.

Mr. Ballard's wife, Mrs. Dickerman's mother,
whose maiden name was Sarah Davis Cowdin
Gamage, died July 4, 1874. She was a tlaughter
of Nathaniel and Sarah Davis (Cowdin) CJamage
and grand-daughter of Daniel Cowdin and his
wife, Zebiah Davis, above named. Mrs. Bal-
lard was early interested in philanthropic work.
She joined the Rev. Charles Francis Barnard
in organizing the Warren Street Chapel, a chil-
dren's church, and devoted many years to this
and other charitable institutions.

Sarah Ann Preston Ballard, now Mrs. Dick-
erman, was born June 13, 1833. She was edu-



cated in the Boston public schools, being for
some years a pupil in the old Franklin School.
She was married February 16, 1853, to Henry
Wilson Dickerman, son of Ezekiel and Marinda
Dickerman, of Stoughton, Mass. Two sons
were born to Mr. and Mrs. Dickerman in the
early years of their wedded life, namely: Joseph
Henry, February 8, 1854; and William .Mont-
gomery, who died soon after his birth, April 10,
1855.

In her girlhood Mrs. Dickerman was much
influenced by the Rev. Charles Francis Barnard,
and in early womanhood she came under the
ministry of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, with
whom she formed a friendship which has been
unbroken. This training determined her choice
of occupation outside of family claims. She
has always chosen to join societies having for
their objects the advancement of humanitarian
ideas or the alleviation of some form of suffer-
ing.

She .seems to have been a born suffragist,
as from early girlhood she rebelletl at any form
of injustice to women, and, although descended
from most conservative ancestors, was always
ready to work for suffrage for women, serv-
ing on the Ward ami City Committee of
Women Voters in Boston with .\bby W. May,
Ednah D. Cheney, Lucia M. Peabody, Dr.
Salome Merritt, and other pioneers in this work.
She has voted for school committee ever
since women were granted the right to do
so, and her interest in school n)atters still
continues.

She has worked in the following named so-
cieties, serving most of them as either presi-
dent, secretary, treasurer, director, or trustee:
Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association,
Massachusetts School Suffrage Association,
Jamaica Plain School Suffrage Association,
Woman's Charity Club, Martha and Mary

UCY BRIGHAM (HOriMER) FISHER
was born in Fitchburg, Mass., March
24, 1S34, the oldest of five ehildreii of
Silas and Delia (Gibbs) Hosnier. Her
early life was in no way different from the aver-
age of the time. Neither wealth nor poverty
was the lot of the great body of the people, and
the ojjportunities for develojjment and progress
were fairly open to every one. She early man-
ifested traits of character — among them a strong
sense of justice and a conscientious regard for
truth — which have since given her power and
influence.

When sixteen years old, Lucy Brigham Hos-
mer, at the solicitation of the school conunittee,
became a teacher in the public schools of her
native town. In this capacity she served with
marked success for the nine years following.
On February 12, 1860, she was mari'ied to Dr.
Jabez Fisher, well known in the horticultural
world. His two motherless children needed
the fostering care which she could give, and
most devotedly tlid she fulfil all the recjuire-
ments of the situation.

Having entered the Sunday-school at the age
of three years, and remained a constant jiupil
until she was twenty, she then began her work
as teacher in the Sunday-school of the First
Universalist Church by assuming charge of
the primary cla.ss of little girls. The gradual
increase of oii|)ortunity which followed her suc-
cessful early experience was of the most satis-
factory nature. From that time to the ]ires-
ent, a period of over fifty years, she has been
a constant and im})ortant factor in the lives
and characters of many hundreds of children.
The primary department has constantly grown
under her management, and, as now consti-
tuted, embraces girls and t)oys from three to
ten years of age; the numbers ranging from
one hundred to one hundred and thirty. In
many cases she has now in charge children
whose father or mother or both parents were
formerly under her instruction and are now
teachers in some department of the school.
On each returning Sunday she has the inspiring
satisfaction of looking (he greater part of these
children in the face, a most beautiful si^ht;
and through her constant watchfuln(&gt;ss and well-
directed efforts she controls, directs, and draws



out their young minds in the direction of truth,
justice, and lovelinei^s of character. She re-
sti'ains all that is wrong, and encourages all
that is good and lovely. It is done so easily
and naturally that the looker-on is charmed by
the smoothness with which everything proceeds,
and is not aware that any sjiccial effort is being
used to this end. The time for closing the ex-
ercises comes all too soon, and many linger to
say pleasant words. She wins the love of most
chiklren at once, and always retains the lasting
respect of even those who are prone to rebel
against her requirements, when they learn that
such are exercised not by an autocrat, but by
a friend whose only consideration is for their
best development in character, and who will
never consent to see them go wrong. One of
her pastors thus emphasizes some of her char-
acteristics : —

"I am reminded, as I think of her, of Mrs.
Fisher's perfect fairness of mind and firmness
in the maintenance of what she deems to be
right. She has no compromise with error or
evil. She is always earnest in her convictions
anfl steadfast in her loyalt)'^ to duty. She never
turns aside for secondary considerations, and
never surrenders. She sees the right clearly,
and devotes herself with entire consecration
and self-sacrifice, as evidenced in her long ser-
vice in the church and in her imswerving
fidelity to her home. She is an optimist. The
greatness of her trust inspires and strengthens
her. She fills a large i)lace in the conmuunty
through her silent inHuence, and with all her
usefulness and power Ikm- life is crowned with
rare modesty."

Her tireless and constant thought is for the
welfare of those with whom she is associated,
even to the neglect of her own best physical
welfare. The virtue of altruism, much alluded
to in recent years, Mrs. Fisher has been prac-
tising all her life. She has often said that her
first thought, duty, and effort were due to her
home: her second, to her church and Sunday-
school; and, if she had any reserve strength,
it was at the service of any good cause that
needed it the most. In addition to more press-
ing duties she has found time to advocate and
labor for the enfranchisement of woman, giving
her opportiunty to rise to her highest level.




LUCY B. FISHER

235



Mrs. Fisher was among th(&gt; earliest to join
the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and
has remained an earnest and ('on.sistent mem-
ber. She early united her efforts with others in
aid of the Baldwinsville Hospital ('ottages for
the care and treatment of children afflicted with
epileptic and allied diseases.

Believing that, so long as the impelling mo-
tive of humanity is a selfish one, so long will
the kingdom of heaven be postponed, here or
elsewhere, Mrs. Fisher sympathizes with the
present trend toward sociological ideals. Her
character antl tlisposition are such that she
cannot tolerate or excuse the wrongs of society
resulting from the worship of mammon, with
its consequent development of selfishness, the
prolific mother of evil and crime. The only
effective remedy, in her estimation, is public
ownershiji of all public utilities, replacing com-
petition by co-operation. Then, as she reasons,
the world would be in a position to realize some-
thing of the true spirit of Jesus of Nazareth,
whose life bore testimony to the brotherhood
of man.

These words from Miss Frances E. Willard
are in line with her thought : " I believe the
things tliat Christian .socialism stands for. It
is Goil's way out of the wilderness and into
the promised land. It is the marrow and fat-
ness of Christ's gospel. It is Christianitv ap-
plied."



HARRIET EMILY BENEDICT, Re-
gent of the John Hancock Chapter
of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, is a native of Le Roy,
Genesee County, N.Y. She was born Novem-
ber 13, 1842, daughter of Dr. Mo.ses and Fanny
Alvord (White) Barrett.

Her father, who M-as born January 28, 1815,
was the son of Jetlediah and I*]unice (Gleason)
Barrett. His paternal grandfather, Lemuel
Barrett, was a soklier in the war of the Revolu-
tion. Moses Barrett studied medicine at the
Pittsfield Medical College. His wife, whose
maiden name was Fanny Alvord White, was
born in Heath, Ma.ss., February 19, 1813, daugh-
ter of David and Sophia (Kendrick) White.
She was a friend and ]Hii)il of .Mary Lyon prior



to the founding of Mount Holyoke Seminary
(now College). Mrs. Barrett' was thus well
qualified to be her daughter's first instructor —
"first and last," as held in that ilaughter's
loving, grateful remembrance, but not her
only teacher, it must be added.

Haniet Emily Barrett attended the excel-
lent schools of Le Roy in her early childhood.
Later, her parents changing their place of resi-
dence, she pursued her studies at various in-
stitutions of learning in the West. On Febru-
ary 11, 1868, she was married to Washington
Gano Benedict, a native of Rhode Island. He
was son of Thomas S. and Ruth A. (Smith)
Benedict, a lineal descenilant of Thomas' Bene-
dict, who settled in Norwalk, Conn., more than
two hundred years ago.

Mr. Benedict's paternal grandfather, the
Rev. David Benedict, a native of Norwalk,
Conn., was for many years the pastor of a
Baptist church in Pawtucket, R.I. He mar-
ried Margaret IL, daughter of the Rev. Stephen
Gano and grand-daughter of the Rev. John
Gano, of New York City, who served as a chap-
lain in the Revolutionary War. 'Stephen Gano
studied medicine in his youth, and for about
two years servetl as a surgeon in the Conti-
nental army. He afterward studied for the
-Baptist ministry, and was settled in Provi-
dence. The Rev. John Gano, Mr. Benedict's
great-great-grandfather, was a charter member
of the Society of the Cincinnati, ami the Rev.
Stephen Gano was also a member. Mr. Bene-
dict was well known in the business world. He
built the first electric railway in the State of
Mas.sachusetts, that from Winthrop Junction to
Revere Beach. For some years he was presi-
dent of the Boston and Revere Electric Railway
Company. He died January 24, 1S99.

Mrs. Benedict has three sons: Francis Gano,
born October 3, 1870; \'allette Lyman, born
August 28, 1872; anil Clarence Barrett, born
October 29, 1874. Francis Gano Benedict, a
graduate of Harvard (A.B. 1893, A.M. 1894),
continued his stutlies at Heidelberg, Germany,
and took his Ph.D. in one year, something
never before achieved by an American. He is
now a professor in Wesleyan University, Miil-
dletown, Conn. He married July 28, 1897,
Cornelia Golay. A daughter, Elizabeth Har-

riet, was born March 12, 1902. [For further
information concerning Professor Benedict,
chemist and educator, author of "Elemen-
tary Organic Analysis," 1900, and "Cheniicai
Lecture Experiments," 1901, see "Who's AVho
in America. ' ']

\'allette Lyman Benedict, electrical engineer,
graduate of the Massacliusetts Institute of
Technology, 1894, is with the General Electric
Company, Schenectady, N.Y. He married Flor-
ence Marian Ballard, June 21, 1900. A son,
Russell Gano, was born May 15, 1902.

Clarence Barrett Benedict, lawyer, in Boston,
married Millicent Emily Thompson, Deceml:)er
5, 1900.

Mrs. Benedict, as noted above, is the pres-
ent Regent of the John Hancock Chapter of
the Daughters of the American Revolution.
She was admitted to membership as a great-
grand-daughter of Benjamin White, who served
in the war as a Lieutenant and later as Cap-
tain, and assisted in the capture of Burgoyne.
She has been a member of the New England
Women's Club, is still a member of the Cas-
tilian Club, and is one of the Board of Visitors
to the New England Conservatory of Music.

She is particularly intcrestefl in the Con-
servatory student.s, in behalf of whom she has
exercised generous and cheering hospitality,
taking great pleasure in befriending joung
ladies and girls who were far away from their
homes. In religion she is an Episcopalian,
being a member of Trinity Church.



^NNE ELIZABETH MERRILL, who
/ \ ^has for many years occupied the posi-
X ^ tion of Supervisor of Music in the pub-
lic schools of Portland, Me., with much
credit, is a native of that State, being one of
the two surviving daughters of the late Cap-
tain Samuel and Sarah Perkins (Sturgis) Ran-
dall. The home of her parents for many years
was in Riverside, formerly a part of Vassal-
boro, Kennebec County. Her paternal grand-
father, Benjamin Randall, was one of the pio-
neer settlers of that town. His wife was Susan
Cross. He was a lineal descendant of William
Randall, who settled in Scituate, Mass., be-
fore 1640. A Benjamin Randall is on record



as a private in Captain Bartholomew York's
company, Colonel Edmund Phinney's regi-
ment, at Fort George, December, 1776, also
in the same company, July, 1777 (Massachu-
setts Archives).

Captain Samuel Randall, shipmaster, was
for a long period successfully engaged in voy-
aging, but eventually through fire and ship-
wreck he met with severe losses. Going to
California to start afresh, he became master
of a high-water steamboat on the Sacramento
River. Nearly four years later, and after he
had retrieved his fortune and his own boat was
not running, he lost his life by a boiler explo-
sion on a low-water steamer, on which at the
request of a friend he had embarked as captain
for a single trip. His property was in Cali-
fornia, where he had made large investments,
and his family was apparently well provided
for. Monthly dividends for a time were regu-
larly sent to Mrs. Randall, then in Portland.
At length notice was received of a change of
management, and after that no more remit-
tances were received. Hence the straitened
circumstances in which she passed her declining
years, years of mental and physical infirmity.

Mrs. Randall was the daughter of Jonathan
Sturgis and his wife, Melinda Hartwell Perkins.
Jonathan Sturgis was a lineal descendant in
the sixth generation of Edward' Sturgis, who
emigrated from England about the year 1634,
and in 1639 settled at Yarmouth, on Cape Cod.
Edward^ Sturgis, son of Edward,' married Tem-
perance Gorham, who was born in Marshfield,
Mass., in 1646. She was a daughter of Captain
John Gorham and his wife. Desire Howland.
who was the daughter of John Howland and
grand-daughter of John Tilly, both of whom
came over in the "Mayflower" in 1620.

Edward^ Sturgis, born in 1673, son of Ed-
ward^ and Temperance, married Mehitable Hallet
in 1703; and their son Edward* married Thank-
ful Hedge, and was father of Edward,'' who
married Mary Bassett. The last named coui:)le,
with f(nir sons — James, David, Jonathan, and
Heman — moved from Bainstable, Mass., to
Vassalboro, Me., in 1795. On the ground where
they settled were many Indian graves, and
often, even to this day, Indian implements
are turned up by the plough.

Jonathan" Sturgis was born in November,
1782. His wife Melinda, whose maitlen name
was Perkins, is dimly remembered by her
grand-daughter, Mrs. Merrill, as being intel-
lectual and refined, a gentlewoman of the olden
time. She was cousin to the Hon. Reuel Will-
iams, of Augusta, the kinship being through
the Ingrahams. His maternal grandparents,
Jeremiah and Abigail (Hartwell) Ingraham,
who were married in Stoughton, Mass., in 1755,
and removed to Augusta, Me., were hers also.
As their daughter Zilpha, who married Seth
Williams, was the mother of Reuel, it may be
taken for granted that their daughter Tilly,
who married a Mr. Perkins (see History of
Augusta, Me.), was the mother of Melinda.
Abigail Hartwell, it may be added, was daugh-
ter of Joseph' Hartwell, son of SamueP and
grandson of William' Hartwell, an early set-
tler of Concord, Mass. Elizabeth Hartwell,
sister of Abigail, was the wife of Roger Sher-
man, the statesman.

The subject of this sketch received her ear-
liest education mostly at private schools, and
then attended the Augusta High School, where
she was graduated. At an early age she showed
marked ability as a singer, probably inheriting
her love for music from both parents. At first
she sang as the birds sing, for pure joy and
love of singing. An uncle who played the
violin took great interest in her early train-
ing, and taught her to read music unaided
by an instrument.

At fifteen Miss Randall sang in a church
choir in Augusta, and at the same time she
began studying with representative teachers
in Boston. At nineteen she married Albert
Pembroke Merrill, who was connected with the
large whotesale lumber house of Moses anil
James L. Merrill, of Portland. They took up
their abode in Portland. The wetlded life of this
young couple was soon blighted, as in less than a
year after marriage Mr. Merrill was pronounced
a hopeless invalid, and, closely following this
calamity, business reverses came, the loss
of fortune necessitating removal fro n a lux-
urious home and the bearing of heavy burdens.
Mrs. Merrill then began singing in church
on a salary, first at old St. Luke's, now St.
Stephen's, then at Congress Square Church,



where she remained twelve years. The
death of Mr. Merrill after an illness of nearly
five years was followed some years later
by that of her only child, Martha Pitts Merrill,
at the age of twelve. Through these and other
home trials that came, testing her faith and
strength, Mrs. Merrill showed herself steadfast,
keeping up her nuisical work as well as caring
for the invalids in her family.

She was one of the charter members of the
Rossini Club, one of the best known ami most
exclusive musical clubs of Portland, and a mem-
ber of the Haydn Association. She had large
voice classes, and was soloist at many large con-
certs throughout New England. In 1884 the po-
sition of Supervisor and Teacher of Music in
the Portland public schools was proffered her.
Accepting it after some consideration, she has
hekl the position with growing favor ever since,
and has brought the school music to its pres-
ent high standard. This sort of teaching called
for additional self-training; and each summer
she has attendeil sunnner schools, thus keep-
ing in touch with up-to-date methods. She
has studied under such teachers as Professor
Hugh A. Clark, of the University of Pennsyl-
vania, Professor Zuchtmann, Professor Lyman
Wheeler, Madame Herminie Rudersdorff, Mr.
William H. Dennett, and Mr. Holt, for many
years a leading teacher in the Boston schools.

Mrs. Merrill's elder sister, Martha S. Randall,
married Eben Pillsbury, and died in Minne-
sota, leaving a daughter, now Mrs. Keach, of
Hartford, Conn. The other sister, who lives
with Mrs. Merrill and skilfully manages their
household affairs, is Miss Harriet Howard
Randall. Mrs. Merrill is much loved and re-
spected by her large circle of acquaintances.
She is a prominent worker in St. Luke's Cathe-
dral, of which she is a member.



DELILAH S. DAVIS, an earnest and
liberal sup[wrter of patriotic work,
has been a department officer of the
Woman's Relief Corps of Massachu-
setts for several years. Born November 28,
1833, in that part of the old town of Methuen
now includetl in Lawrence, Mass., she was one
of the twelve children, six boys and six girls,

of John and Delilah (Smith) Graves. Her father,
born September 27, 1800, in New Market,
N.H., died November 23, 1880, in Palmer, Mass.

Her paternal grandfather, .Joseph Graves,
was born in 1761 in Stratham, Rockingham
County, N.H. His wife was Mary Badger, of
Portsmouth, N.H. Her brother, Daniel Batlger,
was a ship-builder. He was buried on
Badger's Island, near Portsmouth, N.H., and
on his tombstone was recorded the number of
ships he built. The mother of Mrs. Davis
was born in Wolfborough, N.H., April 12, 1798.
She died in Palmer, Mass., June 4, 1873. She
was one of the four children and the youngest
of the three daughters of James and Abigail
(Pinkham) Smith. Her maternal grandfather,
Abijah Pinkham, was a soldier of the Revolu-
tion, the records showing that he was a private
in Captain Smith Emerson's company on
Seavey's Island in November, 1775. Abigail
Pinkham after the death of James Smith,
her first hasband, married Reuben Libby, by
whom she had a son and a daughter.

John Graves and Delilah Smith were married in
1821 in Boston, where Mr. Graves was engaged
in the livery busine.ss. He subsecjuently bought
a farm in Methuen, built a soap factory, and
conducted an extensive business. After the
founding, in 1847, of Lawrence, the "new
city," as it was called, he removed to Billerica.
Here his daughter Delilah attended a private
school. She had previously been a pupil in
the Prospect Street School, Lawrence, formerly
Methuen: and when, in 1850, the family returned
to Lawrence, she was admitted to the Law^-ence
High School. It being decided in the home
council that she could not take the full three
years' course of study, .she preferred to give up
school at once, which she was allowed to do.
On June 22, 1851, she was married to Edwin
Lawrence Davis. He was born in Billerica,
February 17, 1831, son of Timothy Jr. and Su.san
S. (Lawrence) Davis. Timothy Davis Jr. died
in Billerica in 1841. His wife, Susan S., was the
daughter of the Rev. Nathaniel Lawrence, who
preached in Tyngsboro, Mass., forty years, and
delivered a sermon on the day of his death.
He died suddenly, of apoplexy. His son,
Samuel S. Lawrence, was a prominent merchant
of Boston. Timothy Davis Jr. was a member of



the Bunker Hill Monument Association, which
was formetl in 1823. Mrs. Davis has in her
po.ssession his certificate of membenship, signed
by the president of the association, J. Brooks;
the vice-presidents, T. H. Perkins and Joseph
Story: the secretary, Franklin Dexter: the
treasurer, Nathaniel P. Russell; and fourteen
directors.

Edwin Lawrence Davis, enlisting in the
navy in 1864, was in the United States service
in the latter ])art of the Civil War as captain's
clerk on the steamer "Miami." Mrs. Davis
hatl two brothers in the L^nion army, one of
whom died in a hospital at Alexandria.

Mr. and Mrs. Davis removed in September,
1853, to Palmer, Mass., where Mr. Davis pur-
cha-sed a dry-goods store, and was a successful
merchant. They had two children: George
Lawrence, l)orn March 26, 1854, who died
Nov. 29, 1883: and Annie Elizabeth, who is
still living. Mrs. Davis became interested in
church and charitable work in Palmer, devoting
her special efforts to the cause represented
by L. L. Merrick Post, G. A. R., and its aux-
iliary Relief Corps, which was formed in 1886.
She was elected first President of the Relief
Corps, and was installed into this office five
years in succession.

At the annual State convention held in
Boston in 1891 she was elected Senior A'ice-
President. The office of President of the
Department of Ma.ssachusetts, Woman's Re-
lief Corps, was tendered her the following year,
but she was unable to accept the honor, as
her husband was in failing health.

During the destructive fire in Palmer in
1895 Mr. Davis's store was burned. They
went to Gardiner, Me., in the spring of 1896,
and in December of th(&gt; same year returned
to Massachusetts, settling in Springfield. Mr.
Davis died in that city, January 6, 1897. In
October following Mrs. Davis moved to Law-
rence, where she now resides with her daughter.

In 1900 Mrs. Davis was elected Department
Chaplain of the Massachusetts Woman's Relief
Corps, and at the aimual convention of 1901
she was re-elected. Referring to this office,
she said: "Fully appreciating the honor con-
ferred, I assumed the sacred duties of Chaplain,
and have filled the position to the best of my



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



239



ability. The work lia.s been an inspiration to
me and given me a better knowledge of what
has been done through the State on Memorial
Day."

In her last report as Dei)artmcnt Chaplain
she stated that members assisted in tlecorating
the graves of thirty-four thousand four hun-
dred and fifty-one soldiers in Massacliusetts,
that flowers were furnished one hundred and
twenty-two posts on Memorial Day, and that
memorials and Horal designs for the unknown
deatl who sleep in nameless graves were pre-
pared by one hundred and thirty-nine corps.
Memorial Day work in the South was aided
by one humlred and fourteen corps in Massa-
chusetts.

The number of children who assisted in me-
morial exercises under the direction of corps
was reportetl as twenty-eight thousand five
hundred and fifty-five. An elaborate account
of this work throughout the State was pre-
pared by Mrs. Davis, her report containing
twenty-one printetl pages.

Elected a member of the Department Exec-
utive Board in 1902, Mrs. Davis has continued
her interest with the same loyal enthusiasm
as in other years. She has served as Inspector
and on numerous committees. As a delegate
to several national conventions she has trav-
elled in many States, and has been recognized
by national appointments in the order. Mrs.
Davis is a liberal contributor to the various
objects of the W. R. C, and takes special inter-'
est in its charitable and philanthropic work.

She has been a guest of corjts in North and
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and in other
Southern States. The Andersonville Prison
property under the management of the Na-
tional W. R. C. has received her lilieral support,
and she has visited these historic grounds in
Georgia.

Mrs. Davis is a woman of firm convictions,
and is devoted to the principles of loyalty and
justice. Her steadfast friendship and kindly
deeds are appreciated by her associates.

She attends the Methodist Episcopal Church
in Lawrence. She is a member of the Charity
Club of that city, also of the Woman's Christian
Temperance I'nion and of the auxiliary to the
Young Men's Christian Association of Lawrence.



Her husband was a nieniber of the Masonic
lodge in Palmer, and she is therefore interested
in the Order of the Eastern Star. Revere
Chapter, No. 4, of that city, elected her its
first secretary.

For several years Mrs. Davis has been an
active member of the Ladies' Aid Association
of the SoKliers' Home in Massachusetts. As
a visitor, director, and in other capacities she
has given time, money, and effort for the welfare
of the home. The officials and inmates recog-
nize her faithful work in its behalf.

Mrs. Davis, through her great-grandfather
Pinkham, above mentioned, has membership
in Bunker Hill Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution.

Mrs. Davis has one sister living, namely:
Sarah Abbie Graves, whose home is in Indiana;
another sister, Octavia McFarland, who resided
in San Francisco, died ,Iune .5, 1S93. Her only
brother, Sewell F. Graves, resides hi Alameda,
Cal. He is a sea cajitain, was in the United
States navy during the Civil War, and is now
a pilot in San Francisco Harbor.

hurst, Dorsetshire, and his wife, Joanna Arnold,
daughter of Thomas Arnold, son of Richard
Arnold, whose ancestral line, it is said, has been
traced back to Charlemagne.

Mrs. Baklwin's maternal ancestry begins in
New England with William Torrey, who set-
tled in Weymouth, Mass., in 1640. Born in
Combe St. Nicholas, Somersetshire, England,
in 1608, son of Philip Torrey, second, and his
wife Alice, he was a lineal descendant in the
fifth generation of William Torrey, who died
at Combe St. Nicholas in 1557, leaving a wife,
Thomasine, and two sons. The line in Eng-
land continued through the first William's son
Philip, Philip's son William, second, to the

of the third William, who, being the first of
his line in America, is designated as William.'
The other three sons of Philip Torrey, .second —
James,' Philip,' and Joseph — also came to New
England in 1640.

William' Torrey, of Weymouth, .served many

A NNA BARROWS, teacher of cookery

/ \ and lecturer on home science, was born
XA in Fryeburg, Me., May 24, 1861, the
daughter of George Bradley antl Geor-
giana (Souther) Barrows. Her father, George
Bradley Barrows, who was at one time president
of the Maine Senate, was the son of John S.
Barrows and his wife, Anna Ayer Bradley, and
grandson of William Barrows, the founder of
Hebron Academy, Maine. The first of the name
in this country was John Barrowe, of Yarmouth,
England, who came to New England in 1637,
and about thirty years later settled in Plym-
outh, Mass., where some of his early descend-
ants occupied the Bonum house, which is still
standing.

Miss Barrows' ancestry is chiefly English.
Her paternal grandmother was a daughter of
John and Hannah (Ayer) Bradley and grand-
daughter of Samuel Bradley, who was killed by
the Indians near Concord, N.H., in 1746; and
on the maternal side she was grand-daughter
of Samuel Ayer, of Haverhill, Mass., and his
wife, Ann Hazen. (See Bouton's History of
Concord, N.H., for these and other particulars.)

Her maternal grandparents (as mentioned in
" Memoranda relating to the Descentlants of
Joseph Souther, of Boston") were Samuel and
Mary (Webster) Souther, the grandfather a son
of John Souther, whose wife Mary was a daugh-
ter of Colonel Thomas Stickney, of Concord,
N.H., who commantled a regiment at the battle
of Bennington.

On her mother's side Miss Barrows traces
her descent from a sister of General John Stark
and from Hugh Stirling, a native of Glasgow,
who came to America about 1745, having served
previously as Lieutenant in the British army.
Several of Miss Barrows's ancestors on both



sides served in the colonial and Revolutionary
wars.

After graduating from Fryeburg Academy in
1882, Miss Barrows taught in the public schools
of that town and of Conway, N.H. From her
girlhood she w'as a practical housekeeper, and
before leaving Fryeburg she served in many
capacities, from that of organist in the Con-
gregational church, of which she is a member,
to that of village postmistress. In 1886 she
took the normal course at the Boston Cooking
School under Miss Ida Maynard. The follow-
ing autumn, after supervising the opening of
a new cottage at Wellesley College, in which
a full system of domestic work was to be tried,
she became the teacher of cooking at the North
Bennet Street Industrial School, Boston, where
she remained five years. This was before man-
ual training was included in the regular studies
of the public schools. A class from a different
school came at each session.
' The N^eiv England Journal of Education, com-
menting on her work, said, " Miss Anna Barrows
has made such a success of cooking as an edu-
cational force, as well as an industrial activity,
that her work deserves study, and commands
the respect of the most devout student of peda-
gogy, as well as of specialties." Mr. Howells,
the novelist, after watching a boys' class in
cooking at that school, said that he had " heard
more natural philosophy demonstrated in half
an hour than some people acquired in the whole
course of their lives."

In 1891 Miss Barrows resigned, to accept
the position of instructor in the School of Do-
mestic Science connected with the Boston
Young Women's Christian Association, and in
addition to this work gave lectures and class
instruction in cookery at Lasell Seminary, Au-
burndale, Mass. The growing public interest
in domestic science and consequent demand
for lectures occupied so much time that the
routine school work was given up for the larger
field.

Miss Barrows has lectured for women's clubs
and given over a thousand demonstrations in
cookery in many States. She has lectured in
New York for several seasons in the Farmers'
Institute courses, and has given addresses
before many State agricultural organizations



242

in that ami other States, as the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society, the Maine Pomological
Society, the Vermont Dairymen's Association,
and the Western New York Horticultural Soci-
ety. At the present time the only regular
school work that Miss Barrows continues is an
annual course of fifteen weekly lessons at
Robinson Seminary, Exeter, N.H.

In 1894 she became one of the editors and
proprietors of the (then New England) Ameri-
can Kitchen Magazine, a monthlj' devoted to
home science, in which much of her writing was
published until March, 1904, when she severed
her connection with the Home Science Pub-
lishing Company.

For other periodicals she has written many
articles on her specialty and allied topics. She
has published a small book on Eggs, and with
Mrs. Mary J. Lincoln, the "?Iome Science Cook
Book," and has other books in preparation.

The constant aim of all her teaching and
writing is the simplification of the processes of
housekeeping. She devotes herself not to a
multiplication of recipes and the preparation
of fancy dishes, but the teaching of funda-
mental principles, from which each housekeeper
may adapt herself to her individual limitations
and needs. The agricultural and horticultural
bearings of the subject are particularly inter-
esting to her.

For several years a summer school of cookery
at the Fryeburg Chautauqua Assembly was in
her charge. From this she was called to be
instructor in cookery at the School of Domestic
Science of the original Chautauqua in New
York State. She has been superintendent of
the department of hygienic cooking in the Mas-
sachusetts W. C. T. U., president of the Cooking
School Teachers' League, director of the Na-
tional Hou.sehold Economic Association, and
secretary of the Association of the Alumni and
Friends of Fryeburg Academy, a Massachusetts
corporation.

In 1900 Mi.ss Barrows was chosen a member
of the Boston School Committee, being nomi-
nated on a reform ticket and endorsed by the
Independent Women Voters and the Republi-
cans. Although she made no personal canvass,
she was elected by the largest number of votes
cast for any city officer at that election. Her



work on the connnittee was done quietly,
with careful regard for the interests of the
schools.



REV. SARAH A. DIXON, S.T.B., pas-
tor of the Congregational church in
.^ Tyngsborough, Ma.'^s., was boin in
the town of Barnstable, on Cape Cod,
where her parents, William and Joice (Cas-
coyne) Dixon, natives f)f Warwickshire, Eng-
land (the father a soldier in the Fortieth Mas-
sachusetts Regiment in 1862), are now living.
She is the youngest of a family of eight chil-
dren, four sons and four daughters. When
asked not long ago concerning her "call to
preach," she replied, "I had always had a
great desire to hel}) people, and when about
twenty years of age this desire developed into
a definite decision to be a minister."

Miss Dixon's early life was her best prepara-
tion. Her girlhood was sjjcnt mostly in school
and out of doors, her home being near the
shore; and her young soul was filled with
the incense from the fields, the marshes, and
the sea.

Two early incidents proved to be determin-
ing factors in her life. One was the "redemp-
tion" which came to her through the influence
of her grannnar school teacher. His interest
and keen insight into her nature inspired her
with an ambition to excel, and changed her
from a "trouble" in the school into a student.
From this time until she was sixteen lessons
were mastered and liigh rank held without any
definite hope of oiipoituiiities for a higher edu-
cation.

The other determining incident came when
Miss Dixon was sixteen years old. Two young
women of Barnstable, hearing of her progress
in her studies, became interested in her wel-
fare. They offered to help send her to Bridge-
water Normal School. Her parents were very
glad to accept the kindness, as they were not
possessed of an abundance of this world's
goods, and tliey had a large family. By giv-
ing enterlaiiimcnts and soliciting among their
friends these two ladies w(&gt;re enabletl to raise
the money to ])ay her expenses for the first
}'ear. Accordingly she entered Bridgewater



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



243



Normal School in 1883, and was graduated in
1885.

Miss Dixon was now eighteen years old,
holding a teacher's diploma and waiting for
a position. She was asked to teach the pri-
mary department in lirewster, Mass., which
she did .successfully for a year. Then followetl
two years' work in the intermediate grade at
Cotuit. At the enil of this period her former
teacher secured for her a position in one of the
Brockton schools, and in that city she spent
two j'ears. It was while in l^rockton that Miss
Dixon decided to study for the ministry. She
determined to prepai'e herself for the career
of an efficient worker. With this end in view
she entered in the fall of ISOO the College of
Liberal Arts of Boston University. She laugh-
ingly told her friends that she intended to take
seven years of college and theological work,
that she had poor preparation, poor health,
one hundred and fifty dollars, and a conviction
that it was the right thing to do. This convic-
tion made it possible for her to accomplish the
task. The second year was the hardest: her
money was expended, and she was obliged to
do some work outsitle of her college cour.se.
During all of this year .she taught an evening
school three nights each week, and every
Wetlnesday taught as a substitute in the Ham-
mond Street Granmiar School. This left but
three evenings and four days a week for all
of her college work. At the end of the year
Miss Dixon's health failed, and .she was obliged
to lie in one of the Boston hospitals foi- sixteen
weeks. The next year, through the kindness
of friends and her physician, she was enabled
to pursue her studies without doing extra
work, and was graduated, taking the degree
of Bachelor of Phild.soph}-. The following
September she entered the Theological School
of Boston University, and was the only woman
in the school eligible to a divinity degree.
During her course here an opportimity came
to her to supply the pulpit of the Methodist
Church at Centreville, Ma,ss. This village on
Cape Cod is five miles from Barnstable, her
native place, and seventy-five miles from Bos-
ton, where she was at school. I''or two years
she travelled this distance every wt'ck, iireach-
ing on Sundays and taking full charge of the



work. She was not allowed to be called the
pastor, as the Methodisti^ do not grant licenses
to women to preach; but the people wanted
her, and so she was allowed to do the work,
the presiding elder t)f the district being nomi-
nally the pastor.

Miss Dixon was graduated from the Theo-
logical School early in June, 1S97, taking the
degree of Bachelor of Sacred Tlieology and
ranking among the first in her class. Dur-
ing the last few months of her coiu'se she
had supplied the pulpit of the Congregational
Church at Tyngsborough, Mass. She now re-
ceived a unanimous call from this church to
become its .settled pastor.

(^n the 10th of June, after being sub-
jected to a long and trying examination by a
council of all the churches in the .A.n(lover
Conference, which ni(&gt;t at TytLsborough, she
was ordained a minister of the gospel. The
ordaining prayer was offered by the Rev.
I. AA'. Dodge, of Newburyport: the right
hand of fellowshi]i liy the Rev. Amelia
Frost, then minister of the Congregational
Church at Littleton; and the charge to the
churches by the Rev. \\. A. Bartlett, now of
('hicago.

Miss Dixon has sei'ved as pastor of this
church at Tyngsborough for seven years with
marked success. Its meml)ership since she
came here has increa.sed nearly one-third. In
all departments the church work has been
([uickened, and the society has enjoyed a greater
degree of i)rosperity, both s|iiritual and material,
than ever before in its history. A new pipe
organ has been bought, and extensive repairs
and impi-ovements have been made on the
church building and jiarsonage.

Well-e(|uipjied for lier profession, Miss Dixon
shrinks from none of its duties. She has con-
ducted thirty or moi'e fiuieral .services in her
parish, and has married sixteen couples. She
lias delivered two Memorial Day orations in
Provincetown, one in Barnstable, anil one in
Tyngsborough, has read papers, notably one
on Browning, before literary societies, and
made addresses at various jniblic gatherings.

In June, 1902, she started on a four months'
tn'i) to Eurojie, returning in Septendier. On
the Continent she visited Antwerp, Rouen,



244



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Paris, and in England, London, Lincoln, York,
Chester, and other places. She preached in
Birniina;hani, St rat ford-on- A von, and in Brailes
and ^^'ellesbourne in Warwickshire.

She keeps house in (he cose}- parsonage in
Tyngslx) rough, and her home is a centre for
uplifting and stimulating influences. Her
frankness and sincerity have won for her the
confidence as well as the warm affection of her
parishioners, her wliole-souled devotion to her
chosen work and the earnestness and aptness
of her pulpit utterances impressing even the
casual hearer and chance acquaintance. Her
hundreds of friends and admirers feel that she
reflects honor upon the sacred profession.
Years of careful study and high thinking have
made her the cultured, refined woman whom
to meet is a pleasure long to be rememljered
and to number in friendship is a privilege.



KATE SANBORN.— Breezy Meadows,
cool, shady, a brook singing along a
few steps from the piazza; cattle,
sleek and contented, grazing on the
rolling slopes of upland pasture; fields of grow-
ing timothy and clover, grain and corn, on every
hand. A garden, blossoming full with flowers
of our grandmothers' day, antl new varieties
also, leads into but half hides another, where
grow old-fashioned and new-fangled fruits,
berries, and vegetables, for the refreshment
of mistress and guests.

The hand of the landscape artist has never
touched the place. Rose-bushes and a few
shrubs grow at will about the house, which is
an old-fashioned one, standing in their niitist
well back from the highway. Great trees are
near, but not many shadow the building, which
gives out such an air of sunshine, of inbred
hospitality, that one smiles before pounding
a summons on the brass knocker, and keeps
on smiling, for the welcome from the mistress
is sincere.

This is the home of Kate Sanborn; and she
loves it, and delights to entertain her friends
here, both the famed and the fameless.

One walks through the large sunny rooms,
with books everywhere, quaint things in corners
and odd places. There is a distaff full of flax



in a niche half-way up the stairway, and at
its head a wool wheel, banded ready for use.
Coming to the dining-room, one finds a great
fireplace, never changed since the olden day
when the house was built, immense fire-dogs,
big bellows, tongs, and shovel, made in a primi-
tive blacksmith's shop. Many a distinguished
guest has chatteil and laughed by its crackling
fire, many a merry group surrounded it. It
is not a show place, but a home; and Miss San-
born's hospitality is much larger than her acres.
Sometimes it is a picnic party out from Boston,
and always a guest in the house, often half
a dozen. She is a good housekeeper and an
excellent farmer.

She lives outdoors, makes her garden, and
walks among the growing crops. Dogs and
horses know the clear, wholesome ring of her
voice, and come to be petted. Even the cows
are a little more attentive when she calls. Only
a womanly woman, a lady born and reared,
could live her life of good cheer, literary en-
vironment, and farming.

Miss Sanborn was eminently well born. Her
father was Edwin D. Sanborn, who for prac-
tically all his life held a professorship in Dart-
mouth College. From LS37 to 1859 he occu-
pieil with distinguished ability the chair of
Latin language antl literature. In the last-
named year he accepted the Latin professor-
ship and presidency of Washington University,
at St. Louis, returning four years later to the
chair of oratory and literature at Dartmouth,
which he held until he retired from active work.
Plis was a very long, able, and distinguished
career. In 1837 he married Mary A., daughter
of Ezekiel Webster, of Boscawen, N.H., a
niece of Daniel Webster.

Of this grandfather, Daniel says: "Ezekiel
was witty, quick at repartee, his conversation
full of illustrative anecdote." He was a man of
wonderful presence. "In manly beauty," said
Daniel, " he is inferior to no person that I ever
saw." He was a model lawyer and a model
man, simple and temperate.

His "Credo," which is preserved, is one of
the most clear, simple, and perfect papers of
its kind to be found in the annals of Christi-
anity. All his leisure from business and his
family was devoted to books. Lawyers who



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



245



were in court with him called him the peer
of his illustrious brother, both in law and in
oratory. His death in the very prime of man-
hood made an intensely dramatic scene in the
old Merrimack County court-house at Concord.
Concluding a remarkable plea, he stood grace-
fully for a moment while the court and his
brothers of the bar were silent under the spell
of his speech. Then he fell slowly backwanl
to the floor, and was gone. ''What shadows
we are, what shadows we pursue!" exclaimed
George Sullivan, the illustrious Attorney-gen-
eral of New Hampshire. He died April 10,
1829.

Mrs. Webster lived to great age, a dainty,
lovely woman, dying January 31, 1896.

Miss Sanborn was educated at home by her
father almost entirely, though tutors in math-
ematics were employed for her. Her drill in
Latin commenced at eight years with studying
a Latin booklet, and continued till she left
home to support herself. It comprised more
than a college course. This year after year of
translating, scanning, wortl selection and
phrasing, was a wonderful training in language.
She was obliged to connuit to memory some
portion of prose or poetry daily, and also to
describe something in writing. Then followetl
apt quotations at the tea-table, later a good
anecdote. These teachings and tasks of mind
and memory were not dull drill, but part of
every-day, social family life.

W'hile such instruction set the course of her
career, it accomplished a thousand times more,
giving a splendid memory, ready for use.
Daily writing under skilled criticism, studying
the light and shade of word and expression,
the use of synonyms, pointed the " inevitable
nib " to her pen and also to her speech, so adding
another powet to naturally great mental en-
dowment. It was the love of her father and
her love for him which was ever the essential
feature of this instruction: there was in it no
drudgery for teacher or pupil.

At eleven she earned three dollars for a little
story her father sent to a child's paper, and thus
began a brilliant career successful beyond
most and still continuing.

The brightness of Miss Sanborn's books is
like sunlight glinting clear brooks and lighting



their depths. There is nothing tempestuous
or gusty about her composition, yet it is full of
anecdote, spirit, wit — keen thrusts in plenty,
but without spite, worded to a nicety, but
never shorn of strength. She inherited a love
for teaching, and began that employment in
the ell of her father's house, then went with
him to St. Louis, where she taught in Mary
Institute, connected with Washington Univer-
sity, at a salary of five hundred dollars per year,
of which she was very proud. After, she taught
elocution in Packer Institute, Brooklyn, so well
that Henry Ward Beecher said, "There used
to be a few prize pumpkins here, but now each
pupil is doing good work." At the .same time
she gave twenty lectures in New York City
each season upon such subjects as "Bachelor
Authors," " Punch as a Reformer," "Literary
Gossips," "Spinster Authors of England,"
and so forth.

In its early days Smith College called her
to teach English literature, and here she created
the "Round Table Series of Literature," once
published and used by many teachers. No
mortal can go over this collection of complete
and exact tables without knowing English
letters correctly nor look at one diagram five
minutes unprofitably. It shows marvellous
power of concentration and "monumental
drudgery." During her three years at Smith
Miss Sanborn lectured in Springfield, at Mrs.
Terhune's, and in many towns near the college.
Leaving Smith, she went on a lecturing tour
through the A^'est, and met success everywhere.
The exact knowledge, newness of thought and
subjects, elegant phrasing, and keen wit of this
gifted, warm-hearted New England woman
touched the Westerners. Great and enthusi-
astic audiences greeted her. Prairie folk were
proud of this deputy from Eastern home people,
and they made her stay among them a notable
event.

Returning, Miss Sanborn began teaching in
New York City, and also lecturing, first in Mrs.
Stokes's parlor, till, outgrowing it, she moved
to rooms of the Young Women's Christian Asso-
ciation, and finally to those in Dr. Howard
Crosby's church, speaking to audiences that
crowded them. This work was reported weekly
in the Tribune, World, Sun, ami Times.



246



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



For several years she reviewed books for the
Club Room Department in The Galaxy. Dr.
J. G. Holland gave her the Bric-a-brac Depart-
ment in Scribner's, and at this time she met
every week a class of married women at Mrs.
Holland's, condensing and discussing new books.
Meanwhile she was an individual and potent
factor in New York social and literary life.
At Mi-s. John Sherwood's — or in any place where
wit and wisdom gathered — she was at home,
unpretending, picturesque, humorous.

She has written over forty lectures, and read
them in many places in New York and the
West and all over New England. Calendars
are her recreation: they run right off her pen,
or are collected from other penmen. "&lt;)ur
Calendar" gives to each date a few lines from
an American author. Then we have "Cupid's,"
"ChiKIren's," "Sunshine," "Rainbow," "Star-
light," "Indian Summer" calendars; and,
just so long as Kate Sanborn e.xists in the flesh,
they will keep coming. Certainly that is our
hope.

Club work is outside her kingdom, but she
was the first president of New Hampshire's
Daughters, an as.sociation of women born in
New Hampshire, but living in Massachusetts
and New Hampshire. Hers was a notable
administration, and brought to the organiza-
tion a prestige which remains. Rules might
fail, but the brilliant president never. She
governed a merry company, many of them
famous, but she was chief. They loved her,
and that affection and pride still exist.

She is with her sister, Mrs. Paul Babcock,
at Montclair, N.J., or in New York, some part
of each winter; but her home is at Breezy
Meadows, Metcalf, Mass., where several years
since she "adopted" an abandoned farm,
which later .she deserted for a farm only a short
distance beyond it, on the opposite side of the
road, where she .settlerl down to agriculture,
hospitality, and authorship. In each of these
industries she excels, iiKJst of all in pen work.

Life is beautiful to Kate Sanborn, the homes
of friends delightful; but Breezy Meadows,
with its cattle, horses, and dogs, its bu.sy out-
door life, its growing crops and old-fashioned
flowers and hen-coops, its century-old fireplace
anil friends beside it, is ever the land of her



heart's desire. Her thoughts are transfixed
on the point of a sharp and fearless pen.

Miss Said)orn has published " Home Pict-
ures of English Poets" (commendations called
out by this one volume would make a book.
College men and students of literature point
to it as a fascinating study of facts, holding
a permanent ])lace of its own) ; " Wit of Women"
("Its play [of wit] is like that of summer light-
ning on the clouds, so quick, varied, and irra-
diant," writes Frances Willard); "Adopting
an Abandoned Farm"; "Abandoning an
Adopted Farm"; "A Truthful Woman in
Southern California"; "'My Literary Zoo";
"Favorite Lectures"; "Vanity and Insanity
Shadows of Genius." Not a dull volume or
lectui'e from this rarely gifted writer, and every
book does one good. If sentences are pictu-
res(|ue, witty, they are also lessons in excellent
English. How well this woman Avas equipped
for her work, how healthy and sunny, strong
and laughable, instructive and amusing, is
the product of her mind! And she is still busy,
preparing two new books, writing regular book
chats for one paper and reviews for the Natiojial
Magazine.



FLORENCE COLLINS PORTER, of the
editorial staff of the Los Angeles Herald,
was born in Caribou, Aroostook County,
Me., August 14, 185;-?, daughter of Sanuiel
Wilson and Dorcas S. ^Hardison) Collins.
Mrs. Pfirter's father, Sanuiel W. Collins, one
of the early jiioneers of Aroostook County,
served several terms in the Maine Legislature,
at first as Repre.sentative and later as State
Senator, and also held iin|)ortant town offices.
He was a manufacturer of lunil)er and a man
noted for generous and kindly deeds and dem-
ocratic principles. He died in 1898 at the ad-
vanced age of eighty-seven.

The Hardisons also were a family of early
pioneers, ilescendants of Ivory Hardison, who
made an impre.ss on the life and character
of the new town in the Aroostook forest. Mrs.
Dorcas S. Collins inherited many of the sterling
qualities of her mother, Mrs. Dorcas Abbott
Hardison, a very capable woman, of great
strengtli of character, for whom she was named.

Mrs. Collins h;i.s livcnl to sec ker live children
occupy positions of influence and honor. She
has recently gone to make her home with her
daughter Florence, Mrs. Porter, in South
Pasadena. At seventy-six years of age she
is in possession of active mental faculties, with
the prosjject of continued long life in the land
of sunshine.

Mi's. Porter was graduated from the public
schools of Caribou, and has always taken an
interest in educational matters. Elected as
a member of the School Committee of Cariboii
in 1882, she served in that capacity one year,
being one of the first women in the State of
Maine to hold such a position. After the
death of her husband, the Re^■. Charles AVilliam
Porter, in 1894, she served for four years as
Supeiintendent of the schools of Caribou, and
for a year was editor and proprietor of the
Aroostook Kepuhlican. The paper was a finan-
cial success, and proved to be the entrance
into a larger fiekl of journalism. Mrs. Porter's
maternal uncle, W allace L. Hardison, having
purchased the Los Angeles Herald, offered her
a lucrative and important position on the edi-
torial staff of that jjaper. Accordingly, in
Octol)er, 1900, !\Irs. Porter transferred her
interests from Maine to the Pacific coast.

Mrs. Porter has always been active in mat-
ters that pertain to woman's work and ad-
vancement. A\'hen but a girl in her teens,
she drove ten miles to hear the first woman
speaker that ever came into that ]iart of the
country in which she lived. Temperance work
early attracted her attention, and for four years
she was the national .secretary of the Non-
partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
whose headquarters were at Cleveland, Ohio.

From 1896 to 1898 Mrs. Porter was vice-
president of the Maine Federation of Women's
Clubs and from 1898 to 1900 the president.
When she went to Los Angeles, the Federation
showed its appreciation of her services by cre-
ating the office of honorary president, and
giving her that title. In Los Angeles she is
a member of the Friday Morning Cluli and
of the Ebell, and an honorary member of the
Ruskin Art Club. At tlip time of the biennial
meeting of 1902 she edited an illustrated souve-
nir edition of the Los Angeles Herald that at-



tracted wide attention, and drew forth many
compliments because of the accuracy of the
biographical sketches of club women and the
artistic (juality of the work. She conducts
a weekly column. She is in demand by clubs
and child-study circles for short addresses
on topics relating to women's work.

Florence Collins was married to the Rev.
Charles William Porter, November 3, 1873.
Mr. Porter was born in Houlton, Me. Or-
dained as a Congregational clergyman, he

father, namely: Helen Louise, born in Caribou,
July 28, 1876; Florence S., born in Caribou,
September 1, 1885; and Charles Winthrop
Porter, born in Winthrop, Me., January 14,
1891. Helen Louise was married in October,
1900, to Mr. John Gregg Utterback, of Roches-
ter, N.Y. The two younger children are liv-
ing with their mother in their new home, the
"Inglenook," recently built at South Pa.sadena.



ELECTA NOBLES LINCOLN WALTON,
wife of George A. Walton and co-
author with her husband of Walton's
Arithmetics, was born in Watertown,
N.Y., May 12, 1824, the youngest child of
Martin and Susan W. (Freeman) Lincoln. On
the paternal side she is a descendant of Samuel'
Lincoln, who settled at Hingham, Mass., in
1637, and of his son Mordecai," who was born
in Hingham in 1657. These two ancestors of
Mrs. Walton were also ancestors of the martyreil
President, Abraham Lincoln, who was of the
same generation that she i.s — the seventh.
Mrs. \\'alton's great-great-grandfather, Jacob^
Lincoln, born in 1711, son of Mordecai' by his
second wife, was half-brother to President
Lincoln's great -great -grandfather, Mordecai'
Lincoln, born in 1686, who removed from
Hingham, Mass., to New Jersey anil thence to
Pennsylvania. And Mrs. Walton's great-great-
grandfather on her grandmotlier Chloe's side,
namely, Lsaac^ Lincoln, born in 1691, was own
brother to President Lincoln's great-great-
grandfather, Mordecai,' both being sons of
.Mordecai" by his first wife, Sarah Jones.

Obadiali^ Lincoln, son of Jacob^ and Mary
(Holl)rook) Lincoln, was the father of Jacob,^
born in 1762, who married Chloe^ Lincoln,
daughter of Deacon Isaac^ and Sarah (Hobart)
Lincoln. .Licob^ and his wife Chloe'* were the
parents of Martin Lincoln, above named, father
of Mrs. Walton.

Through her grandmother, Chloe" Lincoln,
Mrs. Walton is descended from the Rev. Peter
Hobart, who settled at Hingham, Mass., in
September, 1635, and from his father, Edmund'
Hobart. Chloe Lincoln's mother, Mrs. Sarah
Hobart Lincoln, born in 1727, was a daughter of
the Rev. Nehemiah' Hobart fHarv. Coll., 1714),
minister of the Second Parish of Hingham, now
Cohasset. Her father's father, Davi(P Hobart,
of Hingham, was son of the Rev. Peter" Hobart
and one of a family of fifteen children. The
Rev. Peter Hobart, a graduate of Emmanuel
College, Cambridge, England (A.M. 1629),
died in 1679, in the fifty-third year of his min-
istry, nine years in Hingham, England, and
nearly forty-four in Hingham, Mass.

Mrs. Walton's father, Martin Lincoln, was
born in Cohasset in 1795. A teacher by pro-
fession, he tavight in the public schools of Lan-
caster, Mass., also in the Lancaster Academy,
and afterward for some years kept a private
school in Boston.

Mrs. AValton's mother, whose maiden name
was Susan \Miite Freeman, was the daughter
of Adam and Margaret (White) Freeman.
Adam Freeman, grandfather of Mrs. Walton,
emigrated with a party from Frankfort-on-the-
Main about 1780, and settled in the locality
then known as the "German Flats," afterward
named Frankfort, N.Y. His wife, Margaret
^\'hile Freeman, Mrs. Walton's maternal grand-
mother, was from Windsor, Vt. Archibald
\\'hite, Jr., and William ^^'hite, who ^are on
record as tax-paying inhabitants of the town
in 1786, w(&gt;re her brothers.

When Electa Not^les Lincoln was two years
old, her parents removed to Lancaster, Mass.,
the family afterward living in Roxbury and
Boston. Her first teacher and the chief in-
structor of her early years was her father. Li
the autumn of 1841 she entered the State Nor-
mal School in Lexington, Mass., of which the
Rev. Cyrus Peirce ("Father Peirce," of revered



memory) was t\w principal. About a year anil
a half later, or in 1843, having completed the
normal course of study and received her diploma,
she became an assistant in the Franklin Gram-
mar School, Boston. After teaching there
for a few weeks, she was ajjpointeil assistant in
the Normal School, her Alma Mater, where
sh(&gt; began to teach on May 7, 1843, when she
lacketl five days of being nineteen years old.
She retained her position as assistant at the
State Normal School for seven years, one at
Lexington antl six at West Newton (whither
the school was removed in 1844), and served
under three principals — the Rev. Cyrus Peirce,
the Rev. Sanuiel .1. May, and Eben S. Stearns.

In the interregnum between the resignation
of Mr. Peirce and the accession of Mr. Stearns,
Miss Lincoln served as principal of the school;
and it was the expressed wish of Mr. Peirce
that she should succeed him as permanent
principal. Miss Lincoln was thus the first
woman in the country to act as principal of
a State Normal School, but to make her the
permanent principal was too great an innova-
tion to be seriously thought of by those in
authority at that early day.

She was married to George Augustus Walton
on August 27, 1850. Mr. Walton at that time
and for a number of years after was principal
of the Oliver Grammar School in Lawrence,
Mass. Sub.sc(iuently, as a teacher in teachers'
institutes in New England, also in New York
and \'irginia, he became widely known and in-
Huential. For twenty-five years from 1871 he
was agent of the Massachusetts State Board of
Education. Mr. Walton is a graduate of the
liridgewater Normal School. He received the
degree of Master of Arts from Williams College.
Born in South Reading (now Wakefiekl), Mass.,
February 18, 1822, son of James and Elizabeth
(Bryant) \^^^lton, he is a lineal descendant of
the Rev. William Walton, whose services as
minister of the gospel at Marblehead covered
a period of thirty years, 1638-68.

For eighteen years after marriage Mr. and
Mrs. A\'alton r(\sided in Lawrence. A Unitarian
in religious faith, brought up under the pulpit
teachings of the Rev. Nathaniel Thayer, of
Lancaster, and the Rev. Dr. George Putnam,
of Roxbury, and later influencetl by the inspir-

iiig elocjuence of Theodore Parker, Mrs. Walton
devoted herself to benevolent and philanthropic
enterprises in her spare time, and was a leader
in church and charitable work. During the
Civil War, turning the sympathies of the Law-
rence people toward the Sanitary Connnission,
she aided in organizing the whole community
into a body of co-laborers with the army in
the field.

Having received thorough instruction in
vocal culture from Professors James E. Mur-
dock and William Russell, she was for years
employed as a teacher of reading and vocal
training in the teachers' institutes of Massa-
chusetts. She also taught in the State Normal
Institutes of Virginia, and for five successive
years, by invitation of General Armstrong,
conducted a teachers' institute of the gradu-
ating class in Hampton. Her belief in the right
of woman to be rated equally with man at her
own worth and be credited with her own work
was intensifietl by the decision of the publishers
that her name should not appear witli her hus-
band's on the title-page as co-author of the
arithmetics which were their joint production,
and led at length to earnest advocacy of equal
rights for the sexes. She was always zealous
in the temperance cause, and during a residence
in Westfield was president of the local branch
of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
Since the removal of Mr. and Mrs. Walton to
West Newton, where they now reside, Mrs.
Walton has been active in promoting woman
suffrage, believing that this will best advance
the interests of temperance and kindred re-
forms, and tend to the purification of politics.
She was for many years an officer of the Massa-
chusetts W^oman Suffrage Association, is a val-
ued member anil vice-president of the New Eng-
land Women's Club of lioston, for twenty years
was president of the West Newton Women's
Educational Club, organized in L8S0, and is
now on the Boanl of Directors of the Woman's
Club House Corporation. Although not a pro-
lific writer, she sometimes contributes to the
press. She is an interesting speaker and an
occasional lecturer upon literary and philan-
thropic subjects.

Mr. anil Mrs. Walton are the parents of five
children, of whom three are livmg: Harriet



Peirce, wife of ex-Judge James R. Dunbar,
of the Massachusetts Superior Court; Dr. George
Lincoln Walton (Harv. Univ., A.B. 1S75, M.D.
1880), neurologist, of Boston; and Alice Walton
(Smith Coll., A.B. 1887; Cornell, Ph.D. 1892),
now (1903) associate professor of Latin and
archa-ology at Wellesley College. Mr. and Mrs.
Dunbar have five children — namely, Ralph
Walton, Philip Richards, Ruth, Helen Lincoln,
and Henry Fowler.



LUCY MARIA JAMES, of New Bed-
ford, first Regent of the Captain Thomas
J Kempton Chapter, Daughters of the
Revolution, was born in Fairhaven,
Mass., March 1, 1841, daughter of William
and Maria Hartson (Caswell) James. She was
married August 10, 1865, to Henry B. James,
of New Bedford, son of John, .Ir., and Sylvia
(Kempton) James.

John James, Sr., father of John and Will-
iam, came as a sailor boy from England in
1805 or 1806. He married April 24, 1808,
Sally Dunham, of Dartmouth, Mass., where
he bought land and became a resident, but
continued for some time to follow the sea.
During the War of 1812 the vessel he was in
was captured by the English, officers and crew
being held as jirisoners. On reaching Ireland
he escajied, but was recaptured and imprisoned
in Cork. The date of his release is not given
in the family recoi'd. His son William was
born in Dartmouth in March, 1816.

Mrs. James's mother was the daughter of
Daniel Caswell, a soldier in the War of 1812,
and his wife, Sally Elliot, anil grand-daughter
of John and Betsey (Cain) Elliot. John
Elliot was a Revolutionary soldier, who was
wounded at the battle of Saratoga. He was
born in East Taunton, Mass., where he died
in 1843 at the age of ninety-six years.

The parents of Mrs. James moved to New
Bedford, Mass., when she was an infant, and
she received her education in the public schools
of that city. At the age of ten years she was
in great demand as a correspondent for those
who could not write.

Mrs. James has acted on the principle that
study should be a part of the every-day home

life. The poor, whom she has often visited
in their homes, have been instructed by her
teaching;s and aided by her generous con-
tributions. Her mother early encouraged
her in this laudable mission of helpfulness to
others. During the Civil War she offered
her services as an army nurse, but nu^t with
disap]K)intment, as she was too young to
perform official tluty in the hospitals. Many
a soldier, however, was provided with comforts
and luxuries through her zealous efforts at
home in their behalf. When a Relief Corps
auxiliary to William L. Rodman Post, No.
1, G. A. R., was formed in New Bedford,
Mrs. James enrolled her name on its charter
list. From the date of its institution, Sep-
tember 11, 1885, to the present time she has
devoted her best efforts to the patriotic and
charitable work, of the corps. Installed as
its president in January, 18S7, she filled the
office so successfully that she was re-elected
in 18S8 and 1889, and again in 1891 and in
1901. During the intervening years she
served successively as senior vice-president,
treasurer, and chaplain, willingly taking any
position in which she could advance the in-
terests of the corps. Mrs. James has served
on committees in many department con-
ventions, and has been a delegate to national
conventions. She has served as deixartment
aide by the appointment of seven deiiartment
presiilents, and has also served on the staff
of two national Relief Corps presidents. She
took the lead in organizing the liristol County
Association, an&lt;l was its first chajtlain. She
was elected president in October, 1890, and
served one year, at the close of which she
presented to the Association a beautiful gavel.
Mrs. James joined the order of King's Daugh-
ters in 1887, working independently for the
sailors until 1900, when she joined the Unity
Circle, K. D., of New Bedford. In 1890 she
was instrumental in forming the Ca})tain
Thomas Kempton Chapter of the D. R., of
New Bedford. Of this chapter she was ap-
pointed the first Regent, and continues in
the office, having been annually re-elected.

When the Spanish-American War began,
and the \'olunteer Aid Association of Massa-
chusetts was formed, Mrs. .lames gave her



efforts to the cause. She worked as secre-
tary of a connnittee representing Corps No.
53, and assisted in organizing the New Bedford
branch of the Adluntcer Aid Associatidu,
which accomplished a grand work. This
branch forwarded several hundred dollars'
worth of hosjiital su|)plies to the soldiers and
sailors, and contributed in aildition three
hundred dollars toward fitting out the hosjjital
shij), "Bay State." which was sent to Cuba
by the A'olunteer Aid Association of Massa-
chusetts to convey the sick antl wounded to
their homes. Mrs. James acted as advisory
connnittee during all this work in New Bedfonl,
rec(&gt;iving the respect and regard of the society,
whose members often referred to her as " our
Mrs. Livermore." When the war ended, and
active work was over, the money remaining
in the treasury of the New Bedford branch
was placed in charge of four trustees, of whom
Mrs. James was one. Several barrels of com-
fort bags, reading matter, and so forth, have
been forwarded by her on behalf of the trustees
to Porto Rico, Manila, and to the navy. The
wives and children of several soldiers have
also been cared for at home.

During the j^ast forty-two years Mrs. James
has contributed poems, essays, notes of travel,
items of news, to various periodicals. She
is a charter member of the Old Dartmouth
Historical Society, and has devoted nmch
time to historical and genealogical research,
Init amid all her varied interests has not
neglected her home duties.

Henry B. James, to whom she was married,
in 1865, as mentioned above, is a descendant
through his mother, Sylvia Kempton, of
I"-phraim' Kempton, Sr., who came to Plym-
outh some time between 1627 and 164)5,
and .settled in Scituate, wJiere he died in
May, 1645. h'phrainr Kempton, Jr., who
came over with his father ami was his partner
in l)usiness in Scituate (see Plymouth Colony
Reconls, vol. ii.), married in January, 1646,
Joanna, daughter of Thomas Rawlins. The
line was continued through their son Ephniim,'
who married Mary Reeves; Ephraim,' married
Patience, daughter of Elder Thomas^ Faunce;

lU'ii; George,'* married Rel)eei'a \\'eeks; to
Sylvia,' who married John James, Jr., and was
the mother of Henry B. James.

Mr. James is the author of a vohime en-
titled "Memories of the Civil War." In it
he says: "I have often wondered how it hap-
pened that I, born of Quaker stock on my
mother's side, should have had such a natural
leaning toward scenes of adventure and con-
flict. It may well have been that I inherited
it from the paternal side of the liouse." He
adds, speaking of his grandfather, Joim James,
Sr. : "During my childhood I often listened
to his tales of warfare and l)loodslu&gt;d, and
longed to be a man, that I miglit hglit and
avenge the wrongs inflicted on my devoted
country in its earlier days. As I read of the
War of the Revolution, I wished that I might
have lived in tho!«e stirring days and done
my part in creating the American nation."

Mr. James desired to enlist among the
first volunteers of the Union after the fall
of Fort Sumter, but his father would n(jt then
consent. He enlisted November 2, 1861,
just after his twentieth birthday, in Company
B, First Battalion, afterward the Thirty-
second Massachusetts Infantry. He was
mustered into the United States .service No-
vember 27, 1861, and on December 3 was
sent with his company to Fort Warren, Boston
Harbor, to guard piisoners of war, among
them being General Buckner, Commodore
Barron, Commissioners Mason and Slidell, and
the Mayor and Chief of Police of Baltimore.

On May 25 Company B left Fort Warren for
Washington. On July 4 the battalion of
which this company was a part was assigned
to the brigade of General Charles Griffin,
division of General Morell, in Fitz John Por-
ter's conmiand, afterward known as the Fifth
Army Corps. Mr. James was engaged in
thirty-eight battles — Antietam, I'^redericks-
burg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Mine
Run, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, the Wilder-
ness, and others. He was commissioned
Sergeant in February, 1864, was wounded in
a skirmish on the Boydton i)lank road March
30, 1865, and was in the Artn(&lt;ry Square
Hospital in Washington from April 2 to May
26, when he was transferred to White Hall,



on the Delaware River. He was able to
leave the hospital July 6, and received
an honorable tlischarge in Boston, July 18,
1865.

Mr. James is a past Senior Mce-Commantler
of William Logan Rodman Post, No. 1, G. A. R.,
of New Bedford, and has the esteem of all
his conu-ades.

Mr. and Mrs. James have had four sons
and one daughter, namely; Franklin Elliot,
born May 29, 1869; William Edgar, born
February 18, 1871 ; Clarence Henry, born
February 7, 1872; Percy Clifton, born Feb-
ruary 2, 1875; and Isabel Agnes, born October
19, 1881, died in infancy. The four sons
were educated in the public schools of New
Bedford, graduating from the high school,
anil are now in business in New Bedford.
They are mendiers of John A. Hawes Camp,
No. 35, Sons of Wterans, of New Bedford.

Franklin Elliot James married August 10,
1890, Helen E., daughter of Charles H. Gifford,
the celebrated marine artist. They have one
child, Isabel Ethel, born December 13, 1896.

William p]ilgar James married June 3,

MARTHA SEAVEY HOYT is a native
of h^ast Machias, Me., one of the sis-
ter villages planted a century and
a half ago on the banks of the two
rivers flowing through the Machias valley, by
a company of brave and stalwart men drawn
thither by the beauty of the .scenery, the broad
marshes covered with luxuriant grasses, ami
the stately forests of pine. Rising far back
in the lakes of the woods, the two rivers mingle



252

their waters two miles below, in the beautiful
Machias Bay, with its winding shores and out-
lying islands.

Here was the scene of the first naval l)attle
and victory of the Revolution, famous in the
annals of naval warfare for the reckless daring
of the undertaking and the desperate valor of
the hardy assailants, which alone achieved suc-
cess. Along the shores of the bay and the
banks of the rivers are still shown the grass-
grown ramparts, behind which those early
settlers resisted the British power, defended
their houses, and preserved to Maine the east-,
ern half of the State — an imperishable monu-
ment of the character and courage of " the fore-
fathers of the hamlet."

From this purely New England stock in
direct line, in the third generation, Mrs. Hoyt
traces her descent, and from such an inheri-
tance derives naturally those distinguishing
qualities so strongly displayed in the various
spheres of her activity and success. Of the
three potent influences chiefly instrumental in
shaping the lives and moulding the characters
of individuals — heredity, environment, educa-
tion — which in this instance has been most
powerful we have no occasion to consider, since
all seem to have been equally favorable. Of
the early and mare remote ancestry we have
alreaily spoken sufficiently. Coming down to
the immediate progenitors, the parents, Sylva-
nus and Cynthia 0. (Seavey) Seavey, were both
persons of marked individuality. Her father
was a man whose sterling honesty and intelli-
gence commanded the highest respect of his
contemporaries. Never seeking publicity nor
aspiring to official position, he made his influ-
ence felt in the conduct of public affairs and in
the stirring questions of the day. Strong in
his moral convictions and pronounced in his
opinions, without fear or favor, he stood firmly
on the ground of principle, and was always
found among the first and foremost of the tem-
perance reformers and the earliest abolitionists,
when these were names of reproach and ol)i()(iuy.
And the mother was no less distinguished for
her noble and womanly qualities. A most de-
voted wife and mother, and full of sympathy
for the suffering and afflicted, generous-hearted,
always watching for opportunities to do good



and to help others, especially the poor and
neetly, gentle in her manners, doing all this
quietly and with the spirit of love, she was
beloved by all. Of an active- mind, quick in-
telligence, and a most genial disposition, Mrs.
Seavey enlivened the home by her ready wit,
and was a most agreeable companion in all
social intercourse, retaining these qualities to
the last of her ninety years of existence.

Inheriting in a large degree the characteris-
tics of her Puritan ancestors — indepentlence in
thought and action, enterprise, and energy,
which grew with her growth and strengthened
with her strength — at an early age, with jnipils
mostly her senior, Martha Seavey entered
Washington Academy. An institution old and
well endowed, famous for its record of able in-
structors and still more for the many distin-
guished men and women it had trained and
sent forth into almost every walk of life during
the more than half-century of its existence, no
better fitting-school could be found for one's
life work.

Thus equipped with educational advantages,
she went forth to make a way and place for
herself in the workl, not unsuccessfully. A
fine oi)portunity soon offered for the exercise
of her gifts. A j'^oung minister, the Rev. Gil-
man A. Hoyt, wanting a competent helpmeet
for his chosen work, found in her the right
woman, admirably suited to the high vocation.
Thejf were married in East Machias, and im-
mediately started for their new field of labor in
the Far West. One year of successful labor in
Missouri and three more of arduous work on
the prairies of Kansas wore out the life of the
minister, leaving the young widow, with the
addition of a rich experience, to begin life anew
in a widely different sphere of activity. Boston
offered the most inviting field, and with her
pi'actical energy, natural business ability, self-
reliance, and knowledge gained of the world,
to win confidence and gain a permanent and
lucrative position was not a diflncult task for
Mrs. Hoyt. Here she found congenial occupa-
tion in one of the prominent newspaper offices,
where she labored with success until the death
of her father called her away to the perform-
ance of more sacred duties. With characteris-
tic devotion she then returned to her childhood

home to make the lives of those most dear to
her — an aged and feeble mother and an infirm
sister — as pleasant and happy as unwearied at-
tention and fidelity could effect.

The ancient homestead, standing apart from
the village in a wide field, with its avenue
shaded by evergreens, its scattered apple-trees
tough and gnarleil with age, and its old oaken
bucket hanging in the well by the kitchen door,
was rejuvenated without, and the house bright-
ened and adorned within. The aged mother,
now quite weak antl helpless in body, was the
centre of interest and the light of the home,
while with faculties unimpairetl, cheerful and
bright as in the earlier days, she enjoyed the
society of her numerous friends and the evening
readings, with their pastor, the Rev. H. F. Hard-
ing, as their guest, in which Browning was the
favorite author.

When the change came and the light of the
household was extinguished, Mrs. Hoyt re-
turned to Boston, made her a permanent home
there, and resumed her work in a much en-
larged sphere of public functions and respon-
sibilities. She was appointed special commis-
sioner by Governor AA'olcott. Being interested
in working for the soldi(M-s and soldiers' widows,
she applied to the Pension Bureau in Washington
for authority to tlo all pension work, and, being
able to fulfil all the requirements, was soon ap-
pointed pension attorney, an offtce granted to
very few women. In this work Mrs. Hoyt is
able to give cheer and comfort to many wi(lows'
hearts. From the aged and helpless, applica-
tions come to her with the preface, " I appeal to
you because you are a woman, knowing 1 shall
have your .sympathy"; and they are sure to
have it and, oftentimes, advice and assistance
without remuneration.

At the request of several owners of property,
Mrs. Hoyt added to her vocations that of real
estate. In this enterprise she has been very
successful in .securing the confidence ami re-
spect of all with whom she comes in contact.
She has the entire charge of the property,
handling it with skill. She is also working
for a ]iul)lishing company, and is correspondent
for several papers.

Mrs. Hoyt loses no opportunity to aid in any
movement for justice to women, sometimes by



a petition to the Legislature originated by her-
self, as in the present year, sometimes in a more
quiet way, but always with the one object in
view, of l)ringing women to the position they
should occupy, to be determined by personal
ability. Although her hands are very full, she
finds time for not only doing charitable work,
but for interesting others in large philanthropies.
Through her business she is enabled to call the
attention of wealthy people to worthy causes,
and thus obtain for them pecuniary aid. This
has been one of her achievements from early
girlhood, soliciting successfully, sometimes sur-
prisingly so, money for different worthy ob-
jects, never failing of the desired amount, and
going about it in a way that makes it a pleas-
ure to all concerned. Later in addition to her
other work Mrs. Hoyt signed a contract with
the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New
York, and became a representative in the Boston
office, working more particularly on the line of
the Gold Bond and Annuity, investments be-
coming popular with women.

Safe to say in conclusion, that, in addition to
her great executive ability and large resourceful-
ness, her cheerful disposition and happy faculty
of rendering herself agreealiie in business rela-
tions and also in social life have had much to
do with her successful achievement in all her
varied lines of effort.

Mrs. Hoyt is a member of the Boston Busi-
ness League, the Massachusetts Woman Suf-
frage Association, the Women's Educational
and Industrial Union, and the Underwriters'
Association of Boston.



MARY A. KOTZSCHMAR, wife of
the organist, conductor, and com-
{)0ser, Hermann Kotzschmar, of
Portland, has made for herself
an enviable reputation in the musical circles
of that city. She was born in Sacramento,
Cal., in 1852. Her parents, Midian Torrey
and Mary A. (Griffin) Torrey, were both of
good old New England stock, her mother
a native of Ellsworth, Me., and her father
of Deer Isle, Me. Mr. Torrey was one of the
"forty-niners," or gold hunters who went
in that year to seek their fortune in California.

Mrs. Torrey remained in .Sacramento while
her husband was at the mines. When but
twelve years of age Mrs. Kotzschmar lost
both her parents. Soon after, her uncle,
who was her guardian, brought her to Port-
land, Me., to be educated. She was placed
in a private school kept by Miss Prince, and
at the same time she began with Mr. Kotzsch-
mar her. nmsical studies, which she con-
tinued under his instruction until the time
of her marriage. Since that event their
combined professional career has been very
successful, and they now rank among well-
known New England nuisicians. Mrs. Kotzsch-
mar was among the first to attend the
clavier school in New York, and study the
method which has since become so generally
used. Recognizing the possibilities of this
method, .she was one of the first to introduce
it in Maine, and has employed it in all of
her teaching for the last ten years with much
success.

In 1896, accompanied by her daughter,
she travelled extensively in Europe, and
again in 1900 she spent several months abroad,
on both occasions stui lying under leading
instrumental teachers in Berlin. In addition
•to her success as a teacher of piano, she has
gained a reputation as a writer and lecturer.
She is also possessed of considerable executive
ability. Her first public work to be noted
was in the season of 1S94, when she gave a
•series of talks in Kotzschmar Hall on the
growth of music. The.se talks were first
arranged for lier pupils. The first one was
called "An Outline of the Growth of Music,"
and was followed by sketches of the music
of Italy, France, and Germany, illustrated
with songs. These have since been iTjieated
before leading musical associations through-
out the State. When the first Maine Musical
Festival was given in Portland, in 1897, Mrs.
Kotzschmar was honored with an invitation
to give her paper on the Growth of Music.
In 1895 she brought out, in Kotzschmar
Hall, that beautiful song-cycle, "In a Persian
Garden," by Liza Lehinann. Mr. ^'an "\'orx,
a tenor from New York, and Miss Katherine
Ricker, contralto, of Boston, were engaged
for the occasion, the other parts being sung



by Portland soloists. This was the first time
that the poem was presented in this country
except in New York City, and the first of
its being given with stagings to represent
a garden. This i)roved a most effective
feature, and ditl much toward making the
poem realistic.

While abroad, Mrs. Kotzschmar wrote
letters of travel for the Portland Fresn and
for the Kennebec Journal, in all about fifty.
Her clear manner and originality of style
gained her notice in literary circles. She
has also written, with success, for the Ladies'
Home Journal, and is a contributor to the
musical paper, L'l^tude. She wrote a little
book on the clavier and its method, which
was purchased by the Clavier Company, and
is used in their adverti.sements. .She was a
pioneer in Maine in introducing class work
for beginners, antl formed classes of eight
to ten children, ranging from five to twelve
years of age, to whom .she taught the rudiments
of music, sight reading, etc., giving them
a basis on which to work when beginning private
lessons. The success of this enterprise is
shown by the numerous cla.sses she now has.
Mrs. Kotzschmar is devoted to her art, antl
is .always busy planning something new to
keep the musical ]ieople in her vicinity alert
and in touch with the doings of the musical
world.

nized power in raih'oad circles all over the con-
tinent.

Mrs. Fcnwick accjuired her early education
in Louisville, and completed her preparatory
studies in Switzerland, where she was sent to
attentl school during the Civil War, when
Kentucky was in an unsettled condition. In
1866 .she was offered a position as teacher in
one of the public schools of Louisville, and 'in
the autumn she returned home to begin her
duties. In 1871, after five years of teaching,
she married Henderson Reno, of Louisville, Ky.
He died in 1876, ami in the fall of the same
year she resumed work as teacher in the public
schools of Louisville. She continued thus
employed for nine years, and in that time she
acquired a comprehensive knowledge of the
entire system of school work. Appointed
principal of one of the grammar schools in
January, 1886, she occupied this jiosition till
the sununer of 1891. She became the wife of
Dr. Joseph Benson Fenwick, of Chelsea, Mass.,
in July immediately after the close of the
school term, and has since inatle that city her
home.

She was elected to the School Board of Chelsea
in December, 1892, and has been re-elected
after each expired term since. Intelligent
and practical as an educator, conversant with
the best methods of foreign and American ped-
agogy, her counsel has been of inestimable value
to the instructors and the students of the
Chelsea schools.

She has served on all the important
conunittees, such as Course of Study, Text-
books, Supplies, High School (being chairman
of the High School Connnittee for two
years).

She has been an active memtaer of the Chelsea
Woman's Club since its organization, and is a
member of the Chelsea Fortnightly Club. She
holds the office of secretary in the Associated
Charities of Chelsea, and is a vice-president of
the Rufus S. p&gt;o,st Hospital Aid Association.
Mrs. Fenwick is a delightful conversationalist,
and hei jileasnig manners make her a social
favorite in the city, which gratefully acknowl-
edges her services.



ELIZABETH EATON BOIT, one of the
founders and owners of the Harvartl
Knitting Mill, Wakefield, was born in
Newton, Mass., July 9, 1849. Her
parents were James Henry and Amanda Church
(Berry) Boit, who were married May 7, 1846,
her mother being a daughter of Isaac and
Phoebe (Emerson) Berry, of Bridgton, Me.
Her paternal granclfather, John Boit, a native
of Boston, turned his attention to farming and
resided in (iroton, Mass. He married Rebecca
Wesson, and had a family of eleven children.

Miss Bolt's father was born in Groton, Au-
gust 13, 1824. He learned the trade of an en-
gineer, but later engaged in the paper manu-
facturing business at Newton Lower Falls for
many years. For twenty years he served as
janitor of the Hamilton School buikling at the
Lower Falls, and h.e was for a long period sexton
of Saint Mary's (Episcopal) Church. He died
January 16, 1899. Mr. and Mrs. James Henry
Boit celebrated the golden anniversary of their
wedding in 1896. They reared six daughters:
Julia Amanda, born April 12, 1847, who died
March 15, 1861; Elizabeth Eaton, the subject
of this sketch; Clara Rebecca, born February
3, 1851: Harriet Maria, born August 11, 1853;
Helen Augusta, born November 29, 1859; antl
Su.san Henrietta, born January 31, 1864, who
died May 4, 18S6. Clara R. married on Octo-
ber 20, " 1870, C.. W. Morse, of Newtonville,
Ma.ss.; Harriet M. married March 1, 1881, A. C.
AViswall, of Wellesley, Mass.; and Helen A.
married June 26, 1882, Dr. F. W. Freeman, of
Newton Lower Falls,

Elizabeth Eaton Boit pui'sued her elementary
studies in the Newton public schools; and after
her graduation from the grammar school she
took a two years' course at l^asell S. minary,
Auburndale. When eighteen years old she
accepted the position of timekeeper in the sew-
ing, or finishing, department of the Dudley
Hosiery Knitting Mill, Newton, of which H. B.
Scudder was at that time agent. The able and
whole-souled manner in which she performed
her duties .soon cau.sed her promotion to the
post of assistant forewoman, from which she
was shortly afterward advanced to the position
of forewoman: and in five years' time she was
given full charge of the finishing department.

When Mr. Scuckler established the Allstou Mills
at AUston, Mass., for the manufacture of ho-
siery and children's scarlet-wool goods, she ac-
cepted the supcrin tendency of the new enter-
prise, which she retained for five years, or until
the property was sold.

Desirous of connecting lierself with a busi-
ness in which she could have a personal finan-
cial interest, she formed a partnership with
Charles N. Winship, formerly of the Dudley
Mill and afterwanl foreman of the knitting
department of the Allston Mill. In 1888 the
firm of AVinship, Boit &amp; Co. established the
Harvard Knitting Mill at Cambridge, Mass.,
from which city they moved to Wakefield in
the following year, and resumed operations in
the Wakefielcl Block, occupying one floor.
They inaugurated their enterprise with a small
capital but with a thorough knowledge of the
business, Miss Boit assuming charge of the
finances as well as the general superintendency
of the finishing department, while Mr. Winshi])
attended to the knitting and other branches of
the work. The laudable aim of placing gooils
upon the market whicli .should be a credit to
themselves, serving also to elevate the stand-
ard of the American textile fabric industry,
resulted in securing such a wide popularity and
increasing demanil for the Harvard brand of
imderwear as to make necessary the enlarge-
ment of their facilities from time to time, until
they were at length compelled to erect a build-
ing for their exclusive use.

The present Harvard Knitting Mill, which
stands upon an acre of ground in the immediate
vicinity of the Wakefield station of the Boston
&amp; Maine Railway, was completed in 1897, and
is fully equippeil with modern machinery and
appliances for producing the highest quality
of knit goods. The building, which is of brick
and is one hundred and eighty-two feet long
by sixty-seven feet wide, with a three-story
wing, forty by thirty feet, contains three floors
and a basement. The basement is used for
storage purposes. The folding, packing, and
shipping are all done on the first floor, which
also contains the business oflnces. The sec(jnd
floor is devoted to the finishing department,
while the knitting room is located on the third
floor. There are in use one hundred and fifty-



five knitting machines, one hundred and twenty
sewing machines, eight looping machines, and
twenty winders, operated by a force of over
three hundred hands and producing five hun-
dred and fifty dozen articles daily. The prod-
ucts, which consist of cotton, cotton and silk,
woollen, and woollen and silk knit goods, arc
distributed to the retail trade by Messrs.
AVilliam Lselin &amp; Co., of New York City.

Miss Boit is said to be the only woman in
the United States who is actively engaged in
conducting a textile fabric manufactory. Al-
though her numerous business duties are so
exacting as to demand her closest personal
attention, she has found time to familiarize
herself with various other interests and insti-
tutions, among them the Ladies' Aid Society of
Massachusetts. She was for a time treasurer of
the Aged AA'omen's Home, and also of the
Kosmos Club (a local literary organization).
She is especially interested in tlie welfare of
yoimg girls, particularly those in her employ,
and avails herself of every opportunity to
furth(&gt;r the progress and well-being of the
wage-earners of her sex.



LUCY ANNE KIRK, M.D., a success-
ful homoeopathic physician of Boston,
_^ was born in Dorchester on March 31,
1859, daughter of Joseph and Eleanor
Hall (Stimpson) Kirk. Joseph Kirk, whose
ancestors were P]nglish, came to the United
States from Nova Scotia about the year 1845,
and followed the occupation of printer in
Boston throughout the remainder of his life.
Born in Halifax, October 7, 1821, he died in
Dorchester, May 16, 1863.

John Foster Kirk, of Philadelphia, brother
of Joseph and uncle to Dr. Kirk, was in early
life the amanuensis of Prescott, the historian,
later the editor of Lippincott's Magazine, the
writer of the History of Charles the Bold, and
the reviser of Allihone's Dictionary of Authors.
He is now engaged upon the revisal of Worces-
ter's Dictionary. The wife of John Foster
Kirk is the well-known author, Ellen Olney
Kirk.

FJeanor Hall Stimpson Was on the eve of
going South to take charge of a school of col-

ored children in Alabama, when Josej))! Kirk
|)roposed for her hand and was accepted, their
marriage taking place October 11, 1855. They
had three chihh-en, namely: Joseph, born Au-
gust 12, 1856, who died July 15, 1886; Lucy
Anne, the subject of this biography; and Elea-
nor Hubbard, born July 15, 1861, who is now
an esteemed instructor in the branch of the
Washington University at St. Louis, Mo.,
known as Mary Institute. Mrs. Kirk was
born in Boston, May 10, 1836. She died July
8, 1876.

Dr. Kirk's maternal grandparents were John
and Lucy Richards (Davies) Stimpson. James
Stimpson, who came from England and set-
tled on Cowdrey's Hill, in that part of the old
town of Reading, Mass., which is now Wake-
field, was a physician. He married in 1661
Mary Leffingwell (sometimes spelled Leping-
well). From Dr. James Stimpson Dr. Kirk
traces her descent through John Stimpson,
who married Mary Wadsworth, of Milton, and
died in the town in 1732; their .son, Recompense
Wadsworth Stimpson, born in Milton in Feb-
ruary, 1728, who married Susanna Blodgett
in 1759; Charles Stimpson, born in Boston in
1766, who married Eleanor Hall, and was the
father of John, above named, whose wife was
Lucy R.- Davies.

Eleanor Hall, the wife of Charles Stimpson,
was a daughter of Captain Lsaac and Abigail
(Cutter) Hall. Her father was son of Andrew
and Abigail (Walker) Hall and grandson of
John, Jr., and Jemima (Syll) Hall. John Hall,
father of John Hall, Jr., came from England
with his widowed mother, Mary Hall, who
joined the church in Cambridge, Mass., in 1662,
and received land from the town. In 1675
John Hall bougiit land in Medford. He mar-
ried Elizabeth Green. Jemima Syll, the wife
of John Hall, Jr., an;l mother of Andrew Hall,
was a daughter of Captain Joseph and .Jemima
(Belcher) Syll. Her father, whose name was
sometimes spelled Sill, was an ofhcer in King
Philip's War. Her mother was a daughter
of Andrew Belcher, and as sister of Andrew
Belcher, Jr., was aunt to his .son. Governor
Jonathan Belcher.

Isaac Hall, of Medford, father of Eleanor,
the wife of Charles Stimpson, was an active



patriot during the struggle for American in-
dependence. His record, as printed in " Mas-
sachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolu-
tionary War," vol. vii., is as follows; "Captain
of a CO. in (late) Col. Thomas Gardner's regt.,
which assembled April 19, 1775; service 5 days;
also Captain, same regt., list of officers in said
regt. recommended by Committee of Safety
to be connnissiQned by Congress; ordered in
Provincial Congress, June 2, 1775, that com-
missions be delivered to said officers; also Cap-
tain, Lt. Col. William Bond's (late Col. Gard-
ner's) 37th regt., company return dated Camp
Prospect Hill Oct. 6, 1775, represented dis-
chargetl Sept. 1775; also Captain, service 4
days; company marched from Medford, by
order of Gen. Washington at the time of the
taking of Dorchester Heights, March, 1776."

It is related of Captain Hall that the com-
pany that he connnanded l)efore the Revo-
lution had been formed by himself, and that
it was his custom to supplement the meagre
pay received by his men from the government
by supplies of clothing paid for out of his own
pocket.

John Stimpson, son of Charles and Eleanor,
was born in 1795 in Richmond, Va. He mar-
ried in Boston, May 29, 1825, Lucy Richard
Davies, who was born in Boston in 1799. She
was the daughter of Joshua Gee Davies and
his wife, Lucy Richards, and on the paternal
side grand-daughter of the Rev. Nathan and
Susanna (Gee) Davies.

The Rev. Nathan Davies was pastor of the
church in Dracut, Mass., from 1765 to 1781.
Susanna Gee, whom he wedded April 3, 1766,
was born in Boston, November 18, 1740, and
baptized in the Second Church, November 23,
when she was five days old. She was daugh-
ter of the Rev. Joshua Gee by his third wife,
Sarah Gardner. Her father served for twenty-
five years (1723-48) as minister of the Sec-
ond Church in Boston, as colleague of Cotton
Matlier till 1729 antl afterward as his succes-
sor. Born in Boston in 1698, son of Joshua
and Elizalieth (Thornton) Gee, he was grad-
uated at Harvard College in 1717.

His father, Joshua Gee, was son of Peter
Gee, an inhabitant of Boston in early colonial
times. A family tradition has it that Joshua



258

Gee "woukl have been a dangerous man if he
had not been a very lazy one." By occupa-
tion he was a boat-builder. It is related of
him that he was once captured by Algerines,
that he escaped from captivity by the agency
of an Algerine woman, and that thereafter
he celebrated the anniversaries of the event
with a dinner, at which a turkey was served
bound in links of sausage, as a reniinder of
the chains he wore in Algiers.

Judge Sewall in his Diarj', under date Jan-
uary II, 1714-5, states that he dined at Mr.
Gee's on that day in company with Drs. In-
crease and Cotton Mather, Mr. Thornton, Mr.
Wadsworth, and others, and says: "It seems
it was in remembrance of his landing this day
at Boston after his Algerine captivity. Had
a very good treat."

At an earlier date, October 31, 1688, he re-
cords : " Joshua Gee launches to-day, ami his
ship is called the Prince."

And 1692, Friday, September 30: "Go to
Hog Island with Joshua Gee and sell him three
white oaks for thirty shillings. I am to cart
them to the water side."

The Gee tomb in Copp's Hill Burial Ground
bears the family name and coat of arms.

Fatherless since the age of four years. Dr.
Kirk is indebted to her mother almost exclu-
sively for her moral and mental development
throughout the period of her life preceding
that of womanhood. Her elementary educa-
tion was received in the public schools of Dor-
chester, while further instruction was given
her at home by her mother personally. Of
a keenly sympathetic nature from infancy,
a tendency to relieve suffering became a marked
characteristic of her girlhood.

When she was eleven years old, she announced
to all whom it might concern that she intended
to become a nurse. When of suitable age she
entered the training-school for nurses at the
Hartford (Conn.) Hospital; and after her grad-
uation, in 1883, she spent the ensuing years
in Hartford, employed in her chosen calling.

Later, desiring to attain the highest degree
of her girlhood's ambition, she took the course
in homoeopathy at the Medical School of Boston
University, and received her degree of Doctor
of Medicine in 1893. Dr. Kirk will be readily



remembered by her classmates at the univer-
sity by her successful advocacy of the adoption
of the cap and gown, which they were the first
to wear, or as being the writer of the class poem
entitled "Cap and Gown," delivered at a class
supper and afterward published in the Medical
Student. After receiving her tliploma Dr.
Kirk went to New York ami pursued a post-
gratluate course in the New York Post-gradu-
ate School of Medicine. Then she returned
to Boston, and, establishing her residence
in the Dorchester district, entered upon the
tluties of her new profession.

She has ac(juired a lucrative ])ractice, cov-
ering a territory extending to Neponset and
Marblehead on one side and to Cambridge and
Maiden on the other. Her physical fitness for
her work is testified by her excellent health.

For .several years she was associated with
Dr. Alonzo Boothby in the Boothby Hospital,
Boston, wherein her duties included the de-
livery of lectures to nurses. Her income is
far from being an adequate measure of her
professional work. Following the best tradi-
tions of the profession, she frequently gives
her services gratuitously to needy patients.
She has been on the staff of the Homoeopathic
Medical Dispensary of Boston since 1894,
and by the request of school-teachers of Dor-
chester she has given hygienic talks to mothers
in Dorchester.

Dr. Kirk is a member of the Massachusetts
Homoeopathic Society, of the Boston Homoeo-
pathic Society, of the Massachusetts Surgical
and Gyna'cological Society, and of the Twen-
tieth Century Medical Society. Her religious
affiliations are with the Episcopal church. She
is a patron of the Girls' Friendly Society. In
1897 she was admitted to membership in the
patriotic society known as the Daughters of
the Revolution.



FLORENCE GARRET1&gt;50N SPOONER,
President of the Massachusetts Prison
Reform League, has been a resident of
Boston the past thirty-two years, her
home being in a quiet corner where West End
and Back Bay meet, at the lower end of Pinck-
ney Street.

Flurt'iicc (ianvttsou Spoouur was horn in
Baltimore. On lier mother's side she is de-
scen(l(&gt;(l IVom one of the most noted families
of colonial history in Marj'land. Her ancestors
were of the Dorsey, Worthington, Howard, and
Hammond connection, which united the best
blood of the State. One of her great-furand-
fathers was William liall, closely related to
the mother of \\'ashiiigton. The (iarrettsons,
on her father's side, weie among the earliest
settlers of Maryland and New York. In the
year 1752 the Rev. Freeborn Garretson gave
up his grants of land, an&lt;l freed his slaves
through religious convictions. He became a
missi(jnary of the Methodist J'4)isc()])al Ohurch,
travelling from the Oarolinas to Nova Scotia
on horseback. His wife, Katherine Livingston,
was a daughter of .ludge Livingston and sister
to Robert R. Livingston, the first Chancellor of
New York.

Mrs. Spooner in girlhood and early woman-
hood was devoted to music, using her rare
voice in many choirs as a gift of love, and be-
longing to the most exclusive musical clubs.
Her natural talent for organization made her
a centre of attraction, where she stood at the
helm of many church and society functions.
With further knowledge and experience her
life broadened and character developed. She
served on philanthrojjic conunittees, thus turn-
ing into practical channels her symiiathetic
and over-al)undant compassion for the sorrows
and needs of unfortunates. An earnest and
enthusiastic worker in her chosen fiekl of re-
form, efficient in many ways, she has been de-
scribed as "a religious, consuming .soul, always
in communication with the authorities of Church
and State, goin&lt;j; straight -on, radiating in a
hundred directions, bringing forces to bear on
the whole circumference of unusual cruelties.
The doors have fallen, and light has illuminated
dark places: and she will succeed in what she
undei'takes because she has just that faith that
will remove mountains, the mountains of [Heju-
dice and persistence." Time and the Hour says:
" Florence Spooner's name has become as fam-
ous as Elizabeth Fry and Dorothea Dix, antl
her charity has taken the form of divine fire."

Mrs. Spooner has studied untiringly the
prison system in America. Her huuiane and



practical rtniuests lunc .seldom been denied.
She has succeeded in getting notable people
together at important houses and in the-chapels
of leading churches. Bishops, governors, and
other officials have so recognizeil her great
earnestness, sincerity, anil simplicity that they
have been moved to say the right word at the
right time: and for this reason she insists that
the credit for the successful agitation and
awakening of the public conscience to the
evils existing in the prisons belongs to the wise
men of a marvellous century.

In 1894 Governor Greenhalge gave his sup-
port to her cau.se by presiding at a meeting
wlieic three subjects were especially advocated
— al)olition of dungeons (dark cells), the in-
determinate sentence, and the supplanting of
hou,ses ol correction by reformatories. Prison
conuni.ssioners and representatives of the l-'rison
Association and other organizations participated
in the discussion. This meeting, the first held
by the Prison I^etorm League, was arranged by
Mrs. Spooner, .Mrs. .James T. Fields, and Miss
Mason. Among other conferences held by Mrs.
Spooner and her co-workers was one at Trinity
Church Chapel, presided over by Mayor
Quincy.

The successful work accomplished by Mrs.
Spooner toward the abolishment of dark cells
in the city prisons and the gootl done by her
was specially commended by Dr. Alfred B.
Heath, Conunissioner, Institutions Department
of the City of Boston, in 1896. Penal Com-
missioner Ernest .C. Marshall has also officially
endorsed her beneficent work. The League
has agitated the subject of tlie present system
of fines for drunkenness, which they consider
as indefensible. Tlie Police Conunission re-
sponded pn-mptly to their request for co-oper-
ation, and Chairman Martin invited Mrs.
Spooner, Mr. Piobert Treat Paine, Conunissioner
Marshall, and a Sister of St. Margaret's to make
a midnight toiu' of inspection of station-house
cells as a stii&lt;ly of the subject.

In 1896-97, under the guidance of leading
men, wise and con.servative, she engaged in
the movement to aliolisli capital punishment,
resulting in the substitution of the electric chair
for the scaffold. She oi-ganized the Anti-Death
Penalty League in 1897, and, after the first



260



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



twenty signatures were obtained, names were
forwarded her in such numbers that it was
impossible for one person to keep the records.
Mrs. Spooner wrote numerous letters to experts
throughout the country, and secured valuable
facts that resulted in the formation of this
League. The following triljute to her work is
co]ji(Ml from an editorial in a Boston paper: —

"The brave attacks that have been made
by a Massachusetts woman against prison evils
interfering with physical, moral, and mental
improvement, have not merely been approved
in this country, but they have attracted at-
tention on the other side of the ocean. Now,
through her efforts, a tour of investigation is
being made through the South to in([uire into
prison systems and the measures that are used
to reform criminals of both sexes. The camp
life, for instance, with its vicious environments,
offers little chance for t)etter living or enil)rac-
ing any religious instruction. The men in chain
gangs who are hired out for work and exposed
to the public gaze and cruel criticism do not,
as a rule, know the meaning of the word ' en-
couragement.' Their existence is often a hell
on earth, and the wonder is, they survive its
degradation as long as they do. The hope of
improving and elevating inmates of prisons
may be fallacious, sentimental: but, unless im-
provement is achieved l^y some such endeavor,
humanity hapjiier in its surroundings must be
the sufferer. It is to vigilant reform that North,
South, East, and West now look for inspiration
for the ways and means that will elevate
character, even when paying its penalty for
crime.''

The League does not rest content that the
agitation has abolished the long-approved
gallows, nor does it accept as true that elec-
trocution is one step in advance.

Mrs. Spooner has presented able arguments
before the Joint Judiciary Committee of the
Massachusetts Legislature, has arranged many
hearings, distributed literature, and written
hundreds of articles upon the subject so near
her heart. She has received numerous requests
from libraries for copies of her sociological
writings.

No higher estimate of this work of charity
can be found than in the annual report of the



penal institutions commissioner to the mayor
of the city of Boston in 1899, under the head
of "Reform of Women Inmates." "A most
encouraging work has been done by Mrs. Flor-
ence Garrettson Spooner, the President of the
Prison Reform League. Recognizing her earn-
est sympathy for female prisoners, I appointed
her in the early part of 1898 to do such work
as missionary among the female inmates of
the House of Correction as she might think
proper looking toward their reformation. I
have been nuich jiieased with hei' work there.
The most hardened women have softened under
the beneficent influence with which she has
surrounded them. No better measure of her
work can be shown than the decrease in the
punisliments among the class with which she
works."

In literary work and on the platform as a
lecturer she is straightforward aiul perfectly
at ease in discussing all phases and points of
prison reform. Because of her tact, amiability,
and encouragement to prisoners she has the
confidence of officials and special privileges to
study human nature from the inside of the
prison, accorded to no other woman in the
State, prison commissioners excepted.

She was appointed by Governor Greenhalge
one of the colonial conmiittee of twelve from
Massachusetts to the Cotton States and Inter-
national Exposition at Atlanta, Ga. Mrs.
Spooner is now in the prime of life and in active
service. She has received the spontaneous co-
operation of others in her noble work.

Her husband, Henry T. Spooner, a studious,
busy man, devoted to his books, gives cordial
sym])athy and practical suj)port to the work
in which his wife is engaged. Mr. Spooner was
boni in Brooklyn, N.Y., son of Henry Pierson
and Emma (Brittan) Spooner. His father was
a descendant of the Aldens, Germaynes, and
Cottons. His mother was the daughter of
Thomas Standfast Bi'ittan, a clergyman who
left England and became rector of a church in
Brooklyn.

In the annual report of the ])enal institutions
commissioner, Alpheus Sanford writes to the
Hon. Patrick A. Collins, Mayor of the city of
Boston, that Mrs. Spooner was known through-
out the House of Correction as the "women's

missionary friend," rcconunonding that the
results of her work be recof^nized in future
and designated the Florence Spooner Prison
Mission.

"The initial and dominant impulse, abiding
power, and persistent energy which characterize
the reform work of Mrs. Spooner are not merely
the result of humanitarian feelings and ijhilan-
thropic tendencies. They are largely due to her
vivid conception of the religious duty of helping
the weak and erring in the spirit and purpose
of the great evangelical teacher and model of
brotherly love, all-embracing charity, and zeal
for the happiness of human souls in time and
eternity."



HELEN ISABEL DOHERTY, M.D.,
whose noble and efficient service
in the Spanish-American War has
made her widely known and loved,
was born in Boston, October 24, 1871. She
is the daughter of Colonel Thomas Francis
and Mary (Kerwin) Doherty, both natives of
Boston. She received her early education
in the city's public schools, being graduated
when very young from the high school and
immediately entering upon the advanced course.
Her desire to adopt the medical profession was
not at first encouraged by her parents, but,
as Colonel Doherty perceived that the longing
was no whim but a steadfast purpose, he ex-
amined the workings of various colleges, and
placed his daughter in the Women's Medical
School of Philadelphia, where she was grad-
uated in 1895, the youngest in her class. It
is interesting to note that on her mother's
side of the family there is a long line of physi-
cians.

Dr. Doherty began practice at the South End
in Boston in 1896, and probably few physi-
cians so young as she have had the varied and
wide experience -that is hers to-day. She does
a large amount of examining for insurance
companies, and was the first woman to be
employed by the leading fraternal societies.
She is examiner and visitor for the patients
in the Free Home for Consumptives in Dor-
chester. Boston was the first city to build
free gynmasia for women and children, and the



first medical director appointed in any of these
was Dr. Doherty.

In August, 1898, the Spanish War being
practically over, typhoid and Cuban fever
were raging, and "pestilence-stricken troops to
the number of forty-five thousand were quar-
antined at Montauk Point, Long Island.
Skilled treatment was necessary. There was
need of woman's care and wit. In answer to
telegrams sent by General W^heeler, Drs. Laura
A. Hughes and Helen I. Doherty directly re-
ported for duty, taking with them some thirty
or forty nurses. At Detention Camp and
the general hospital on the bleak hill-top
this yovmg woman, fresh from a home of re-
finement and luxury, lived the life of the com-
mon soldier, ate from the same rations, and
proved every hour of the day that the oath
of allegiance she had taken was no empty vow.
She did all the desk work, answering letters
and telegrams, preparing all the official rec-
onls for the Major, to be sent to Washington.
Beside taking charge of the Red Cross sup-
plies, distributing fruit, and receiving visitors,
she kept herself accurately informed of every
man's name and condition, for she had fre-
quently to identify mothers' sons for them,
so sadly changed were they by the ravages of
disease. So perfectly did she have this work
in hand that, as each captain came to the hos-
pital, she could lead him to his own men.
Naturally systematic and possessed of more
than ordinary executive ability, she was surely
the right woman in the right place. She was
always practical; and Moffett, in his maga-
zine "Camp Stories," thus spoke of her re-
sourcefulness and her varied activities : " She
not only nursed the sick, but looked after ac-
counts, made out bills, was clerk, dressmaker,
and laundress, and kept such a mass of detail
in her head that the nurses all went to her for
all sorts of things, from a tooth-brush to a
bottle of ginger ale."

She kept at her post so long as a patient
remained, and unfortunately brought with
her to Boston the seeds of typhoid. Weak-
ened by constant work day and night, she was
brought very low by the illness, and for weeks
it looked as if her devotion to duty was to cost
her her life, liul youth and vitality con-

quered, and she is to-day actively engaged in
her profession, which she loves, and in which
she has already made for herself a name.



SARAH PRATT McLEAN GREENE was
born in Simsbvuy, Conn., in 1856, daugh-
ter of Dudley Bestor and Mary (Payne)
McLean. Her father was a son of the
Rev. Allan McLean and his first wife, Sarah
Pratt, and a descendant in the fourth genera-
tion of Allan' McLean, a native of the island of
Coll, Argyleshire, Scotland, who sailed from
Glasgow in 1740, arrived in Boston in Septem-
ber, and settled in Connecticut.

Allan' McLean married in 1744 Mary Loomis,
a descendant of Joseph' Loomis, of Windsor,
Conn. Their son. Captain Alexander^ McLean,
married in 1768 Johanna Smith, and resided
in North Bolton, now Vernon, Conn. Their
fifth child, the Rev. Allan McLean, born in
1781 (Yale College, 1805), was pastor of the
Presbyterian church in Simsbury for fifty years.
He was a man of wealth for those days. But
he loved his worldly possessions only as they
benefited others. After a busy and useful life
he died in 1861, "full of years" and greatly
beloved.

Mrs. Mary Payne McLean, the mother above
named, now a widow, residing in Simsbury,
was born in Canterbury, Conn., being the daugh-
ter of Solomon and Hannah (Bishop) Payne.
On the paternal side she is a descendant of
Thomas Paine, of Eastham, Mass., and num-
bers among her ancestors Stephen Hopkins
and his daughter Constance, who both came
in the "Mayflower" in 1620, and Nicholas
Snow, who came in the "Ann" in 162.3.
Through these early colonists she is akin to
not a few Cape Cod folk of the present day.

Thomas Paine came over when a lad of ten
or twelve years (tradition says, with his father,
of the same name). He married, about 1660,
Mary, daughter of Nicholas' and Constance
(Hopkins) Snow. Their son, Elisha'^ Paine,
married Rebecca^ Doane, grand-daughter of
Deacon John' Doane, of Plymouth and luist-
ham, who served seven years as Deputy to the
General Court, .\bout the year 1700 Elisha"
Paine removed to Canterbury, then a pai't of



Plainfield, Conn. (Some of his descendants,
as seen below, have spelled the name Payne.)
His son Solomon,' horn in Eastham, was or-
dained in 1746 as pastor of the Separate church
in Canterbury. Solomon,'' born in 1733, son
of the Rev. Solomon' and his second wife,
Priscilla Fitch, was a farmer in Canterliury. He
married Mary Bacon and was father of Elisha,'^
born in 1757 (Yale College, 1780), who married
Anna Dyer. Elisha^ Payne and his wife Anna
were the parents of Solomon," named above,
father of Mrs. McLean.

Mrs. Priscilla Fitch Payne was a grand-
daughter of the Rev. James Fitch, of Say-
brook and Norwich, Conn., and his second
wife, Priscilla Mason, daughter of Major John
Mason, of Norwich, for many years com-
mander of the colonial forces and nine years
(1660-69), Deputy Governor of Connecticut.

Dudl(&gt;y B. and Mary P. McLean had five
children, all born at the McLean homestead in
Simsbury. The eldest child, Hannah Bishop
McLean, married William H. Greeley, and for
some years resided in Lexington, Mass. She
is now a widow living in Cambridge, her son
being a student at Harvard. Charles Allen
McLean (deceased) is survived by his wife and
two children. John Bunyan McLean, educa-
tor, is now a professor in the Westminster
School in Simsbury. (ieorge Payne McLean,
lawyer, born in October, 1857, was Governor
of Connecticut in 1901 and 1902.

Sarah Pratt McLean, the fourth child in this
family of five, grew up under careful home
training. She attended both district and pri-
vate schools during her childhood, but studied
far more with her mother, a woman of broad
culture. The old Pvu'itan ideas and ideals pre-
vailed in the McLean household. The sacred-
ness of th(&gt; Sabbath was impressed on the
children's minds, and the parents strove to
have all the influences of that home good and
elevating. Books there were in plenty, and
wlien Sarah, or Sally, as .she was called, was sent
to Mount Holyoke Seminary, she was well
equipped to do good work. Her mind was
stored with general reading. She knew and
loved nature, and was frankly interested in
all her new experiences. The rules were rigid
at Holyoke, and some of the regulations seemed



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



263



irksome, even to one brought up in a Presby-
terian minister's family. But she stood well
in her classes, and made warm friends of girls
anil teachers. Even at this time her literary
talent showed itself, and one of the poems
which she handed in as a composition was sent
away by her teacher for publication. The
verses called "De Massa ob de Sheepfol" she
wrote when she was only a young girl, though
they were never printed until they were put
into the mouth of Mxanna, a character in her
second book, "Towhead."

She remained at Mount Holyoke two years.
A classmate who had left school earlier to
teach on Cape Coil, being unable to continue
with the work, urged Miss McLean to take the
school. She decided to do so, nmch to the sur-
prise of her family; and, almost before they
could accustom themselves to the idea, she had
gone to the scene of her labors. She found her-
self amid surroundings that were full of strange-
ness. Sailors on .shore were a new type to her.
The idioms of the people, their customs and
traditions, impressed her with their novelty.
For five months she taught and learned at
Cape Cod. After reaching home, she used, at
odd moments, to put upon paper recollections
of these months, until they took on the form
and sequence of a book. Since this was done
simply for her own entertainment and with no
thought that the manuscript would meet other
eyes than her own, she used the familiar names ;
and, when the story seemed finished, .she put
it in a box, and shoved it away on an ujiper
shelf in her grandfather's library, dismissing
the matter from her mintl. A kinsman living
in Boston, in touch with the makers of books,
happening to express the desire that Miss
McLean would write .something for publication
(since he had noticed that she was a most
clever letter-writer), she took the manuscript
down from the library shelf, and, without con-
sulting any one, nailed a cover on the same
little wooden box which had held the loose
sheets all this time, and drove to the village
express office to speed the literary venture on
its way. Then she returned home to await
the verdict. The suspense was brief . The pub-
lisher sat all night over the manuscript, and
wrote the next morning that he wished to bring



it out at once. Miss McLean informed him
that the names were familiar in the locality
where she had been; but he was a young mem-
ber of the hrm, and it was his first venture in
publishing, as it was hers in novel-writing.
The story, moreover, was ideal and not intended
to be taken literally. For these reasons suffi-
cient importance was not attached to the fact
that local names were used. The book met
with great favor, passing from edition to edi-
tion. But presently the people on the Cape
began to show that they felt themselves ag-
grieved. This caused the author the keenest
pain. She could not forgive henself then, nor
can she now. Still there was "naught set down
in malice," and surely the gracious pictures of
their deeper experiences are depicted with so
gentle a touch that it would seem the sketcher
and the sketched might still across "the narrer
neck o" land" clasp friendly hands. Her pub-
lishers were desirous to have something further
from her pen, and she hurriedly prepared a
second book, "Towhead." Stories under her
name appeared at intervals in various maga-
zines, and a compilation of these formed her
third volume, which was called " Some Other
Folks." She had written two others, "Last-
chance Junction" and "Leon Pontifex," when
in 1887 she became the wife of Franklin Lynde
Greene, a Westerner, educated at Annapolis.
In the West, where she spent her married life
of a few brief years, twin boys were born to
her, but of these she was soon bereft. In 1890
Mr. (ireene died, and, widowed and childless,
Mrs. Cireene returned to New England. Several
ensuing years were passed in rest and travel.
She took a European trip, and subseiiuently
tarried at different points in Nova Scotia, vis-
iting also various parts of Maine. It was after
these summers in Maine that she wrote " Vesty
of the Basins," a book that has had phenomenal
success. In this ca.se, though local characters
are sketched with a free hand, and the ilwellers
in a small place know that their own manners
and lives furnish the basis of the story, they
read its pages with delight, and their frequent
letters of appreciation show the deep love they
bear the author. A well-known Engli,shman
says of "Vesty" : " I have read it a dozen times,
and 1 shall probably read it a dozen times

more. A\"ith each ic-reading I am struck anew
with its wonderfully strong portrayals of char-
acter and the sjiarkling wit and humor that
alternate so subtly with the writer's (lee|-i,
pathetic insight into life's mysteries. To my
mind it is the great American novel." " Vesty,"
as well as "Cape Cod Folks," has been recently
dramatized.

In fairly rapid succession Mrs. Greene wrote
"Stuart and Bamboo," "The Moral Imbeciles,"
and "Flood Tide." In 1902 was published by
Harper &amp; Brothers "Winslow Plain," a pict-
ure of life in a quaint New England village
fifty years ago, a story "told as Mrs. Greene
alone can tell it, with the brightest ojitimism."
In this book are found some rare poetic gems.
One special charm, indeed, of all this writer's
works consists in the many beautifvil, helpful
pa.ssage.s — (juite aside from the enthralling in-
terest of the story itself — that one desires, to
read again and again. Said a certain apprecia-
tive critic, " I never i-ead any of Mrs. Greene's
stories without longing to see all these fine,
quotable extracts collected in a volume by
themselves, a volume to which I could turn
whenever I feel 'the blues' coming on."

.Mrs. Cireene is a woman of fine presence,
with a face which bears beauty, merriment, and
tenderne.ss. She tells a story with exceptional
skill, in a voice so rich toned and musical that
it might belong to a Southerner.



SARAH P:LIZABETH FIELDING,
a prominent member of the Woman's
Relief Corps of Somerville, is a native
of Andover, Mass. The daughter of
Charles Nathan and Hannah Ja(|uith (Abbot)
Ingalls, she is a descendant in the ninth gen-
eration of Edmund Ingalls, who, with his
brother Francis, came from England to Massa-
chusetts in 1629, and in 1638 went to Lynn,
where they had a grant of one hundred and
twenty acres of land. They were among the
first settlers of that now prosperous city, and
were successful as farmers, stock-raisei-s, and
tanners of leather. The home of Francis was
in that part of Lynn which is now Swampscott.
He finally removed to Boston, where he died,
leaving no male heirs. Edmund Ingalls, as



stated in Lewis's History of Lynn, was drowned
in March, 1648, by falling with his hor.se through
the old Saugus River Bridge on Boston Street.
His estate was valued at one hundred and
thirty-five pounds, eight shillings, ten pence.

He had nine children: and Mrs. Fielding's

February 25, 1762, and died July 9, 1837. He
married in 1792 Sarah Berry, of Andover.
Francis,' born August IS, 1793, the eldest of
their four chiklren, dk'd at his home in North
Andover in November, 1S50. He married in
1815 Elizabeth Barker Foster, daughter of
Nathan" Foster, of North Andover, Mass.
Nathan" was a descendant, through Stephen,''
John," Ephraim,^ Abraham,- of Reginald' P\)ster,
an early settler of Ijxswich, Mass. (For further
particulars concerning Reginald and other Foster
immigrants in colonial days, and their descentl-
ants, see " Foster Genealogy," by F. C. Pierce.)
John Foster, printer, of Boston, was son of
another early colonist, Ho])estilF Foster, of
Dorchester; and Elizabeth Foster, who married
Isaac Vergoo.se in 1692, was the daughter of
Captain William' Foster, of Charlestown.

ing in 1861, he served in the Union army six-
teen months, when he was honorably discharged

on account of illness resulting from sunstroke
at Ball's Bluff. He was an ardiitect and
buikler, and previous to the Civil War had
charge of the construction of important works
on the Connecticut River and of public build-
ings elsewhere. In 1864 he superintended
government work in Tennessee, and was pres-
ent at the battle of Nashville.

Returning to Danvers, he was appointed
master carpenter of the Eastern Railroad,
which position he held fifteen years, when he
accepted a similar appointment on the North-
ern Pacific Railroad, antl removed to Dakota.
He subsequently went to the Yellowstone Park,
and erected the large hotel at Mammoth Hot
Sjirings. He consti'ucted m.any bridges and
buiklings on the branches of the Northern
Pacific Railroad. His last work was on the
Duluth and Manitoba Railroad, with head-
quarters at Hawlev, Minn., where he died in
1886.

He was a prominent Free Mason, a member
of Amity Lodge and Holten Royal Arch Chap-
ter, of Danvers, of Pilgrim Connnandery, of
Lowell, Mass., and was also a thirty-.second
degree Mason, Scottish Rite. His funeral was
conducted by the Rev. Ceorge J. Sanger, of
Essex, and he was buried at Danvers with .Ma-
sonic honors. He married . Hannah .Jaquith
Abbot, of Andover, by whom he had four chil-
dren, namely: Sarah l"]lizabeth, the subject of
this sketch; George W.: Frank; and Albert.
His wife died in 1868, and he married Mi.ss
Mary J. Morse, of Andover, Me., by whom he
had one son, Charles.

It may be added as worthy of mention that
Jonathan Ingalls, grandfather of Charles
Nathan, was brother to Theodore Ingalls,
grandfather of the late John J. Ingalls, of
Kansas, United States Senator.

Sarah Elizabeth Ingalls was born in Andover,
November 8, 1846. Her parents .subset [uently
removed to Danvers, and she was graduated
from the high school of that town. She mar-
ried July 9, 1874, George Washington Fielding,
and settled in Bangor, Me. They have also
lived in Connecticut and New York, and in
Charlestown, Mass., but have resided in Som-
erville for the past twenty-five years.

Mrs. Fielding, on her mother's side, descended



from the Jaquiths of Billerica, the hoase in
which her grandmother was born and married
having been usetl as a garri.son house.

Two of the family united with the old church
in Charlestown, in 1649.

Mrs. Fielding is a member of the Prospect
Hill Congregational Church, and is deeply in-
terested in all its work. She is deaconess
of the church, has been a teacher in its Sunilay-
school during the past eleven years, and is an
active worker in the home missionary depart-
ment, of which she has charge. She is also
vice-president of the Woman's Auxiliary, anil
conducts monthly meetings, which have been
atldressed by prominent speakers. The various
charities and missions connected with the local
church have been aidetl by her efforts, and she
has contributed to the educational and other
cnter])rises of the denomination at large, in
all of which she takes a special interest.

When the Associated Charities of Somerville
began its beneficent work, Mrs. Fielding ac-
cejjted an invitation to serve as agent for Ward
Two, and for nearly four years devoted her
time and energy to its tluties without compen-
sation. With heartfelt sympathy for the un-
fortunate, anil with excellent judgment and
ability, she contlucted the work in a zealous
manner; and regrets were expressed when she
felt obliged to decline a reappointment.

In 1878 a Relief Corjjs was organized in Som-
erville by Willard C. Kinsley Post, No. 139,
G. A. R., and Mrs. Fiekling was chosen secre-
tary, serving until the corps was reorganized,
three years later, as one of the corps of the
Department of Massachusetts, W. R. C, when
she was elected to the office of treasurer. She
has continued her membershi]5, and is inter-
ested in all Grand Army work, having inher-
ited a patriotic spirit from her father, who
joined the Andrew Sharp-shooters in August,
1861. She was a member of the Committee on
Information during National Convention week
in Boston in 1890, and is a member of the
Press Committee for the National Convention
in Boston in 1904.

Mrs. Fielding's husband, who is a member
and past officer of Willard C. Kinsley Post, No.
139, G. A. R., enlisted in Company A, Forty-
fourth Massachusetts Regiment, connnanded by

Colonel Francis L. Lee, and was in continuous
active service in the campaigns in North Caro-
lina under General Foster and General Burn-
side in 1862 and 1S63.

Mr. and Mrs. Fielding reside on Berkeley
Street, near Spring Hill, Somerville. They have
no children.



ELEANOR LOUISE SWAIN was
born in Blackburn, Lancashire, F&gt;ng-
lantl, November 6, lcS68, came to
America at the age of five years,
anil is a decitled New Englander in her tastes
and manners. She is the daughter of John
and Sarah (Plunkett) Conway. Her father
was a soldier in the English army. Her child-
hood and youth were passetl in Lawrence, Mass.,
and she received her education in that city. On
December 24, 1S90, she married Eugene Henry
Swain, of Waltham, Mass., residing at Martin
Square. They have two children: Grace
Abbott, born February 11, 1892; and Eugene
Conway, born January 19, 1895. In the
Deborah Rebecca Lodge, I. 0. 0. F., of Wal-
tham, she has filled the following offices —
Warden, Vice-Grand, Noble Grand, Past
Noble Grand, Chaplain, and Special Deputy
of the Grand Master of the State. She is
a member of the Wf)man's Club and the Em-
erson Browning Club and an active worker
in the L'niversalist church. Mrs. Swain en-
tered the Emerson School of Oratory in 1898,
and was graduated with high honors in 1901.
She then took a post-graduate course, winning
class honors, and is now a teacher of elocution,
oratory, and physical culture in Waltham,
conducting large classes also in Boston.

Mr. C. W. Emerson, ])roprietor of the Em-
erson College of Oratory, says of Mrs. Swain:
".vShe has accomplished much during her
three years' course, and has proved herself
to be a student of unusual power. Possessing
a mind responsive to high ideals, she has
been an inspiration both to her teachers and
her classmates. I have great confidence in
her teaching, and extend to her our cordial
recommendation. ' '

Besides having a fine presence, Mrs. Swain
is gifted with much personal magnetism,



which is no doubt one of the reasons why
the meets with such marked success in both
jniblic work and teaching. Mrs. Swain and
her husband rank among the active, influ-
ential citizens of \\'altham, Mr. Swain being
the proprietor of the Waltham Horological
School.



EUNICE DRAPER-KINNEY, M.D., who
has attained a gratifying success in her
]3rofession and in educational work, was
born in Southampton, York County,
N.B., daughterof James and Catherine (Schriver)
Draper.

She is a great-grand-daughter of Isaac Draper,
an Englishman who settled in Ireland in the
first half of the eighteenth century, and en-
gaged there in manufacturing industries. He
was for a time very successful, owning several
linen factories and over fifty houses, but was
completely ruined by the invention of the
spinning-jenny in 1767.

His son, James Draper, Sr., born May 22,
1781, was married October 22, 1814, in the
cathedral chui-ch of St. Finbarr, in the liberties
of the city of Cork, and according to the rites
and ceremonies of the Church of England and
Ireland, to Eliza Homan, who came, it is said,
of a long paternal ancestry dating from the time
of William the Conqueror. The Homans in
general were a tall and spare race, the Norman
blood evidently predominating, while the Smiths
(her maternal ancestors) were large and heavy,
most of the men being six feet or more in height.

James Draper, Sr., after losing all his prop-
erty owing to the rapid change in industrial
conditions, migrateil to New Brunswick. Here
for some years his wife supported the family by
keeping a ])rivate school. In course of time
they attained to more comfortable circum-
stances, though not to wealth, and resided for
many years in the country of their adoption.
James Draper, Sr., died February 9, 1866, and
his wife Eliza on February 5, 1872, when eighty-
three years old. They are buried at South-
ampton, York County, near the St. John River.

James Draper, Jr., son of James, Sr., and
Eliza Draper, an&lt;l father of Dr. Kinney, learned
the baker's trade, wliich, however, he aban-

donecl at the age of twenty-oae to become a
pioneer farmer anil lumberman. He was pos-
sessed of considerable inventive talent, and ex-
hibited at the Centennial Exposition at Phila-
delphia a vessel entirely of his own construc-
tion. The house in which he died, at Brooke
Station, Stafford County, Va., October 2S, 1877,
is said to have been the one in which Mrs.
E. D. N. Southworth wrote ''The Hidden
Hand." He was buried at Fredericksburg, Va.

His wife, Catherine Schriver, to whom he
was married Novemi)er i;^, 1S51, was partly of
Dutch ancestry, her paternal grandparents
coming to America from Amsterdam, Holland.
In this immigration four l)r()thers were con-
cerned, two of whom — Tobaldo, or Baltus, as
he was sometimes called (Dr. Kinney's great-
grandfather), and Nathaniel — fought as loyal-
ists for England's cause in the Revolutionary
\\'ar. In one battle or skirmish of that war
Tobaldo Schriver nai'rowly escaped death, a
bullet hitting a button of his coat over the
breast. After the war Nathaniel returned to
Amsterdam. Tobaldo and his son Abraham
became pioneer farmers in New Brunswick,
having been assigned a large tract of forest land
as the reward of their loyalty. Of the other
two brothers, both of whom espoused the cause
of the colonists, all trace has been lost. Cath-
erine Schriver Draper died December 13, 1S66,
and is buried at Southampton, York County,
N.B. Her mother was Eunice Hillman, a
daughter of Tristram and Angel (Lindup) Hill-
man, English immigrants in New Brunswick,
who resided at Southampton and at Canter-
bury. The grandfather, Tristram Hillman, who
was a sea captain, lived to the great age of one
hundred and six years.

Eunice Draper Kinney, the direct subject of
this sketch, was born and passed her early years
in a log cabin. Her educational opportunities
were so limited that up to attaining the age of
twenty-one she had attended school but two
years and a half. On August 31, 1S71, she
became the wife of JoJin Gartley, of Magagua-
davic, York County, N.B., who died June 16,
1874, leaving no property. In alluding to her
subsequent experiences Dr. Kinney says: "After
the death of my first husband, my first start in
life began at the time I picked a two-gallon pail



of wild strawberries, which I carried seven miles
to the railroad station and sold for one dollar.
With that sum I boarded the train for Bangor,
Me., having no idea of the cost of travelling.
When I told the conductor my destination, he
demanded more fare; but I stated that my
brother was in the employ of the road, and
when I gave his name he knew him, and allowed
me to pass to that city, where I obtained em-
ployment as a general housework servant. As
I was childless and so very young, I was ad-
vised by my employers to resume my maiden
name, which advice I followed and found de-
cidedly to my advantage in after years. I then
began to realize by comparison with others .how
very ignorant I was, and, being resolved not
to continue so, I devotetl all my spare moments
to study, until, much to my surprise, I found
my.self regarded as a woman of education. My
medical education came about through force of
circumstances, and not from any premeditation
on my part."

Coming to Boston to prepare herself. Miss
Draper entered the Boston Training School for
Nurses at the Massachusetts General Hospital,
and after pursuing the prescribed course was
graduateil June 8, 1881. For some years she
followed that profession in Boston, showing
great efficiency.

On August 6, 1884, she married the Hon.
John Mozart Kinney, a well-known citizen, who
had been three times elected to the Massachu-
setts House of Representatives and twice to the
State Senate, besides having helil other import-
ant offices, Init who lost his property through
financial reverses. Dr. Kinney had completed
her hospital service and was in college at the
time of her second marriage, but continued her
studies. This did not at first meet with the
approval of Mr. Kinney, but before his death,
which took place January 25, 1897, he learned
to appreciate her attainments, and benefit from
them. She obtained her medical degree April
16, 1890, from the College of Physicians and
Surgeons, Boston, and has been a practising
physician in Revere, Mass., during most of the
time since, ^\'hile establishing a self-support-
ing practice she engaged to some extent
in literary work. In June, 1895, she was
graduated from Tufts College Medical School,



268

which she had ontcred for a post-graihiate
course.

Dr. Kinney has attained a higli standing in
her profession; and her practice, which is in-
creasing, yields her a hheral income. She says:
"My work is very insjiiring to me. To stand
face to face witli Deatii, and witii cool deter-
mination to stand between him and his chosen
victim, and come out the victor, brings its own
reward, and does not become tiresome or mo-
notonous."

Dr. Kinney is meilical examiner for the
United Order of the Golden Cross, press cor-
respondent of the Woman's Relief Corps, a
member of the Count Rumford Historical So-
ciety and of the Mycological Club of Boston,
and also holds the offices of vice-president and
superintendent of narcotics in the Woman's
Christian Temjierance Union at Revere. She is
also a member of the New England Woman's
Press Association, Medical Examiner of the
United Order of the Golden Star, and is also
a member of three Aiunuii A.ssociations, —
Tufts College Medical Alumni Association, Col-
lege of Physicians and Surgeons Alumni Asso-
ciation, and that of the Massachu.setts General
Hospital Training School for Nurses. She was
formerly editor of a journal. The A'i/r&lt;e, and
was on the editorial staff of the Medical Time^i
and Register, a progressive medical publication
with influence an(l international circulation.
From her parents Dr. Kinney has derived a
punctilious regard for honor and integrity. Her
love of music and her ((uiet, firm, fearless, and
self-contained manner are a direct ancestral in-
heritance. She is a member of the Episcopal
church and an active church worker at Revere.



MARY GRAY DEANE, Past National
Insjiector of the Woman's Relief
Corps, is the wife of Major John M.
Deane, of Fall River, Mass. She
was born in Norwich, Conn., November 16,
1S46, and is a daughter of the late Abner T.
Pearce, a contractor, who built the first rail-
road in South America. During the Civil War
she was a school-girl in Providence, R.I., and
her Ieis\u'e hom'S were spent in scraping lint
and in other work for the Union soldiers. In



1865 her parents moved to Freetown, Mass.,
and a year later her marriage took place.

Mrs. Deane has been identified with relig-
ious and charitable work in Fall River for
more than thirty years, having served on ac-
tive committees of the First Congregational
Church, of which she has been a meml)er since
186.S. Dm'ing the teni[)erance revival in Fall
River several years ago Mrs. Deane was a
member of the I'^xecutive Board of the
AVoman's Christian Temperance Union, and,
as treasurer of the "Coffee House" which
was establisheil anil conducted on a large
stale by the Union, she rendered valuable aid.

She has taken an interest in the Woman's
Auxiliary to the Young Men's Christian As-
sociation, and for more than twenty years was
one of the Board of Managers of the Children's
Home at Fall River. A large brick building
was dedicated in 1895, in which many desti-
tute orphans receive the comforts of home
life. Mrs. Deane co-operated in the efforts
for the erection of this building. She is a
regular visitor to the home, and is especially
interested in the welfare of the children. She
is a meniljer of Miimehaha Lodg(% Daughters
of Rebekah, of Fall River.

For the past thirteen years she has devoted
her energies largely to work for the Grand
Army of the Rep\i!ilic. Through the efforts
of Major Deane, a Relief Corps was organized
in 1888 as an auxiliary to Richard Borden
Post, No. 46, with Mrs. Deane as a charter
member. She was chosen its President, and
was r(&gt;-elected three years in succession. Dur-
ing the nearly four years of her service as
President, Mrs. Deane met with success in
her efforts to make the corps one of the best
in the State. Upon retiring from the chair
she accepted the office of Treasurer, a position
she has held continuously, with the exception
of one year when other official duties pre-
vented. She was a member of the Executive
Committee of Arrangements for the National
(■Convention held in Boston in 1890, and has
participated in nearly all the subsequent Na-
tional Conventions.

In 1891 she was Department Inspector of
Massachusetts, and at the annual convention
the following year was elected Department



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

President. She immediately sought to famil-
iarize, herself with all the numerous detads
of the office, and, possessing unusual execu-
tive ability, conducted a very able adminis-
tration.

In her address presented at its close she said
in part: "My entire time has been given to
the service, and I have endeavored to per-
form the varied and responsd)le duties in a just
and conscientious manner. In my first gen-
eral order, issuetl February 12, the assignment
of my office hours at headquarters in Boston
was announced; but two afternoons each week
have not been sufficient to complete the
duties given to my charge. Members and com-
mittees seeking advice and information, re-
ports to be examined, correspondence requir-
ing immediate attention, copy to be furnished
the printer, and other tluties have required
my presence many days at headquarters.
Whether in Boston or at my home in Fall
River, every day has been fully occupied with
the work of the Department; and with few ex-
ceptions my evenings have been devoted to
its executive or public duties.

"I have issued nine general orders, thirty-
eight special orders, three circular letters anti
other official documents, and have written
several thousand letters. I have accepted all
invitations to represent our order at gather-
ings held by posts or corps, wherever possi-
ble. By special request I have personally
instituted four corjis — namely, at Bourne,
Williamstown, Marshtield Hills, and Weymouth;
have assisted at the institution of corps at
New Bedford, Lee, Warehani, Ijeicester, and
Boston; and it has been my pleasant duty to
install the officers of nine corps. By invitation
of the president of the New England Chau-
tauqua Assembly I presented a brief history
of our order at the Grand Army Day exercises
held at South Framinghani July 25, under the
auspices of the Assembly."

The following resolution offered by Mrs.
Deane was adopted by the convention: "That
a plan be inaugurated for the establishing of
a home in Massachusetts for the destitute
widows and orphans of ovir veterans and for
dependent army nurses on oiu" roll. That the
home be dedicated as a memorial of the pa-



triotism of the women of Massachusetts iluring
the Civil War and under the management ol
the Department of Massachusetts, \\'oman's
Relief Corps."

Being appointed chairman of a connnittee
to obtain a fund for this purpose, Mrs. Deane
issued an appeal for contributions. In re-
sponse to tiie appeal considerable sums were
received by the committee, but it was deemed
axlvisable to render immediate relief to those
in need rather than to wait for the erection
of a building. They have therefore been cared
for in their own homes and received continu-
ous aid, with friendly visits and encourage-
ment.

Mrs. Deane's portrait hangs upon the walls
of Department headquarters, placed there
by the contributions of the corps presidents
of 1892. A large and haniLsomely bound
album was presented tier at the same time,
which containetl the letters expressing the
regard of the tlonors. E. R. Hopkins Corps,
No. 155, of Williamstown, has placed her
picture in its Grand Army Hall.

Mrs. Deane was appointed Department Coun-
sellor in 1893 by her successor in office, Mrs.
Emily L. Clarke, and has continuetl her active
interest in the work. She is again serving
Corps 106, of Fall River, as treasurer, and as
chairman of its (executive committee has added
many hundreds of dollars to the corps funds
by her able management of entertainments.
She was elected chairman of the National
Executive Board in 1897 and appointetl Na-
tional Inspector of the ^^'oman's Relief Corps
in 1898. At the Department Convention in
Boston in January, 1899, she was unanimously
endorsed as a candidate for the office of Na-
tional President, and a circular was issued
in her behalf, with official endorsements from
the Department of Massachusetts, Grand Army
of the Republic, the Sons of Veterans and
Daughters of Veterans of Massachusetts.

At the National Convention in Chicago the
following September her name was presented
for the office by Mrs. Mary L. Oilman, De-
partment President, who made an earnest
speech in her behalf, testifying to her quali-
fications for leadership and the "self-sacrifice
in the noble cause." The entire delegation

from Massachusetts rose in their pkices, to
second in a body the nomination of Mrs. Deane.
She had also many pledges from other States.
Her withdrawal in favor of the candidate rep-
resenting Colorado and Wyoming was a great
disappointment to her many friends.

Mrs. Deane is a mendjer of the Ladies' Aid
Association of the Soldiers' Home in Massa-
chusetts, also of Quequechan Chapter, Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution.

Her husband, wiio is in hearty sympathy
with her work, was Major of the Twenty-
ninth Massachusetts Regiment, and has re-
ceived a Congressional medal of honor for
special bravery on the field. He was in many
of the campaigns of the Army of the Potomac.
Major Deane was appointed Assistant National
Inspector of the G. A. R. by Commander-in-
chief Lawler, and, after filling several offices
in the Department of Massachusetts, G. A. R.,
was elected Department Commander in 1897.

After leaving the army Major Deane fol-
lowed the profession of teacher, but for sev-
eral years past has been a successful merchant
in Fall River. Major and Mrs. Deane enter-
tain many friends in their beautiful home in
Assonet, a suburb of Fall River. They have
four sons and one daughter.



FLORENCE GERTRUDE WEBER.-
Florence Gertrude, the only child of
Charles and Henrietta (Ingram) Bick-
ford, was born in Boston, April 8, 1870.
She was married to Emile J. Weber, by the
Rev. E. Winchester Donald, September 22,
1897. Mrs. Weber's education was obtained
at the Winthroj) Grammar School and the
Girls' Latin School, where she was graduated
in 1889. Then some years were passed in the
study of art — modelling, drawing, and water-
color sketching — and two years were devoted
to the historj'^ of European countries. During
this season of study she became deeply im-
pressed with the development in the Middle
Ages of the feminine arts of embroidery, weav-
ing, and lace-making. By inheritance the art
of the needle was hers. Curiously, the task of
reconstruction always possess(&gt;(l for her great
charm. In the mending of formidable lent in



any textile, the finer the stuff and the larger
the hole, the more absorbing was the occupa-
tion. A gift of insight into the construction
of things was also coupletl with technical skill,
and thus, when she mended a fabric, she came
to understand readily how it had been woven.
One day, while she was mending for an ac-
quaintance a point lace collar which had met
with an accident, there came to her this thought :
"If any woman can make that lace, I must be
able to do so also." Fine laces had always been
dear to her heart, and she possessed a few
simple pieces of ^'alenciennes, English thread,
and Honiton.

Like all well-onleretl Boston girls, she went
first for information to the Public Library.
There were many volumes on the history of
lace, and a few about how to make it, most of
the latter being in German, French, Italian, or
Russian. Here the Latin School training, in
going to the root of matters, came in, as well
as the instruction in French. German had
been learned outside of the school, so she read
all the German and the French books. Then,
as some Italian books contained interesting
illustrations, she set herself to work to study
Italian, so that she could translate these also.
In the meantime she began to produce bits of
\&gt;netian ])oint lace, but the lack of proper
thread was a gi'eat obstacle. Securing some
little balls of the finest to be hail here, she cut out
a few inches at a time where it ran fine, and re-
jected the rest; but even this was not suitable
for fine mesh, which is the joiid of Brussels
point.

At this stage of her progress, pillow lace
making began to invite her attention. No
materials were at hand. Torchon lace was not
what she .sought' it was the "piece lace," such
as Honiton and Duchesse, and here she came
to a halt. Not a book in the library offered
any technical information. At the Arts and
Crafts Exhibition in Copley Hall in 1899 was
a case containing laces made by an Italian
woman, whose address was gi\-en in the cata-
logue. While the lace was of the torchon
\'ariety, Mrs. Weber felt that at least she could
ac(|uire the use of the bol^bins, and the next
day took her first le.':.«on. The little Italian
woman spoke no I]nglish, and Mrs. Weber's



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



271



Italian at that time was not of tiie oonversa-
tional kind. The whole of the following day
was spent struggling o\n- that narrow ])attern
of torchon.

" It was quite the most hopeless thing I ever
attemptetl," she says. "I could see, however,
how it should be done, although I could not do
it myself. At night my s])irits were at a low
ebb, and I ached physically and mentally. The
next morning, when I went to work again, the
difficulties vanished, and I made several inches
without a flaw. I took another lesson and
learned a new pattern. I showed my teacher
a l)it of Duchesse lace, and to my amazement
she failed to even recognize it as jiillow lace.
With my third lesson I found that I could see
' how to make every pattern my Italian lady
had; and there were some fifty different laces,
frf)ni half an inch to eight inches in width. I
went home and proceeded to cut up some
Duchesse lace under a microscope. I cut bliss-
fully away, as the days went by, until I had
sacrificed several dollars' worth, and had found
out all but one thing — how to fasten the leaves
together. Although they were not sewed, they
were firmly joined; and still they were made
in order, one at a time. For a long time the
way was hidden.

"Next I turned my attention to strip laces —
Mechlin, Valenciennes, and English thread.
Here, more than ever, I felt the lack of proper
material. I hatl to resort to ravelling out the
finest handkerchief linen and using the threads
to acquire the technicpie of Mechlin and \'alen-
ciennes. I made the lives of the shopkeepers
miserable trying to get fine lace thread. Fi-
nally one shopman asked his buyer to get me
some, and I paid him eight dollars for what
now costs me sixty cents. With this fine thread
I succeeded m producing all kinds of fine laces
by copying those I owned and others that were
very kindly lent to me. I set about finding
out where in Europe I could send for materials,
and soon began to import all kinds of fine
threads, bobbins, and pins."

One day, while Mrs. Welier was lof)king over
an old I'lnglish book on lace, she came across
a list of tools for lace-making. " Among them,"
she says, "was a tinj' hook, described as 'useful
in drawing the threads through when joining



the leaves.' Here was the clew to the mystery
which for three years I had been unable to solve
— how the leaves and scrolls were fastened to-
gether without being sewed."

About this time there were shown to Mrs.
AVeber laces that had been left in an estate, to
be sold by the executors. Among them was a
great square of A'enctian point lace and a
Duchesse lace skirt — a flounce four yards long
and a yaril and an eighth deep, with twenty-
four point lace medallions set into the pattern.
These two large pieces of lace, too old-fashioned
in shape to use, too modern to be of interest
to collectors, were a problem to the trustees
of the estate. She suggested that the lace was
made of sniall i)ieces, and could be remade into
small articles, making it salable. She was
asked to figure the number of articles possible,
the value when completed, and the cost of
making them, and, having done this, was given
the chance to do as she had suggested, with
])leasing results to all concerned. This brought
her curious bits of mending from those who
bought the laces. All kinds of lace work came
to her, and she began to collect lace, aiming
to make a representative collection of laces
made at the present day.

The Arts and Crafts Society attracted her.
She knew that among its members were those
who had struggled with technical difficulties
in various crafts. She applietl for membership,
was received most pleasantly, listened to with
interest, and at length w'as asked if it were
possible to establish a lace industry here. Miss
Anne Withington, the head of the W^omen's
Residence of the South End Settlement, had
become imbued with the idea of establishing
some industries for girls and women, to be co-
operative in plan and to give employment to
girls of fine taste and ability, wdio would in
this way be saved from hopeless drudgery in
factories and shops. The industries were to
be a refining influenc(&gt; in the neighborhood, and
lace was to be one of them. She applied to the
Arts and Crafts Society for a lace-maker the
same week that Mrs. Weber joined the society.

After much advice from persons already
versed in industrial work, also after several
generous givers had furnished the money, with
the Arts and Crafts Society to influence it, Mrs.

Weber to introihicc it, and the Women's Resi-
dence of the South Knd to house it, the first
■lace industry in this country was hegun I&lt;&gt;1)-
ruary 18, 1901, with one pupil. Miss ICli/.ahetli
Feely. Her progress was watched with inter-
est, and in the first week was begun a simple,
narrow insertion of English thread lace, that
was salable at sixty cents a yard. Other girls
came, but either they were not adapted or cir-
cimistances took them away. In six weeks,
however, another lace-maker had conie to stay,
Miss Alice Riorden; and the.se two girls for
many months carried on ''the induahy." Their
progess was encouraging. They began at once
with the very fine thread, and learned first tf)
make the beautiful lace known as the P^nglish
thread. Then they were taught to make sep-
arate figures and to ornament them with deli-
cate fillings peculiar to old Honiton. Small
things were turned out — at first, tie ends,
doilies, little collars. Then orders came for
more pretentious articles. The girls learned
to clean laces in the I'AU'opean manner. Rare
things came to Mrs. Weber to be restored, from
Portsmouth, N.H., Fitchhurg, from St. T&gt;ouis
even. New girls joined the industry, and it
began to pay its own way. Since the first six
months of its existence there has not been a
day when there were not orders ahead to be
filled. At present six lace-makers are busy all
the time, and several outside the shops lU'e
filling orders for special varieties that can be
made at home.

So nuich has been accomplished by one New
England woman in the face of great difficulties.
American girls, absolutely untrained, have in
one year been taught to make the finest laces,
equal, it is claimed, to any produced in the
world at the present day by workers whose
families have been lace-makers for generations.



HELEN COFFIN BEEDY was born
in Harrington, Washington County,
Me., November 9, 1840, the daugh-
ter of John B. and Ruby fStrout)
Coffin. Her maternal grandparents, Benja-
min and Joanna (Roberts) Strout, were
pioneer settlers of Harrington. Benjamin
Strout was a man greatly respected for his



sterling integrity. He traced his descent
from a long line of English ancestors. His
wife Joanna, a native of Portland, Me., was
a famous housekeeper. Her receipts and her
instructions, her chiklren say, have never
been improved upon by the inventions of
modern domestic science. She was also nuich
given to works of charity.

Mrs. Beedy's father, John B. Coffin, by
occupation a ship-builder, was one of the
leading citiz(&gt;ns of Harrington in his day.
He u.sed to .solemnize marriage, and he often
representetl the town in the State Legis-
lature. In politics he was a Democrat. Both
Mr. and Mrs. Coffin were members of the
Baptist church. Many of his ancestors and
their kindred were Quakers or Friends, and
Mrs. Beedy is proud to be allied to Lucretia
Mott and the Rev. Phciebe Hanaford. The
Coffin lineage in America extends back to Tris-
tram Coffin, who came to New England in 1642,
and diwl in Nantucket in 1681.

Mrs. Beedy's mother. Ruby Strout Coffin,
was from early girlhood highly religious.
Her diary gives a record of her many interest-
ing experiences as a teacher, which ])rofe.ssion
she adojited at the early age of .seventeen.
She describes her long journeys on horseback
through the woods to her school. After
her marriage Mrs. Coffin became the first
president of the Martha Washington Society
at Harrington, and in one of her addresses,
the paper of which is now j'ellowed with
time, we find she advocated the founding
of a village library — advocated it so pertinently
that it was soon in operation, being hou.sed
for .some years in the homes of the members,
who alternately assumed the obligation.

Mrs. Beedy's early training was of the best.
Her mother's i-eligious teaching took deep
root in her heart, and her father's coun.sels
were for her practical good. He frecpiently
.Slid: "Helen, you have neither beauty nor
wealth. If you accomplish anything in the
world, you nmst work for it." And work
she did. By her grandmother Strout, with
whom she went to live at the age of nine,
after her mother's death, she was taught
skilled hou.sek(&gt;(&gt;ping. Being a vigorous child,
she kept constantly at school in her native

town, later uttending the academy at Cherry-
field, Me., as well as that at East Machias.
In 1863 she was graduated from the Bridge-
water Normal School, anil afterward she
studied French, German, and painting under
private instructors. She was a mendx-r of
Professor Agassiz's school at Penikese during
the two years of its existence. She subsequently
took the full Chautauqua course, ami at llad-
cliffe College in the year 1897 she took a special
course in English composition. She is still
a student, and, except when the press of duties
forbids, is never long away from her books.

In the Farmington State Normal School
she is rememberetl as a conscientious and
enthusiastic instructor, one whose personal
interest in her pupils extended beyond the
walls of the class-room.

The marriage of Miss Helen Coffin and Mr.
Daniel Beedy took place in 1875 at Castine,
Me. For a number of years Mr. Beedy was
one of the more jirominent citizens of Farm-
ington, where they made their home, and
where since Mr. Beedy's death, in 1889, Mrs.
Beedy, when not travelling abroad, has con-
tinued to reside.

Mrs. Beedy lias been president of the Frank-
lin County W. C'. T. U. ever since its organ-
ization. She is an active member of the
Methoilist I'^piscopal chui'ch, has been officially
connected with the State Suffrage Clul) and
the State Federation of Clubs, and has served
as president of the National Dorothea Dix
Memorial Association since its inauguration
in 1899. But her duties as president are
but a small part of her work along this line.
She has written, spoken, and travelled, ai'-
ranged fairs, interested ])eople to contribute,
and has appeared in Congress to plead sjiecially
for an appropriation toward erecting a monu-
ment to the memory of Miss Dix.

A comprehensive volume, entitled "Mothers
of Maine," bears Mrs. Beedy's name upon
the title-page. The compilation of facts was
a long but delightful task to her, and so well
did she succeed in her work that this history
of remarkable Maine women covers a period
of more than two centuries.

Thus author, educator, lecturer, phihinthro-
pist, may all be written after Mrs. I^eedy's



name. And t(j such as know her there will
come to mind unwritten achievements of
daily life which stand for true courage and
integrity.

Note. — As this article was about to go to press, we
received the news of Mrs. Beedy's death, which oc-
curred June 14, 1904.



MARY (T.ARA WARE KIRBY.— The
\\'are family, to which Mrs. Kirby
ijelongs, has been represented in
Massachusetts nearly two hundred
and fifty years. Its founder in this coun-
try Was Robert \\'are, who came from Devon,
England, in 1664. He was given a grant of
land in Dedham, and two years later was
made "freeman." A man of imi)t)rtance in the
connnunity, the second largest tax-payer in
the town, and a member of the artillery com-
pany, he was a good neighbor, a kind husband
and father. He died in 1698. His will, drawn
tlie year previous, shows more than usual jus-
tice and thoughtfulness toward the wife he was
leaving to the care of his children. The
breadth of vision and mental strength of this
their first American ancestor .seem to have been
transmitted in large degree to his ilescendants.
In 1775 Joseph ^^'are, a great-grandson of
the innnigrant, was one of the soldiers hi Ar-
nokl's famous expedition against Quebec, and
won promotion for his bravery. His Journal
of the Expedition (published in 1884 by Joseph
Ware, of Needham, a great-grandson) is
historically valuable, containing among other
data a complete list of the Americans killed,
wounded, and taken prisoners on the fateful
day of December 31, 1775.

l^nitarian for generations in their religious
preferences, the Wares have numbered in their
ranks many distinguished clergymen and
scholars. Ralph A\'are, a great-grandson of
the Revolutionary hero and the father of the
subject of this .sketch, was of the liberal school
of thought, and when he married Mary Jordan,
the daughter of an English rniversalist clergy-
man, it is small woiuler that in their home all
matters of advanced thought and scientific
research should have been given im]nirtial con-
sideration.

There were nine chiklren, seven living to
attain their majority, yet the mother could
always find time to help a neighbor or friend
in illness or distress, and her house was at all
times a place of refuge for the troubled and
weary. She finished her work here, as her
well-rounded life, patterned after that of Him
who "went about doing good," came to an
earthly close late in the year of 1893; but
its influence can never be calculated, nor will
it ever cease to be.

Of such parentage was born Mary Clara
Ware in Dorchester, Mass. As the eldest of
four sisters, she was always ready to give
assistance to the younger, and at school the
unfortunate found in her a friend quick to
sympathize, with a judgment far beyond her
years. The timid little ones sought lier hand
for protection, the slow ones brought the prob-
lems they could not solve, and the friend-
less looked toward her, sure of a smile. So
even and true was she, and still is, that some
one who has known Mrs. Kirby all her life said
recently: "Oh, well! It is no effort for her
to be afTable and kind. She never seemed to
want to be any other way." But, since no
life is free from its trials, and as every heart
knoweth its own bitterness, some credit is
surely due this woman who never seemed to
want to be anything but agreeable.

The spirit of humauitarianism grew with her
growth, fostered by the home training, and
kept with her when she entered more actively
into the joys antl cares of life. Ambition
ruled strongly, and the pride of self-respect
prompted her to do everything well. Possessed
of more than ordinary business ability, she
has used that masculine quality most success-
fully, planning with the "brain of a man and
the intuition of a woman." From the gratifi-
cation of self in the enjoyments of social life,
which claimed her attention, she grailually
turned to the higher pleasure of giving her time
and energies for the good of others.

With a thirst for wisdom, desirous of learning
the reason of things and finding a more excel-
lent way of life, she has devoted nmch time
and thought to psychic and mystic studies, anil
through such research .she feels confident that
she has come nearer to the needs of human



beings. Her eyes have been opened to see God's
children as they are, and yet to feel that it is
possil)le for them to become in truth His image
and likeness. It has taught her to see tiie
"good in everything save sin" and to love the
sinner while condemning and rebuking the
transgression. The pure and literal interpre-
tation of the Christ principle has become her
simple but comprehensive creed, and the com-
mandment, "Bear ye one another's burdens,"
a daily precept.

On August 2, 1886, she was married to
Daniel Henry Kirby, of Boston. Mr. Kirby,
until his death (May 4, 1901) was a reatly sym-
pathizer and a helper in all her work for others.
His only solicitude was lest enthusiasm should
be in excess of bodily endurance, the willing
spirit make too serious demand upon the flesh,
and cut .short a life useful to others and dear to
him.

In the fall of 1894, on her return home, after
a summer, spent rather idly for her, in the coun-
try, where the daily changes were an object
lesson of God in nature and a continual proof
of a divine hand that brought in turn seed-
time and harvest, Mrs. Kirby with others
helped to organize and form the Procojieia
Club. As is the meaning of the name, the object
of the club was to provide for the needy of all
classes and conditions just the mental, moral,
physical, and spiritual help each might need
— a tremendous undertaking, and not en-
tered into lightly nor with any sjMrit of rivalry
toward the already established charities, either
]iul)lic or private, but to reach by the personal
aid of a loving haml and ilevoted attention
those who were repelled by the idea of alms-
taking.

The society's rooms were on St. Botolph
Street, Boston, and there every day in the week
from eleven .\.m. until three p.m. Mrs. Kirby
might be found, giving a willing ear and thought-
ful attention to all sorts of people asking all
sorts of aid. All this time and thought were
given freely on her part, but with what
a cost to her .sympathies and nerve tissue, to
say nothing of the whole body physical! None
were ever turned away unhelped, though many
were not given exactly what they asked for;
for the plan of the society was to study the

individual imd prescribe for his need rather
than to his wants. Many a poor creature, dis-
couraged and heart-sick, as well as miserably
poor of this world's goods, could testify to the
ministration to both bodily and spiritual needs;
and scores in want of employment or perhaps
unfitted to their present employment could tell
of a changed burden, that from its lightness
and because it better fitted their shoulders
seemed no burden at all. To bring the mind
of man in accord with Gad's great plans for the
human race, and thus bring the universe in
concord with the Creator, is the tremendous
aim of those who planned the Procopeia Club.

In 1895 "Mrs. Helen \an Anderson, seeking
to establish a new and unsectarian church,
afterwanl named by Professor Trine the Church
of the Higher Life, came to Mrs. Kirby for the
executive aid she felt that lady was capable
of giving. It was incorporated the same
year, with Mrs. Kirby as its president. Later
a service was held in Allen Hall, ordaining
and installing with impressive ceremony Mrs.
Van Anderson as its minist(&gt;r, among the clergy-
men to officiate being the Rev. Minot J. Savage,
the Rev. Antoinette Blackwell, and others of
note.

With all this puljlic work Mrs. Kirby still
founil time to attend to 'social duties, to
be at home to her friends, antl to put her
thoughts on paper in the form of essays and
poems. These, published as the result of her
experiences in philanthropic work, brought to
her a huge correspondence in the shape of
questions and requests for spiritual aid, and
entailetl an impossible amount of writing. This
also provetl even more conclusively, if that weie
necessary, that a great number of people were
reaching out for a strength and hope they
longed for, but did not know how to obtain.
Under each question, beneath every inquiry,
was the spirit of unrest — a lack of conununion
and understanding of God's plans for his creat-
ures. How was that cry to be answered, and
those needs, how were they to be met ?

The Faith and Hope Fund, planned by Mrs.
Kirby, was a step in the right (lirection. It ac-
complished enough to lead to tlie present
Faith and Hope Association, formed in Sep-
tember, 1896, and incorporated in October of



the same year. The present home of the asso-
ciation is at the new Boylston Chambers,
Boylston Street, Boston. Mrs. Kirby is its
president, assisted by a board of directors.

Perhaps no better idea of the work can be
given than in the words of the president her-
self, dedicated to the association and i.ssued
Christmas, 1901:—

" Love thouglits on angels' wings do fly
Forever through the azure sky.
With Faith they touch the hearts of all,
While Hope awakens at their call.

" Love will redeem and set aside
All prejudice, thus open wide
The door of sunshine and of peace,
To bid unrest forever cease.

" For Ixjve, which is Life's golden key,
Heljis to unlock all mystery ;
While Truth will ever point the way,
If Love we have as guest alway.

" Faith, Hope, and Love will guide us on,
Until the victory we have won.
Discouraged thoughts we'll bid away,
That happier ones may come to stay.

" So let us all in love unite
Through harmony, with music bright.
We'll lift the souls now sick and sad.
And manv wearv hearts make glad."



The motto of the .society is, " Love conquers
the world," ami the organizers of the Faith and
Hope Association are putting heart and soul
into the work of such branches as have alreaily
been established. They do not "beg" for their
charities, but state the case, and feel confident
that the case will recommend itself.

Sin antl want are the foes they propose to
fight and comiuer — sin of any kind, and want
in whatever 'nature it manifests itself. It is
often want of proper knowledge that plunges
the soul over its first moral precipice. Igno-
rance of the laws of nature is sin to the third
and fourth generation.

Like the Procopeia Club, the Faith and Hope
Association enileavors to fit the needy to the
neeil. The rooms of tlie as.sociation at Christ-
mas time resemble nothing so much as the
home of a Santa Clans determined to give



276



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



every one some useful ami desirable present;
and, though the number reaches up into the
lunidreds, more could and would be given, were
there more to give. Besides this, hospitals,
prisons, antl reformatory institutions are re-
membered with boxes, and on holidays bands of
singers and entertainers are sent to bring behinil
the gates of these places a share of the joy that
pervades the outside world. At the Easter sea-
son, also, the message of the resurrection, borne
by beautiful flowers, is carried into hospitals and
homes.

The association, knowing that the affairs
of city and State will -some day be in the hands
of the lioys now being brought up, and some
of them under wrong influences, are going out
into the highways and hetlges to find the neg-
lected and those under vicious and unhealthy
moral conditions, and are trying by means of
pleasant allurements of boyish sports and
healthy games to secure their attention and win
them to ways of virtue.

A floiwisliing sewing society is maintained in
connection with the association, and hundreds
of warm garments are made each year antl dis-
tributed. Homes have been found in institu-
tions foi' those having moral or ])hysical neetls,
and judicious loans have been matle to meet
pressing demands. All this work, however, has
been made subservient to spiritual needs, and
the chief aim has been to show that a right use
of spiritual gifts will !)reclude much of the
physical suffering of the world. All the ofh-
cers of the association, it may here be said, are
working for the love of doing good, there being
no salaries.

No pen portrait of Mrs. Kirby could convey
to those unacquainted with her any idea of
the personality that wins and keeps her many
friends.

The Spanish have a maxim that he who eats
fruit, and does not plant the seed, is ungrate-
ful to the generation before him, and deals
unjustly toward those who follow. In the
great garden of God's world some sow, never
expecting to reai): and, judged by the standard
of the Spanish maxim, a sower like Mrs. Kirljy
is fulfilling her duty to both the generation
before and to those who follow her.

MABEL LOOMIS TODD, author and
lecturer, the wife of Professor David
P. TocUl, of Amherst College, was
born in Cambridge, Mass., the only
child of Eben Jenks and Mary Alden (Wilder)
Loomis.

Her first American ancestor on her father's
side was Joseph' Loomis, who came from Brain-
tree, Englantl, in 1638, and settled at Windsor,
Conn., in 1640. The sixth ancestor in that
line was her father's grandfather, the Rev.
Josiah" Loomis, of Stafford, Coim., and Ashfield,
Mass.

Her maternal grandparents were the Rev.
.John Wilder, Jr.,' and his wife, Mary Wales
Folies Jones. The Rev. John Wilder, Sr.,"
(Dartmouth College, 1784), her great-grand-
father, was for many years minister of the Con-
gregational church in Attleboro, Mass. His
wife, Esther Tyler, was daughter of Colonel
Sanmel Tyler, of Preston, Conn., a Revolution-
ary officer of note. The Wilder line is traced
back through Jonas,^^ John,^^ to Thomas'
Wilder, who became a member of the church in
Charlestown, Mass., in 1640, and some years
later removed to Lancaster, Mass. (See book
of the Wilders.)

The Rev. John Wilder, Jr.' (Brown L'ni.'er-
sity, 182.3), was settled in 1833 as pastor of the
Trinitarian Congregational Church in Concord,
Mass., where he remained six years. Three
fine elms still standing in front of the old par-
sonage in Concord were pl.anted by him, one
for each of his three children. He died in 1844.
His wife, Mary, the mother of Mrs. Loomis
and grandmother of Mi's. Todd, was a daugh-
ter of Nehemiah and Polly (Alden) Jones, of
Raynham, Mass.

Through the last named ancestor Mrs. Todd
is a tlescendant in the ninth generation of John
Alden, who as proxy for Myles Standish wooed
Priscilla Mullins, "the Mayflower of Plymouth"
in the poet's talk, and won her for himself.
The line from John and Priscilla continued
through their son Joseph,^ who married Mary
Simmons; John,' married Hannah White; Jo-
seph,^ married Hannah Hall; Ebenezer,'^ mar-
ried Ruth Fobes; Polly (or Mary)," married Ne-
hemiah Jones; Mary Wales Fobes,' married the
Rev. John \\'ilder, Jr.; Mary Alden AVilder,"

married Eben Jenks Looini.s; to their daughter,
Mabel" Loomis Todtl.

Eben Jenks Loomis was ecUicated in the
Lawrence Scientific School, Harvard Univer-
sity. When a young man, he entered upon the
active duties of his chosen profession, as an
astronomer in the office of the Nautical Alma-
nac at Cambridge. The office a few years later
being removed to Washmgton, D.C., he went
with it, and in the United States Naval Obser-
vatory hcUl the position of Senior Assistant,
American Ephemeris, for forty years, tendering
his resignation in 1900, after rounding out a
half-century of astronomical service. In 1889
Professor Loomis was a member of the United
States eclipse expedition to the west coast of
Africa. He is the author of a volume of " W^ay-
side Sketches," 1894; "An Eclipse Party,"
1896; and a l^ook of poems, recently published.
With Mrs. Loomis he is passing the present
winter (1903-1904) in her native town, Con-
cord, Mass. His own birthplace was Oppen-
heim, N.Y.

The education of Mabel Loomis, received
largely at the Georgetown Seminary, was sup-
plemented by two or three years' study in Bos-
ton, her special attention being given to Ger-
man* painting, and music, vocal and instru-
mental, inchuling a thorough course in har-
mony under Stephen A. Emery. After spend-
ing one winter in the gay society of Washington,
she was married March 5, 1879, to David P.
Todd, then connected with the Unitetl States
Naval Observatory in that city. Soon after-
ward Mr. Todd received a call to the chair of
astronomy in Amherst College (his Alma
Mater), being made director of its observatory
and also professor of the higlier mathematics at
Smith College.

Mrs. Todd has always taken nmch interest
in her husband's work. In 1887 and again in
1896 she accompanied him to Japan to observe
the eclipses of the sun. The second eclipse
they viewed from Yezo, the most northern
island of the empire. Here, in a little fishing
village bordering the Sea of Okhotsk, she made
a study of the Ainu, tlie barbarian aborigines
of Japan, in a region never before visited by
a foreign woman. She made a collection of
their utensils, garments, and ornaments, for the



Peabody Musemn in Salem. In the spring of
1900 she joined the Professor at Tripoli, in
Barbary, whither he had gone to observe the
sun's eclipse of May 28. Early in 1901 Profes-
sor and Mrs. Todd, this time accompanied by
their daughter, Millicent, then a stu&lt;lent at
\'assar College, sailed for Singapore, afterward
locating the Amherst College Eclipse Expedi-
tion on the island of Singkep^ in the Dutch
East Indies, where the phenomenon was ob-
sei-ved on May 18. Trips were made later to
Siam and Borneo, and several weeks were spent
in the Philippines, where with General Corbin
they made a tour of the archipelago. A visit
to China, a third visit to Japan, and a short
stay at the Hawaiian Islands completed the
circuit of the globe for this expedition. Mrs
Todd has contributed many articles to the Na-
tion, the Outlook, St. Nicholas, the Century, and
other magazines. " Footprints," her first book,
was publishetl in 1883. In 1890 she edited the
first volume of the posthumous poems of Emily
Dickinson, which met with instant success, and
in 1891 she edited a second volume. In 1894
slie edited two volumes of Miss Dickinson's
letters, and also published a volume upon "Total
Eclipses of the Sun," the only standard popular
work upon that subject. In the autumn of
1896 a third volume of Emily Dickinson's poems,
as well as "A Cycle of Sonnets" by an anony-
mcjus author, appearetl under her editorship.

In 1898 appeared, published by Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co., "Corona and Coronet," a narra-
tive of the unique yachting trip to Japan in
search of the eclipse of 1896. Her revised ver-
sion of Steele's " Fourteen Weeks in Astronomy "
was published in 1900.

" Mrs. Todd," as well remarked by one who
speaks not idly, "is a woman of many talents.
A student of art and science, she is also a viva-
cious and attractive speaker, welcome every-
where on the platform, as in society." Each
season for several years she has given more
than fifty drawing-room talks, and addresses in
halls, churches, schools, and club parlors, upon
subjects coimected with popular astronomy,
Japan in various aspects, the Ainu, the Hawai-
ian Islands, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, the
PhilipjMnes, the Alhambra, Carthage, the Ober-
ammcrgau Passion Play, Tripoli, and on other

topics, many of her lectures being profusely
illustrated with stereopticon slides. Among the
clubs ;ui(l colleges, more than ohe hundred in
number, before which she has spoken, a few
may bo mentioned, merely to show the eccen-
tricity of her comet-like wanderings: the New
England Women's Club and Appalachian, of
Boston; Century Club, San Francisco; Woman's
Club, St. Johnsbury, Vt.; Kosmos Club, Wake-
field, Mass.; New Century Club, Philadelphia;
A^'oman's Club, Waterbury, Conn. ; Rhode
Island Woman's Club, Providence; Contempo-
rary Club, Trenton, N.J.; the Fortnightly, Bath,
Me.; Va'^sar College; Amherst College; Adelbert
College (Cleveland, Ohio) ; and Bryn Mawr.
Mrs. Todd does not care for the kind of activity
involved in holding official positions of any
kind, and never accepts one without genuine
protest. She has served as one of the Massa-
chusetts Committee of the General Federation
of W^omen's Clubs, for three years as a director
in .the Massachusetts State . Federation of
Women's Clubs, and in other places of respon-
sibility in connection with club work. She is
now Regent of the Mary Mattoon Chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolution, and
President of the Amherst Historical Society.



OlAYE E. DANA has won an enviable
reputation as story-teller, essayist, antl
poet. Her first published article ap-
peared in 1S77. "Untler Friendly
Eaves" is a volume of short stories, revealing
the natural and wholesome atmosphere and
at the same time the romantic and heroic
spirit which pervade the true New England
life. This book, as one reviewer has fitly said,
"brings the reader into ]ileasant places and
among honest 'kintra' folk of the sterling
kind such as may be found in the rural dis-
tricts with which Mrs. Stowe first began to
make us familiar." Through Miss Dana's
character sketches the reader is introduced
to genuine country and village people; and, if
the crabbed, miserly old man and the melan-
choly and morbid woman occasionally appear,
they are portrayed as exceptions, not as types.
The iiifluenc(&gt; of her stories, imbu(»d as they
are with the spirit of cheery helpfulness, is



eimobling and ui)lifting. Many of her stories
are for children and young people. In ad-
dition to her rare gifts as a story-teller. Miss
Dana jiossesses the poet's instinct and power
of interjM'etation. Her publi.shed verses, among
them being such poems as "The Summons,"
" I'vXplanation," "For Light," "Shakespeare's
Day," and "It Always Comes," which di.sclose
a deep spiritual insight into nature and
humanity, have been widely copied. Miss
Dana has also contributed to the Journal of
Education, and other similar publications, ar-
ticles which, with her critical and literary es-
says and her able and discriminating V)ook
reviews, disclose a scholarly and cultured mind,
originality of thought, and the keen instinct of
the critic.

In her literary work, as well as in her per-
sonal character, Miss Dana shows her rich
New England heritage. There have been nu-
merous instances in the history of our coun-
try which prove that literary al)ility is the
])roduct. not alone of individual talent, but
also of family inheritance; and, in view of this
un(|uestione(l fact. Miss Dana comes right-
fully by her mental strength and versatility
of talent. She is a direct descendant of Rich-
ard Dana, whose name appears upon the rec-
ords of Cambridge, Mass., in 1640, and who
was the founder of a family which has con-
tributed in a marked degree to the social,
literary, and political advancement of our
country. Patriots, soldiers, preachers, edi-
tors, authors, scientists, college [iresidents and
professors, are all found in the annals of the
family bearing the old and honored name of
Dana.

The immigrant Dana was of English birth;
but it is believed that there was a strain of
French blood in his family, and this may have
given to the Danas something of the vivacity
and brilliancy which is noted in the work of
many authors who have French as well as
English blood in their veins. It is certain
that, with all those stanch and heroic qualities
which have made the Danas eminent for gen-
erations, the members of this family have also
inherited an intellectual brilliancy which has
made them a recognized power in our civic
and literary history. It is therefore but a

natural and happy result that the subject of
this sketch should have entered upon her
life work endowed with those mental qualifi-
cations by the cultivation of whicli she has
developed into a versatile and charming writer.
But she is not indebted to the Danas alone for
her inheritance.

Her great-grandfather, Phineas Dana, a
descendant of Joseph Dana, the second son
of the original Richard, settled in Oxford,
Mass. He married Mehitabel AVolcott, of that
town, daughter of Josiah^ Wolcott (Henry,'
of Windsor, Conn.) and his wife Isabella,
daughter of the Rev. John Campbell. This
eminent divine, who for forty years was be-
loved anil revered as pastor of the church at
Oxford, Mass., where many traditions of his
scholarship and godly character still remain,
was a native of Scotland and ■ a graduate of
Edinburgh University. An early ancestor of
Miss Dana's on the maternal side was Major
Thomas Savage, who came from England to
Boston in 1633, ami who was the founder of
a family distinguished by integrity, inilustry,
great determination, and unusual physical
endurance. Of this typical New England
stock was James Savage, one of the earliest
and most prominent settlers of Augusta, Me.
His wife, Eliza Bickford, of Alton, N.H., is
still remembered as a woman of devout thought
and benignant presence. Sarah W. Savage,
the daughter of James and Eliza Bickford
Savage, married James Wolcott Dana, and
became the mother of Olive E. Dana, who
was born in Augusta, December 24, 1859.

With her refined and charming personality,
her forceful and sympathetic character, and
her remarkalale mental endowments, Miss Dana
has exerted a wide infiuence in her large circle
of friends and among the many reatlers whom
she has never .seen. During the last twenty
years, while constantly contributing to the
press, Miss Dana has generously given of her
time and ability to all good works. She has
been interested and active in the church and
in the philanthropic and educational move-
ments of the day. She was one of the founders
of the Current Events Club of Augusta, and
was for two years its honored and efficient
president. She has also been a member of



Unity Club; and one of her most beautiful
poems, "The Laggard Land," was written for
a Ixinquet of this old and well-known literary
society.



HARRIET W^OOD FOSTER, second
daughter of the late David Wood
Foster, formerly a well-known and
public-spirited citizen of this city,
and his wife, Sarah E. Abbott, was born in
Boston, as were most of her ancestors for sev-
eral generations. On the paternal side she is
descended from Hopestill Foster (son of Rich-
ard Foster, of Biddenden, County Kent, Eng-
land), who arrived at Dorchester, Mass., with
his mother, Mrs. Patience Bigg Foster, in 1635.
The name of Hopestill Foster appears on the
Dorchester records of many years, he serving
as Treasurer, Selectman, Deputy to the
General Court, and commissioner for small
causes.

John Foster, one of his sons, was graduated
from Harvard College in 1667, excelling in math-
ematics. In 1675 he established the first
printing-press in Boston. He compiled an
almanac for that year, which was printed by
Samuel Green, and he was author and printer
of the Boston Almanacs for 1676-81. He also
made the seal of the colony. He died in 1681,
and his gravestone, bearing a curious device,
can still be seen in the old cemetery at Up-
ham's Corner, Dorchester. He left no chil-
dren.

Miss Foster's paternal grandfather, John
Hancock Foster, son of Hopestill Foster of the
fourth generation (Hopestill,^ James^) and his
wife Susan, daughter of David Wood, was
born in a house that formerly stood at the
south-east corner of Hollis and Washington
Streets, Boston, which he afterward inherited.
In this house, in 1814, he was married to Miss
Elizabeth Allen, of Boston, and within its walls
both he and his wife died. The property was
]xn'chased from Governor Belcher over two
hundred years ago, and is still in the posses-
sion of John Hancock Foster's heirs. In this
house was held the first meeting relative to
the formation of the Hollis Street Church.

On the maternal side Miss Foster claims de-

and can hold a great deal, as her friends
will testify. She is never happier than when
doing something for others. It was through
jier kind solicitude, a lunnber of years ago,

active part in the mo\'emeiit, she is a stanch

of the eilucated woman of tf)-day. Of a re-

Alden Bradford' Chaney, son of Ralph" and
father of Mrs. Simpson, was born in Alna, Me.,
in August, 1816. He died August 15, 1866, in
Savannah, (ia. He was a captain in the

Mass., tUed in Manchester in 1723. He married
in Marblehead, in 1699, Ahirgaret, daugliter
of James Stilson. The eldest child l)orn of
this union was named Stilson. In 1723 Stilson
Hilton and his wife Hannah joined the churcli
in Marblehead. Their son, Samuel,' born in
Manchester, Mass., in 1741, died at Alna, Me.,
in 1809.

Samuel'' Hilton was in Colonel \\'illiani
Allen's regiment and afterward in Cajjtain
Gidding's company, Colonel Jonathan Bag-
ley's regiment of provincial troops, raised for
the invasioit-of Canada in 1759. He removed
to Alna, Me., in 1763.

In the Revolutionary War Samuel Hilton

He was one of the men raised to serve in the
Continental army from the Seventh Company,

by said Hilton, Captain, agreealile to order of
council, November 7, 1777.

The marriage of Harriet Peasley Chaney
and Greenlief A\'adleigh Simpson took place
May 29, 1866, in Bath, Me. Her home has
since been in Massachusetts. Mrs. Simpson
is a graduate of the public .schools of Batli, Me.,
including the high school.

Mr. Simpson, a Boston merchant, was born
in Alna, Me. He is a lineal descendiuit of
William' Simpson, of Brunswick, Me. The
following is a brief ancestral record: —

William' Simpson was born in Scotland in
1691. AMien a young man he removed to
the north of Ireland with his wife, Agnes
Lewis, and their small children, .^bout the
year 1728 he came to America, and settled at
New Wharf, Brunswick, Me., now known as
Simpson's Point. About seven years later his



wife came with tlieir_ two daughters, .Mary
and Jane, leaving one son, David, with his
uncle. In this countiy were born to them si.\
children — Sanmel, William, .Ir., Robert. James.
Lewis, and Josiah.

Robert' Simpson, born October 30, 1740,
married Margaret Spear, Jaiuiarv 19, 1769.
He married a second wife, .lane Given, ( )c-
tober 25, 1783. He .settled at Balltown, now
Whitetield, Me. His children were: Nancy,
Mary, Elizabeth, Jane, Margaret, and Robert,
Jr. I{()bert' Simpson, Ji'., married Bertha
Ford and had ten children — John, Lewis,
George, Abner, Nancy, Mary, Lydia. Eliza-
beth, Julia, and Abbie. John^ Simpson
married Sophronia Dole m July, 1839.
They had four children — Myrick. (ireenlief \\' .f'
Hannah E., and Thomas A.

Mr. and Mrs. Simpson have five children —
Carohne K., Clarence W., Harry J., Edna H.,
and Charles F. Their residence at Brookline
is enriched hy many art treasures collected
during their visits to foreign countries, and
also by many . ancestral relics, among them
choice pieces of furniture, invaluable for age
and family associations. While sincerely d(&gt;-
voted to her home and family, Mrs. Simpson,
with the generous co-operation of her conge-
ni;d and sympathizing hu.sband, has been able
to do more than an ordinary amount of public
work: and her efforts and success in both
walks of life may well he a lesson and exam])l('
to younger women, stalling out with many
im])ul.ses and untried pui'poses.

Mr. ami Mrs. Simp.son are niend)ers of the
Baptist church, and have labored zealous!}'
to promote its influence in the conimvmity.
Mrs. Simpson is one of the five ladies on
the executive board of the Tremont Tcnnple
Church, Boston. She has been for many
years a director of the Benevolent Society of
the church and a member of the Home and
Foreign Mission Society'. She is a constant
attendant at Tremont Temple Cluu'ch, an
active working member of its various char-
ities and .societies, and prominent in its coun-
cils. She is a charter member and director
of the Baptist Social Cnion, which s])ecially
appeals to her kindly nature, as the aim of
the society is the encouragement of a more



282

friendly interest luul association among Bap-
tist women, the promotion of a more general
Christian fellowshi]!, and the development of
larger social and mental qualities. She is
a charter member and trustee of the Home for
the Aged in Somerville, a director of the Bap-
tist Home in Cambridge, a member of the
Benevolent Social Union of the Union Scjuare
Baptist Church of Somerville, of the Somerville
Hospital Association, of the Associated Charities
of Somerville, and associated member of the
Young Women's Christian Association of Bos-
ton and Somerville. She gives her name,
money, and influence to the National Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, to the Helping
Hand Society, and the Charity Club of Boston.
Her latest philanthropic work, and one in
which her heart is deeply interested, and to
which she has given herself without stint, is
the Somerville Day Nursery, of which she is
one of the founders, being also a vice-presi-
dent.

While Mrs. Simpson finds her most conge-
nial work in her own beautiful home life and in
her many charitable enterprises, she is not
neglectful of the plea.sant demands of society
and friends. She is one of the Board of
Directors of the Daughters of Maine Club,
and is actively interested in promoting the
objects of the society. She is one of the
charter members of the Heptorean Club of
Somerville.

Into patriotic work Mrs. Simpson puts
great love and interest. For several years she
has been an efficient member of thf board of
management of the John Adams Chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolution. At
the Eleventh Continental Congress of tlie
National Society, Daughters of the Ameri-
can Revolution, held in W'ashington, D.C.,
in February, 1902, she was elected, by a very
large and flattering vote, to the office of vice-
president-general for Massachusetts. She now
belongs to some of the most im])ortant stand-
ing committees of the National Board, namely:
on Finance, on Continental Hall, on Building
Conunittee, on Ways and Means, on the Loui-
siana Purchase Exposition, and on the Ameri-
can Monthly Mar/azitie. To her arduous of-
ficial duties she has attended in such a way



as to conunand the respect and admiration of
all concerned, discharging them promptly,
ably, and thoroughly.



ELLEN BEALE MOREY was born in
Orfonlvillc, Grafton County, N.H.,
tlaughter of Royal and Josephine
(Johnson) Beal. Through her father
she claims descent from Jonathan Carver,
the traveller, who ex])lored in 1766-68 the
region immetliately .west and north-west of
the Great Lakes, then inhabited only by
Indians, with whom he was in most friendly
relations. The story of his receiving from
them the gift of a large tract of land, including
the sites of the present cities of St. Paul and
Minneapolis, though not found in the sketches
of Mr. Carver in tiie biographical cyclopaedias,
has in recent years been given newspaper pub-
licity. The deed is said to have been re-
corded upon a rock in a cave near the Falls
of St. Anthony. Jonathan Carver died in
London in 1780. He had gone there to make
arrangements for the publication of a book
giving an account of his travels and explora-
tions (a few copies of which are now in exist-
ence), and also, it is said, to try to secure a
regular deed of the land granted to him by the
Indians.

On her mother's side Mrs. Morey is a descend-
ant of Colonel Thomas Johnson, of Newbury,
Vt., who .served in the war of the Revolution,
and who was in official correspondence with
General Washington, autograph letters from
whom are still preservetl in the family.

Very early in life Ellen Beale manifested that
power and individuality of thought which led
her to differ materially with her family and
teachers in matters of opinion and practice.
Born into a pro-slavery family who had, in
earlier times, been slave-holders, she espoused
the anti-slavery cause at a time when it meant
disgrace and ostracism to do so. When a mere
child, she evinced that passion for music which
has been the dominating influence in her life,
playing from memory at four years of age selec-
tions from the gr(&gt;at composers which she had
heard her father jilny upon the pipe organ, then
as now a part of tiie family establishment.

At eleven she became organist of tlie vil-
lage church, and since that time she has played
some of the largest organs in this country
and in Europe. Her mother was her instructor
in the higher mathematics, literature, and Latin;
and her father was her first teacher in music.
It was the custom of the family to gather in
the nmsic room at evening time to sing, and
on these occasions tlie old mansion would ring
with the strains of anthem and oratorio, to
the accom]ianiment of organ, piano, violin, and
violoncello, performers upon each instrument
being found in the family circle. To her famil-
iarity with music of the best cla.ss in hei'
chihlhood, ^Irs. Morey attributes nmch of her
success.

At eighteen years of age she commenced study
with Junius W. Hill, of Boston, and remained
with him until her marriage to Herbert Iv Morey
in 1874. Of this miion there have been five
children — Eleanor Stevens, Ernest Manuel (now
deceased), Hilda Evangeline, David Beale, and
Laura Carver.

David B. and Almira (Bailey) Morey, parents
of Herbert E. Morey, were prominent among
the abolitionists, contributing of their means
to the support of the movement : and their
house was a station on the underground rail-
road. David B. Morey was closely associated
with William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips,
Parker Pillsbury, and other prominent anti-
slavery leaders. On one occasion he protected
Parker Pillsbury from a mob, holding them
off at the ])oint of a pistol, ^\'hen the war broke
out, and troops were starting for the front, the
town illuminated. He refused to illuminate his
house until he knew whether the Union was
to be with or without .slav'ery. And in this
he persisted, although notified by the town
authoi'ities, who were at that time pro-slavery
in .sentiment, that they could not promise him
protection. At the time of John lirown's raid
he with others hired Tremont Temple and per-
sisted in occupying it in spite of the opjjosition
of a pro-slavery mob encourageil by police
assistance. He was a charter member of the
Theodore Parker Fraternity.

David B. Morey was a cousin of Samuel
Morey, from whom it is said that Fulton got
his itleas of the steamboat. His wife, Almira



liailey, was daughter of Timothy Bailey, the
first president of the First National Bank of
Maiden.

In 1876 Mrs. Morey went abroad to pur-
sue her studies in piano, organ, anil theory
with Reinecke and Paul, of Leipsic, and Dr.
Theodore Kullak, of Berlin. Subsequent seasons
were spent in Rome, Florence, Milan, and Lon-
don, in the study of vocal music and instru-
mentation. Mrs. Morey in 1879 organized
a chorus and orchestra, which she lierself con-
ducted, being the first woman, sij far as is
known, to use the conductor's baton. Her skill
as a director and chorus leader is well known
to the nuisical world; and, hail it not been for
her extreme modesty and disinclination for
pul)lic life, her name and fame would have been
world-wide. There are few men, it has been
said, among those famous in the world to-day,
who have the skill to teach, or the magnetic
personality to control and get results from a
body of singers, which she i)o.ssesses. She has
spent several seasons at Baireuth, and has been
a close student of Wagner and his methods.
Indeed, music has meant a life work to this re-
markable woman. Through it she has striven
to ennoble mankind by bringing to it a con-
sciousness of those great thoughts which she
conceives to be embodied in all art. As she
says: "Music was never either an anuisement
or an a?stheticism to me, but that solenm and
ineffable voice in the .soul which has been
proclaiming its messages down through the ages
in all true art, whether in form, color, or sound."
This .sentiment she brings out most emphatically
in her lectures upon music, of which she has
several.

Mrs. Morey has always ke])t herself in the
background, but her jjupils, who are scattered
throughout the land, can testify, as did one who
has achieved fame in a large city: "I was one
of Mrs. Morey's earliest pupils, and I have
never forgotten either the impetus to work, the
emulation of high ideals which .she instilled into
me, or the inspiration which made study with
her a delight."

AVhile she was director of music and organist
of the First Church in Maiden, the musical critic
of one of Boston's leading ])apers wrote the
following in a report of one of the church scr-



284

vices: "Ak-ntion has not been inade of tlic
organ jirclude nor of the handling of the organ
throughout the solo and chorus work tiu'ough
failure to ai)i)reciate the versatility and skill
required in their execution. The gifted woman
who has brought the music in this cluuch to
rank with the first in the land, and who in
the last ten years has done more to ennoble
antl spiritualize the work of music in the church
than any one within the writer's knowledge,
brhigs to her position not only special aptitude,
but skill acquired by intense and unrenutting
study, an artistic style born of acf}uaint-
anceshi]) with the best music of many ]ieo]iles
and lands, and, what is still more im])ortant,
a realization of the soul of things whicli finds
utterance in the majestic strains of Te Deum
and oratorio. . If the musical attractions of
this church are sufficient to call the attention
of musicians from Boston, who, like myself,
come on all extra occasions and frequently
at other times, purposely to hear its chorus
singing, it is safe to say it nuist possess somc^
distinguishing excellence. I am only one of
several who have expressed the opinion that,
were this choir within Boston limits, the present
church edifice would be entirely inadecjuate to
seat the peojjle who would throng there to
hear its music. Mrs. Morey combines genius
and physical strength to a degree seldom found
in woman, and from this union we expect and
find great things."

Mrs. Morey's extensive travel has brought
her in touch with the musical and artistic
centres of Europe. Her summers for twenty
years have been spent among the Alps of
Switzerland, Northern Italy, and the Tyrol,
into who.se very fastnesses she has penetrated.
She has made her abode with peasants and
princes alike, from the humblest chalet of
Switzerland to the abodes of I'^ngland's aris-
tocracy; amid the sand-dunes and windmills
of the Low Countries and the castles of the
.Rhine; in the wastes of the Sahara and under
the shadow of Egypt's great monuments.

Cosmo])olitan alike by travel and tempera-
ment, finding home and friends in many lands,
her heart, never thele.ss, remains loyal to the
granite hills of the land of her birth — the
Switzerland of America.



ETTA HALEY OSGOOD, the first Presi-
dent of the Maine PVderation of Clubs,
was born in Chatham, Carroll County,
N.H. When she was two years old,
her parents, Thomas Jewett and Lucrctia lOaton
(Colby) Haley, removed acro.ss the bordc-r to
the town of Stow, Oxford County, Me., and,
having been a resident of that State ever since,
.she felicitates herself on being a Maine woman.

She was educated in the public schools, at
Fryeburg Academy, and at Mount Holyoke
Seminary, where she was enrolled as a student
vmder her maiden name, Etta Haley, in the
school years 1S7-1-75 and 1S75-76. P]tta
Haley's early lessons were conned in the town
school of Stow, kejit in the little red school-
house. That she appreciated the opportuni-
ties afTorded by the higher institutions of learn-
uig is shown by the fact that at the age of
sixteen, in order to secure them, she began
teaching school. She continued to teach at
intervals until her marriage in October, 1877,
to lidward Sherburne Osgood, of Portland.

Mr. Osgood was on the editorial staff of the
Portland Arfius, and he encouraged his wife to
enter the profession of joui'nalism. She began
by reporting conventions, society events, and
so forth, and in recent years has devoted the
greater part of her time to this work. She is
now on the editorial staff of tlie Evening Ex-
press and Sunday Telegram.

^^dlen the club movement began, Mrs. Os-
good was one of the pioneers. She has assisted
in founding several clubs, and is considered an
authority in matters relating to i)arliamentary
law, her lectures on this subject being one of
the results of her club and newspaper work.

The following is a list of the offices she has
held in various organizations; fii'st i)resident of
the International Health Protective League;
first president of the Maine Federation of
Clubs: founder of the Mount Holyoke Alumna'
Association of Maine: first chairman of Corre-
spondence for Maine of General Federation of
Women's Clubs and one of the directors; secre-
tary of the Suffrage Association (serving ten
years), also its vice-president and State organ-
izer: a member of the New England Woman's
Press Club; parliamentarian of the Maine Fed-
eration; conunissioner from Maine to the x\.t-

ALICE MARY STEKVES, D.D.S., was
/ \ born September 13, 1869, in Upper
X A. Coverdale, in the county of Albert,
Province of New Brunswick, Canada.
Her parents, William Whitfield and Almyra
Ann (Wallace) Sleeves, are still living at the
homestead. The Sleeves family of New Bruns-
wick is of Pennsylvania Dutch extraction, the
original form of the name having been Stief.

In May, 1763, as stated in a book of New
Brun.swick biographies, Hendrick' Sleeves with
his wife Rachel and seven sons — Jacob, John,
Christian, Frederic, Ludwig (or Lewis), Henry,
and Matthias — came from Pennsylvania to
New Brunswick, and was one of the pioneer
settlers of Albert County.

Dr. Steeves's paternal grandi)arents were
Abel and Leah (Sleeves) Sleeves, and her great-
grandfathers on that side were Hendrick, Jr.
(or Henry), and his brother, Ludwig (or Lewis)
Sleeves, sons of Hendrick' Steeves.

On her mother's side Dr. Steeves is partly
of Scottish blood, her grandparents being John
and Sarah (Chapman) A^'allace, both native
residents of Albert County, New Brunswick.
Her grandfather Wallace, was a large land-
owner. He gave each of his three sons
a farm. Her grandmother's mother, whose
maiden name was Sarah Black, belonged to
that branch of the Black family in America
whose home for many years was on the site
of the present city of Halifax, where some of
their dc^scendants still live.



Robert Black and William Chapman, ances-
tors of Dr. Steeves, were granted large tracts
of land in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for
services to the British crown, and were among
the pioneers of the new country, formerly
Acadie.

Alice M. Steeves was the eldest daughter in
a family of twelve children. She received her
education in the conmion schools and high
school; and by her two aunts, Mrs. Morton and
Mrs. Vaughan, her mother's sisters, was so well
trained in the domestic arts of housekeeping
and needlework that at the age of fourteen she
managed the affairs of the faniily for her
mother, who.se health at this time was not good.

The greatest character-forming factor in her
early training was her association with her
uncle, Judge Finemore Morton, who carefully
drilled her in practical affairs of life, and who
tried to have her study law with him. The
law being considered by Mrs. Morton, her aunt,
a very unwomanly ])rofession, its study had
to be given up. Early in 1889, having decided
to become a nurse, she came to Boston and en-
tered for a two years' course of study the Train-
ing School for Nurses connected with the Massa-
chusetts General Hospital. Capable, efficient,
and mature beyontl her years, she gained the
respect and good will of all with whom .she asso-
ciated, and at the end of eighteen months was
promoted to a head nurseshijx She was grad-
uated in February, 1891, and in the autumn
of that year she resigned her ])osition to take
a similar one in the Garfield Memorial Hospital
in Washington, D.C., where she remained only
a short time, when she resigned to do private
work in that city. In October, 1892, she was
appointed resident nurse at Talcott Hall, (_)ber-
lin College, Oberlin, Ohio, and while there did
special work on the classics. Resigning in
1893, she went to Chicago to attend the World's
Fair and to conduct special work in that city.
In October, 1894, after many unsuccessful at-
tempts to be admitted to the Northwestern
University Dental School on an equal footing
with men, she matriculated at the American
College of Dental Surgery in Chicago, which
in 1895 became amalgamated with the North-
western University Dental School. From that
institution, which had thrice refused her ad-



286



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



mittance, she was graduated in 1897, in a class
of one hundred and twenty-six, with highest
honors. One of the professors speaking of her
at this time said, "She carries with her the
confidence of the faculty, the highest esteem of
her fellow-students, and possesses strong ele-
ments of character that will win success in any
calling."

In 1898 she was appointed assistant to the
chair of oral surgery in the Northwestern Uni-
versity Dental School, being the first woman
to serve on its faculty She was also appointed
clinical instructor in stomatology in the Woman's
Medical College of Northwestern University in
the same year, while also pursuing the practice
of dentistry.

Through special work ilone in the interest of
a broader medical edvication for dental practice
Dr. Steeves became a member of the American
Medical Association, and has made a good record
in this society. She is also an active member
in the Chicago Dental Society, Massachusetts
Dental Society, and of her various alumni
associations.

Although perhaps all that fortune could give
in so short a time had fallen to our heroine's
lot in the busy city of Chicago, she longed for
the more sedate and settled atmosphere of New
England. She therefore passed the Board of
Dental Examiners of Massachusetts in March,
1902, and removed her office from Chicago to
Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, on the first
of May following. She was appointed consult-
ing dentist to Trinity Dispensary, June, 1902,
and attending dentist to the Academy of the
Assumption, of Wellesley, Mass., in October,
1902. She is also dentist to the Homoeopathic
Dispensary, Boston, and has recently been ap-
pointed attending dentist to the Industrial
School for Girls at Lancaster, Mass. She is
much interested in securing proper oral condi-
tions in children of the public schools.

Dr. Steeves is a strong advocate of co-etluca-
tion, believing that women should have the
same opportunities for mental training and for
development of character and capacity from
childhood up as men. And with her it is once
a student, always a student: it never enters her
mind to be satisfied witii present attainments,
to forego an opportunity for original research.



ANNE PILSBURY.— Within a few years

/ \ there has coni(&gt; into existence what is
X jLfc known as the new school of photog-
ra])hy, for which P'. Holland Day,
Mrs. Kasebier, Francis Watts Lee, and others
have won wide recognition. Among the
younger members of this school, Miss Pilsbury,
during the four years she has been at work as
a photogra])her, has made for herself a rather
enviable place. Older photographers of the
new school have s])oken warndy of her work,
while what has perhaps pleased her most has
been praise from men who are working in the
conventional way, but who speak appreciatively
of what she is iloing.

She has had, of course, to meet the criti-
cism which has very natui'ally greeted all this
new-school photography, or artistic photogra-
phy, as it has been called. This term lias been
used to cover nuich work, both good and bad,
and has become a term of reproach to many
people. To them it means simply a picture
out of focus, and either very shadowy or with
those strong contrasts of light and shade sup-
posed by some to give a truly Remlirandt
effect; for they often seize upon extravagances
connnitted in the name of artistic photography
as its worthy representatives. A photograph
to be good in their eyes must be sharply fo-
cussed, with all its details distinct. They
hardly realize that there is room for another,
method. At the recent caricature show in
Boston was exhibited an almost invisible picture
of a baby mounted in one corner of a large
card, bearing the notice, "Special attention
given to ]:)hotographs of children."

Miss Pilsbury began lier work five years ago
by studying with .Miss WcW, of Philadelphia.
In the spring of 1S99 she came to Boston, rented
a studio on Boylston Street, in what was once
an old dwelling-house, and courageously began
business among a host of well-known ])ho-
tographers. The original ciiaracter of her work
gradually brought her into notice, and her
reputation spread. While Miss Pilsbury lays
no claim to high artistic achievement, she has
made it her .aim in her professional work, by
the substitution of simple nietliods for the older
stilted methods, to .secure for parents records
of the unconscious charm of their children.

and in Ikt portraits of older people has worked
for natural and at the same time slightly ideal-
ized results.

It is in her portraits of children that she es-
pecially excels: children, feeling that she un-
derstands them and sympathizes with them,
are at ease with her. She sometimes uses a
simple flat lighting, suggesting Boutet de
Monvel's pictures of children. Her best por-
traits are noticeable for their unstudied pose,
softness of outline, and interesting lighting,
an excellent example being a picture of an old
lady seated by a window, the play of light and
shade over her face softening it very charm-
ingly.

Miss Pilsbury has made a distinct advance
each year in the character of her work. She
is not content to stand still or to follow in one
beaten track. This spirit of experiment antl
revolt from the conventional has made her
work uneven. She has perhaps attempteil more
than she could carry out, for a lens has many
limitations. But the mistakes she has made
have been just so many encouraging signs of
progress. In the end she has gained.

Miss Pilsbury is a member of the Arts and
Crafts Society of Boston. She has exhibited
in the Photographic Salon of Philadelphia, in
the Salon of the Linketl Ring in London, and
in several other cities.



JOSEPHINE ROACHE was born in the
pretty village of Beaver River, on the
shores of the Bay of Fundy, in the
country of Evangeline, June 25, LS45.
Her father, Israel Roache, was born in Gran-
ville, N.S., being a son of Frederick and Eliza-
beth (Ricketson) Roache.

His father, Frederick Roache, a native and
lifelong resident of Granville, dietl at the age
of ninety on the farm that had been his home
for' many years. He was a man of indepen-
dent opinions, taking an active interest in pub-
lic affairs and in promoting the welfare of the
village. His ancestors came to America from
Waterford, Ireland, in the early part of the
eighteenth century.

Israel Roache's mother was a refined and
delicate woman. Her ancestoi's went to Nova



Scotia from Mrginia before the breaking out
of the Revolution, doubtless leaving some of
their kinsfolk in that State, as the name Rick-
etson, it is said, is still known in the South.

The maiden name of Josephine Roache's
mother was Almira Corning. Her earliest
ancestor in America, Sanuiel Corning, who
arrived in Salem, Mass., as early as 1638, was
among the founders of Beverly, where there
is now Corning Street, named for the family.
Her father, Daniel Corning, was one of the
first settlers of Beaver River, having left Bev-
(&gt;rly some years before the Revolution. Her
mother, Mrs. Abigail Perry Corning, also be-
longed to a family that went from Massa-
chusetts to Nova Scotia before the Revolution.
Mr. and Mrs. Israel Roache, wishing to edu-
cate their children in the United States, the
])ublic school .system not then having been
introduced into the British Provinces, came
to Salem, Mass., when Josephine, the eldest
child, was six years old. At the breaking out
of the Civil War Mr. Roache enlisted in the
Thirty-fifth (Massachusetts) Regiment. He
was in the laattles and campaigns shared by the
Ninth Army Corps, at South Mountain, An-
tietam, and later in the battles of the ^^'il-
derness; and at the battle of Cold Harbor he
was taken prisoner, and, after a short con-
finement at Libby Prison, was sent to Andcr-
sonville, where he ilied in 1864.

Josephine Roache received her education
in Massachusetts schools. Her first teaching
was in Danversport, whither the family had
removed after a few years' sojourn in Salem.
Later she taught in Salem, Danvers, and Lynn,
being connected over twenty years with the
Lynn schools. Since leaving public school
work, she has conducted classes in literature
and current events in Lynn, Salem, and Dan-
vers, and has been a prominent member in the
Lynn Women's Club and the Outlook Club.
She has also lectured liefore many clubs in
New England.

From early childhood her love for good
literature has increased year by year. ?Ier
influence in guiding the literary taste of the
high school pupils who came under her teach-
ing was a strong one, the result being that,
as college professors have given testimony,



288



RErRESENTATlVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



they were more advanced in literature than
pupils from similar schools. She had the rare
ability of telling pupils just enough to awaken
in them the desire to read every author she
touciied upon. This ability, she often says,
was inheriteil from her mother, who was an
excellent raconteur, and who inspired her
with a love for the best in the world of books.

Miss Roache is a poet of no mean al)ility,
having written verses for many public occa-
sions, among them the hynm sung at the lay-
ing of the corner-stone of the Lynn High School,
and the poem calletl " The Story of the Okl
Elm Tree," written for the celebration of the
two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the
town of Danvers.

Perhaps no better estimate of her character
and work can be made than the following,
written by a co-worker in the Lynn High
School, who has been able to trace her influ-
ence in the lives of many that came under her
instruction during a ]ieriod of nearly forty
years :—

" In the summer of 1881 I first became ac-
quainted with Miss Josephine Roache. At
that time she was an assistant in the Lynn
High School; and for ten years thereafter, in
one capacity or another, I was associated with
her in- the work of that school, and learned to
know and value her excellent (lualities as
teacher and woman.

"Her special department was English lit-
erature: and she certainly was posses.sed fif
remarkable power to interest the young people,
perhaps more especially girls, in that sub-
ject. Her methods evidenced a conviction
on her part that the way to teach English lit-
erature to ]iui)ils enovigh advanced to be in
high school .should by no means be limited
to a dissection and critical analysis of the
.sentences, or even of the entire composition.
One saw at once that it was her higher aim
to make the pupils' hearts and souls respond
to the author's thought. Her low, soft, well-
modulated voice bespoke the perfect self-
control; and she .scorned to govern her cla.s.ses
by means inconsistent with a self-respecting
and dignified womanly character.

"At the time Miss Roache left the high
school, the English de|)artment suffereil a



blow from which it has never wholly recov-
ered.

"Outside of her school, in the every-day
affairs of life, she was altogether prone to
espouse the cause of the suffering and op-
pressed. She was an ardent advocate of Home
Rule for Ireland, and never missed an oppor-
tunity by tongue or pen to advance it. I
think majority opinions had little weight with
her, except as they commended themselves
to her heail and heart. She believed that
Edward B(&gt;llainy's theories are in the right
direction, and she was an active member of
the Nationalist Club of Lynn, formed in the
eighties, associating in the work with such
men and women as Dr. Benjamin Percival,
Hannah M. Todd, CJeorge H. Carey, Dr. p]sther
H. Hawkes, and Herman Kemp.

"Miss Roache is scholarly, but to an ex-
tent that I have never seen surpassed she pre-
serves the well-springs of human nature from
drovight that cultm;e so frecpiently induces.
She is a scholar indeed; but she never forgets
that her first duty is to humanity as a whole,
and not to any particular cliciue or class."



EVELYN TUCK COOK, a Past Depart-
ment President of the W^oman's Relief
Cor]is of I\Lassachusptts, was born in
Manchester, Mass., June 26, 1849, daugh-
ter of Captain Charles and Sophia (Lendall)
Leach. Her father, who commanded the bark
" Marguerite." died in March, 1852, on the voy-
age from South America to Boston, Mass.
]*'velyn was then in her third year. She was
educated in the public schools of her native
town. On February 24, 1869, .she was mar-
ried to Colonel Benjamin Franklin Cook, of
Gloucester, Mn.'^s., son of Captain Jeremiah
Cook and his wife, Harriet Tarr, who was daugh-
ter of Captain Jabez Tarr, of Bunker Hill fame.
For more than thirty years Mrs. Cook has
been engaged in work for the Grand Army of
the Republic. She was a charter member of
Clara Barton Lodge, formed May 13, 1870,
as an auxiliary to Colonel Allen Post, G. A. R.,
of C^doucester. She was elected its first Treas-
urer, and then served as President .six consecu-
tive t(Tms. \\hen Colonel Allen Relief Corps

was instituted, December 18, 1886, she was
elected President, hoUling the office three years.
She served in several other positions, and was
Department Instituting and Installing Officer
in 1889. In 1890 she was chief Aide on the
staff of Mrs. Mary E. Knowles, Department
President, and in 1891 wfts Department Cor-
responding Secretary. In 1892 she was chosen
a member of the Department Executive Board,
and the following year was elected Depart-
ment Junior \'ice-President. She was pro-
moted to the office of Senior Vice-President
in 1894, and at the annual convention held in
S})ringfield, Mass., Fel)ruary, 1895, was unani-
mously elected Department Pn'sident. When
accepting the office she said; "I pledge my
best efforts in every way. Tenderly as I have
guarded my own name and lionor during my
life, so I will guard the honoi- of tlic Depart-
ment of Massachusetts."

Mrs. Cook addressed many gatherings through-
out the State, and her elotjuent appeals al-
ways commanded attention. Great interest
was manifested in all the work. In a general
order issued July 13, 1895, she re(|uested corps
presidents to fill out an enclosed blank, con-
taining a list of questions regarding the intro-
duction of a flag salute in th(&gt; public schools.
Referring to this line oi work, she said: "At
no time since the Civil War has the fact been
more apparent that le.ssons of loyalty and love
of country should be inculcated in the minds
of the children. The members of this Depart-
ment nmst realize that a grand opportunity
is theirs to carry out one of the principles of
our order."

On May 30, 1889, Mrs. Cook delivered a
memorial address at Southbridge in the after-
noon and one at West Metlway in the evening.
Her Memorial Day order to the corps was a
heartfelt tribute to the nation's heroes. The
following paragi'aph is wortliy of preservation:
"As we scatter the chaplets and garlands,
fragrant with the sweetness of spring, on the
spot of gi'een which covers the mounds of our
nation's benefactors, may we open our hearts
to the teachings of the hour anil the sacredness
of the ceremony, light anew the fires of patri-
otism, and renew our ])ledges of life and sacred
honor to transmit unsullied to our children



this noble heritage of ours! And, while we
meet around these altars of our love, may we
give a thought of affection to those far-ofT
graves marked with (hat one word, ' Unknown'!
Unknown, perhaps, the name; yet he was a
soldier of the Union. Unknown, perhaps, his
rank, his birthplace, or religion; but known
he was a brother who gave his life for freeilom.
In this fair land are other graves still for us
to aiJinoach with reverence. &lt; )ur sister women,
whose love of country was shown in action and
whose sympathj" for suffering was stronger
than life, while we may not lay our offering of
love upon their graves, we can give a tender
thought to their memories and strive to make
our womanhood as true as theirs. Bring into
the day's service the young children, and teach
them by our exam|)le, as well as by what is
said to them, that we can hold the day sacred.
Let them assist in preparing tlie flowers and
the wreaths, and make them understand that
it is a holy day as well as a holiday, to be kept
sacredly. Let every niembei' of our order feel
it her especial duty to join in the service of
the day."

Mrs. Cook had charge of the delegation to
the Thirteenth National Convention, which
met in Louisville, Ky., in September, 1895.
At the opening session of the convention Mrs.
Cook was appointed chairman of the Commit-
tee on Appeals, and made an able report. It
was she who had the honor of nominating Mrs.
Lizabeth A. Turner, of Boston, as a candidate
for the office of National President. The No-
tional Tribune referred to this effort as "the
gem of nominating speeches." Upon return-
ing from Louis\ille Mrs. Cook again entered
zealously into the work in Massachusetts. In
a general order issued November 11 she made
an appeal for additional contributions for the
Department Relief Fund and also for the Sol-
diers' Home. She asked the corps to make
" the coming Christmastide one long to be re-
membered by sending boxes of clothing and
delicacies such as are common to this festive
season."

AMien reviewing the work of the year in her
address at the annual convention held in Low-
ell, February, 1896, she .^aid: "I find that in
point of numljers and in relief given we are



290

still the banner department. I trust that we
may be able to claim this in every department
in which our line of work takes us. There is
peace within our borders, and sitlc by side with
our comrades we stand for every good we can
accomplish under the banner upon which is in-
scribed the principles of the Grand Army of the
Republic — Fraternity, Charity, and Loyalty."

In referring to the Soldiers' Home she .said :
" If there is one spot more than another that
the loving care and devotion of the true-hearted
women of our department centres around, it
is this home, where to-day rest in peace the
war-worn antl crippled veterans who have
fought the battles of their country and are
entitled to all that we can do to make their
last days those of peace and comfort."

She recommendetl that all corps be requested
to appoint a Soldiers' Home Committee,
whether they have a room in the home or not,
this committee to arrange that at least once
a year a donation of either money or articles
be sent to the home.

Among other subjects of interest that were
ably considered by Mrs. Cook was the flag sa-
lute. Concerning this she expressed the fol-
lowing sentiments: "Our country's flag — how
our hearts thrill with pride, as we watch its
graceful folds as they float in the breeze of
heaven, antl think that on every sea, in every
port where conmierce finds its way, wherever
civilization has its home and human free-
dom has an inspiration, that ensign is wel-
comed and beloved! It speaks to us by all
the memories of the past to do all in our power
to maintain this heritage. Realizing that in
this symbol we do see the world's best hope
for civil and religious liberty, our organiza-
tion has taken upon itself the task, believing
it to be a duty as well as a privilege, to use
every legitimate means to have the salute
to the flag introduced into the public schools.
Should not our children be taught that the flag
is the guardian of all their most treasured inter-
ests? By this we hope, too, that a new spirit of
patriotism maybe awakened in the community."

Her administration was a successful one,
Mrs. Cook being guided by a sincere desire
faithfully to serve the Department of Massa-
chusetts, over which she liad the honor to rule.



Benjamin I'\ Cook enlisted in April, 1861,
as private in Company K, Twelfth Massachu-
setts Regiment. He was commissioned First
Lieutenant, January 26, 1862; Captain, May 2,
1862; Major, July 23, 1863; and Lieutenant
Colonel, May 6, 1864. The regiment, com-
manded by Colonel Fletcher Webster, left
Boston July 24, and three days later was sta-
tioned on the Maryland side of the Potomac
River, about a mile from Harper's Ferry. It
participated in many of the leading battles
of the war. On the skirmish line at Peters-
burg the Twelfth received orders " to drive
the foe from their entrenchments on the rail-
road." Colonel Bates reported: "This was
performed under Lieutenant Colonel Cook in
gallant style, advancing so far that the re-
mainder of the brigade thought they had been
taken prisoners." In July, 1864, the regi-
ment reached Boston with one hundred and
seventy men. Colonel Cook commanded the
regiment in several campaigns, principally with
the Army of the Potomac, antl was under fire
more than sixty times. He has served as
president of the regimental association, and
he is the author of the interesting " History
of the Twelfth Regiment," which was pub-
lished in 1882. His wife aided him in collect-
ing data for this volume, and served as his
amanuensis.

Colonel Cook has been prominent in the
affairs of Gloucester for many years, and has
served three times as Mayor of the city. He
represented Gloucester in the Legislature of
Massachu.setts for three years in succession.
He is a member of Colonel Allen Post, G. A. R.,
and of other organizations.

Colonel and Mrs. Cook have had five chil-
dren, three of whom — namely, Frank How-
ard (born in 1869), Edwin Friend (1875), and
Fletcher Webster (1878) — died in infancy.
The survivors are: Mary Franklin, born March
24, 1871, who married Professor Harrison Gray
Otis Chase, of Tufts College; and Eva Len-
dall, born September 16, 1873, now teacher
of Greek and Latin in the Taconic School, Lake-
ville, Conn.

Mrs. Cook has lived in Gloucester ever since
her marriage, and is interested in all the good
work of the city. She has been identified

with the UniversaUst church, but for the past
few years has taken great interest in Christian
Science, being an active member of the Glouces-
ter church as well as of tlie " Mother Church"
in Boston.



ISABELLA ABBE POTTER, now serv-
ing her seventh year as president of the
Woman's Club House corporation, hav-
ing been first elected in 1898, and re-
elected for the sixth time in January, 1904,
is the wife of a well-known business man of
Boston, \A'illiam W. Potter, and resides in
Brookline. Born in the town of Lee, Berk-
shire County, Mass., daughter of Porter and
Rubina (Abbe) Strickland, she comes of long
lines of New England ancestors, extending back
to the early settlement of the Bay Colony.

Her father was a native of Amherst, Mass.,
and son of Francis L. Strickland and Jerushy
Gaylord. Her mother was daughter of Oba-
diah and Margaret (Marsh) Abbe and grand-
daughter of Lemuel Marsh, whose father, John
Marsh, was graduated from Harvard College in
1726.

Througli Lemuel Marsh Mrs. Potter is de-
scended from the Rev. John Wilson, the first
minister of Boston, and from the Rev. Thomas
Hooker, of Hai'tford, the families of these two
Puritan ilivines being united by the marriage
of Mr. Wilson's son, the Rev. John Wilson, Jr.,
first minister of Medfield, Mass., and Mr.
Hooker's dauglUer Sarah. John Wilson, third,
born of this union in 1660, became a physician,
and settled in Braintree. His tlaughter, Sarah
Wilson, married in 1701 John Marsh, Sr., and
was the mother of John Marsh, born in Brain-
tree in 1702, above mentioned as tlie father
of Lemuel and grandfather of Margaret Marsh,
Mrs. Potter's maternal grandmother.

The early education of Mrs. Potter, received
in the public schools of Springfield, Mass.,
was supplemented by a three years' course
of private instruction in music, languages,
physical culture, and practical kindergarten
work. She then — still bearing her maiden
name of Strickland — became an enthusiastic
and successful teacher, holding the position of
principal of a group of schools in Springfield.



Miss Strickland was the first teacher to intro-
duce object teaching and kind(&gt;rgarten work
into those schools. She left teaching to become
the wife of William \\'alker Potter, a success-
ful Boston business man, trustee of Boston
University, member of the Wesleyan Asso-
ciation and other organizations. They were
married May 21, 1873, and have since resided
in their beautiful home in Brookline. They
have one child, Helen Wilson I^otter.

Thus writes one who knows: —

"Although Mrs. Potter's preferences are
decidedly for literary work, slie has always been
sought for church, charitable, and philanthropic
enterprises. She has been a leatler and emi-
nently successful in them all.

"She and her husband were for fourteen
years workers in Harvartl Church, Brookline,
until the cry came from a weaker society,
struggling unsuccessfully to get a footing in
the same town, to come over and help them.
They gave of their money, but that was not
enougfi. The personal element and influence
was needed, or there could be no hope of suc-
cess. The result was, they left their own
home church, joined forces with the weaker
society, and the beautiful St. Mark's Church
of Brookline is to-day a monument to their
fidelity and devotion.

"Mrs. Potter has been for years the treasurer
of the Brookline Woman's Exchange, treasurer
of the Massachusetts Home for Intemperate
Women, treasurer of the First Needlework
Guild of Boston, vice-president of the Boston
Business League, a member of the New Eng-
land Woman's Club, the Castilian and Charity
Clubs, the New England Woman's Press Asso-
ciation, and the Club House Corporation Club,
of which she has just been elected president.

" She is a cjuiet, dignified, courageous, and
resourceful woman. Feeling that responsibility
is the exacting companion of capacity and power,
her business and executive ability are conse-
crated, that she may render the greatest possible
good to the greatest number. She devotes
the best of herself in all that she undertakes.
Few women have a wider acquaintance." ,

It may be added that the handsome New
Century Building on Huntington Avenue stands
in evidence of the business enterprise and sagac-

ity of the Wonian'.s Club House Corporation
under the guidance of Mrs. Potter. In this
building are Howe TTall, Potter Hall, Woolson
Hall, and Sewall Hall, named after prominent
club women, the last-mentioned after Mrs. J.
Sewall Reed, treasurer of the corporation.

As facetiously noted by Mrs. Abba Goold
Woolson at the dedication, it was owing to
the firm faith and active assistance of an Isa-
bella that the continent of America was dis-
covered, and it was through the opportune
"discovery of an Isabella" a few years ago that
had been achieved the present happy result —
the fulfilment of long-cherished hopes wherefore
club women of Boston and vicinity have reason
to feel grateful.



SERAPH FRIS.SELL, M.D., was born in
Peru, Berkshire County, Mass., August
20, 1840, being the daughter of Augus-
tus Ca\'*ar and Laura Mack (Emmons)
Frissell. Her grandparents were Thomas and
Hannah (Phillips) Frissell and IchalH)d and
Mindwell (Mack) Emmons.

Her father and her paternal grandfather
served, each in his day, as Captain of militia.
W^illiam Frissell, her great-grandfather, served
his country in the Revolutionary War. For
military services, see Records of Connecticut
for the Revolutionary War, pp. 27, 56, 389.

David Mack, great-grandfather of Dr. Fris-
sell, was one of the earliest settlers in Middle-
field, Hami)shire County, Mass., going to that&lt;
locality in 1775, and was one of the founders
of the town. He enlisted (from Hebron, Conn*. )■
in the Revolutionary War, but saw no -"/we
service, arriving too late to take part i.i'the
battle of Saratoga. He was a Captain of trooi)s
engaged in suppressing Shays's Rebellion, and
afterward was Colonel of a regiment.

Seraph Frissell was the third in a family of
six children, and was but eleven years old
when her father died, leaving her mother with
limited means for their support. Her girl-
hood years were divided between domestic
wor^, a factory girl's life, and school life.

During these years she saved enough to defray
her expenses for one year at Mount Holyoke
Seminary.



The fall of ISOl found hi-r a .student at this
institution, from which she was graduated in
.July, 1809, having completed the four years'
course in three years, in the meanwhile teaching
f(,)r live years. ^

In 1867 she received from the American
Board of Missions the appointment of mission-
ary to Ceylon, but in deference to her mother's
wi.shes .she did not enter upon this work.

Beginning the study of medicine in 1872
under Doctors Ruth Gerry and Cynthia
Sniitli, of Ypsilanti, Mich., .she received her
diploma from the Department of Medicine
and Surgery of the University of Michigan on
March 24, 1875. She had hosi)ital j^ractice in
Detroit, Ypsilanti, and Boston. In 1876 she
began the general practice of her profession in
Pittsfield, Mass., where slie remained for eight
years. Since then she has been a resilient of
Springfield.

Dr. Frissell became a member of Hamjxlen
County Medical Society in 1885, being the
first woman in Western Massachu.setts to be
admitted to any district medical society. She
was the fourth woman to be admitted a mem-
ber of the Massachusetts Medical Society. She
is an honorary member of the Alumna' Asso-
ciation of the AVoman's Medical College, Phil-
adelphia; a member of the Mercy Warren
Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion; of E. K. Wilcox Relief Corps; of the
American Medical Association; of the Spring-
field Mount Holyoke Alumna' Association; of
the Alumna^ Association of Michigan I'niver-
sity; and of the College Club.

In 1896 Dr. Frissell took a course in elec-
trotlieraj^eutics. For some time she has been
medical examiner for the Berkshire Life In-
■■■''rance Company. She is a memlier of the

.rst Congregational Church of Springfield.
During her residence in Pittsfield she was
elected the first president of the Woman's
Chiistian Temperance Union of that city. For
seven years she was president of the Woman's
Board of Missions of the South Church. She
has been superintendent of the Department of
Heredity and Health, Woman's Christian Tem-
perance Union, for Hampden County; and
diu'ing 1890-91 she was resident physician and
lecturer on physiology and hygiene at IMount

Holyoke College. Her specialty has been di-
seases of women and chiklren. While devoted
to her profession, she is interested in the pro-
gressive movements of the day, ami her sym-
pathies are as broad as humanity.

Dr. Fris.sell is the author of several inter-
esting papers, notal)ly one on Memorial Day in
Hampton, Va. She presented before the Amer-
ican Medical Association a valuable paper on the
treatment of diphtheria without alcoliol, which
was published in the American Medical Associa-
tion Journal, November 13, 1897. She has
also written papers on the following topics:
"Tobacco," "Contents of a Teapot," "Why
I'm a Temperance Doctor," "Hygiene: Why
it should be taught in our Public Schools,"
"Prevention better than Cure," "Colonial
Flags and the Evolution of the Stars and
Stripes," also "Pioneer Women in Medicine."



AE DURELL FRAZAR was born
Calais, Me. Her father, the



m



J^^ Y J_ Rev. George Wells Durell, was
an Episcopalian clergyman. The
early years of her life were spent in the
quiet New England town of her birth. Later
the family removed to Somerville, Mass.,
where she attended the public schools. She
married General Douglas Frazar, a gentleman
who had travelled widely and had nmch
literary attainment. He was the author of
several books, one of which, "Practical Boat
Sailing," has been translated into many lan-
guages, and is in use to-day among all standard
yacht clubs. When asked where she received
her education, Mrs. Frazar answers: "Why,
I am being educated now. It has been a
daily growth right along. All that I am.
however, I feel that I owe to Mr. Frazai.
In my own home I learned rich lessons from
books, people, and the world."

Mrs. Frazar is, doubtless, the best known
and the most enterjirising and successful
if not the only woman tourist agent in the
LTnited States. She is a cheery, wide-awake
body, full of originality and up-to-date ideas.
The story of the life of the woman who has
personally conducted abroad, with skill and
.satisfaction during the past twelve years,



the "Frazar Parties," frecjuently mentioned
in the newspapers of our own antl other coun-
tries, is most interesting.

A chance visitor will find her in her office
at almost any hour of the day, busy at her
desk; for she is a journalist and lecturer as
well as guide and philosopher. She is so
calm in manner, so full of courteous attention
to her caller, that it is difficult to realize what
an indefatigable worker the woman is. Quick
and keen in business, energetic, courageous
in expressing her views, she is yet a most
womanly woman. Contact with the world
has not robbed her of her strong personality
or her feminine refinement.

It was after several years of intermittent
newsjiaper writing that Mrs. Frazar became
editor and publisher of a paper called The
Home Life. As the name implies, it was
meant to be useful and instructive to all
members of the family. It was a journal
of sixteen pages and of excellent literary
cpiality. She eilited it entirely herself and
attended to all the ailvertising, bringing the
circulation up in three years to over ten thou-
sand copies. When engaged in this work
she came in contact with all sorts antl con-
ditions of men, and gained an intimate knowl-
edge of business life.

Yielding to an urgent recjuest to take charge
of a party of young people during a European
trip, she returned to find General Frazar's
health failing. A change of climate was
(.rdered, and they took up their residence
in the city of Mexico. This change necessi-
tated giving up the paper. Being sole owner
of i' business, she quickly arranged with
anotiiL-r journal to fill her subscriptions until
their expiration. She retained all the copy-
rights, and looks forward to the day when
she shall have opportunity to give The Home
Life a new lease of existence.

While in Mexico she made a careful study
of the people and their customs, ami furnished
a' syndicate of nine papers with letters during
her entire stay in that charming country.
Mr. Frazar continued to fail, antl after eight
years of heroic suffering died in 1896 in his
native State, Massachusetts.

In 1889 Mrs. Frazar started, as a regular

business, the managing ixiid conducting of
European parties. She says, "Experience
has shown me that Americans neetl to see
Europe carefully, particularly where the in-
fluence of things seen and studied shall be
for the benefit of our own country." In this
connection she encourages journalistic work
among her patrons, several of whom have
achieved therein great success. Rooks of de-
cided merit have grown out of this work.

The whole scheme of travel is carried out
as if planned for an individual. The growth
of her business has made assistance necessary,
and several young men of culture and travel
are now helping in it. The business is de-
cidedly educational, and through interest in
travel and the attending study of art and
literature Mrs. Frazar has accunmlated a
rich store of knowledge, which makes her
a most fascinating and instructive lecturer.
Appearing in this capacity before numerous
cluiis and societies, she has formed strong
friendships among club women, and has
become an active member of several clubs.
Two years ago she was elected president of
the Daughters of Maine Club of Somerville,
which is made up of four hundretl women
from the Pine Tree State, and whose work
is purely literary. This office she still holds.
At the present time she is on the editorial
staff of the National Magazine of lioston
and of the Somerville Journal, finding time
also to do much work for the Boston Tran-
script.

Mrs. Frazar dwells with much pleasure
on a certain incident in her life, which grew
out of her own stvirdy sense of justice. At
one time certain people came to this covmtry
from Italy to give addresses upon the political
conditions of that country. She felt that
gross misrepresentations were made, and came
out with a vigorous jjrotest, in the lioston
Transcript, correcting statements, and urging
that no country has the right to interfere with
what another country considers its depart-
ments of political justice. The Italians of
Boston appreciated this and gave a reception
to Mrs. Frazar, at which she was publicly
thanked for her generous sympathy, and
was presented with a tribute of flowers tied



with the Italian colors. These flowers were
the gift of one thousand Italians, each of
whon\ contributed one cent, this small sum
having been purposely fixed so that the ]ioorest
might share in the offering.

Mrs. Frazar has two sons: Gerard, the
commercial editor of the Globe, and Amherst
IXirell, who is connected with the Swift
Wool Company.

Whether pacing the deck of an Atlantic
steamer as one of her jiatrons, or interrupting
her at her editorial duties, or making known
to her some need of charity, one finds in Mrs.
Frazar a symjiathetic, genuine interest in
the welfare of others. Perhaps it is this
unselfishness that makes her so universally
beloved.



GRACE B. FAXON was born in Lynn,
Ma.ss., October 21, 1877. Daughter
of George and Mary Alice (Board-
man) Faxon, she is of the ninth gen-
eration of the Faxon family in New Eng-
land. Her paternal grandparents were George'
Faxon {James,"'' Richard,* Thomas,' Richard,^
Thomas'), born in 1796, and his wife Abigail,
daughter of William and Abigail (Newcomb)
Baxter and a descendant of John Alden. The
ancestral line is given below.

Ruth Alden (tlaughter of John and Pris-
cilla) married John Bass, Mary Bass married
Christopher Webb, Sarah Webb married Seth
Arnold, Mary Arnold married John Spear,
Prudence Spear married Daniel Ba.xter, and
was the mother of William Baxter and grand-
mother of Abigail.

Miss Faxon's maternal grandparents were
Israel Putnam Boardman and his wife Caro-
line Elizabeth, the former a son of Nathaniel
and Nancy (Putnam) Boardman. Israel Put-
nam, father of Nancy, was of the sixth genera-
tion of the family founded by John' Putnam,
of Salem Village, from whom he descended
through his son Nathaniel."

Mrs. Caroline ]&lt;]. Boardman's maiden name
was Gould. Daughter of Moses and Mehita-
ble (Upton) Gould, she was descended from
Zaccheus Gould, of Topsfield, and from John
Upton, fovmder of the New England family

of this name, also from Governor Endicott,
from the Rev. Samuel Skelton, and other early
colonists.

Seven of Miss Faxon's ancestors served in
the Revolutionary War, among them being
Captain Etlmund^ Ptitnam (father of Israel"
above named), who connnanded one of the
companies of militia that marched from Dan-
vers in response to the Lexington alarm of
April 19, 1775.

George" Faxon dying when his daughter
Grace was ten years of age, she went with her
widowed mother antl family to reside with
her maternal grandparents in Danvers, Mass.
Her schcjol life was but little prolonged be-
yond the early years of her girlhood. Miss
Faxon has, however, been a wide reader and
diligent home student. Prompted by a fond-
ness for the Bessie books, when only seven she
wrote a series of stories; at eight she had read
all of Dickens; and at sixteen she was teaching
a tlistrict school in which many of the pupils were
okler than she. She continued teaching for
four years, having charge of schools successively
in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
Possessed of a strong tlramatic temperament,
she early became interested in the stage as
a profession, and even while engaged in school-
teachmg she studied under Rachel Noah and
other leading teachers of dramatic art in Boston.
Taking part in amateur theatricals in &lt;lift'er-
ent parts of the country, she gained some rep-
utation as an actress, and later continued her
studies in New York. On account of family
opposition she finally relinquished the idea
of going on the stage, but frequently appeared
in lectures and readings.

At the age of twenty she turned her atten-
tion to writing for publication. Her first
ventures in this field took the form of short
stories for children and ailults. Afterward
she wrote for teachers' magazines, and in less
time than a year was called to New York City
to join the editorial staff of the New York
School Journal, for which she contributed freely
to every issue, writing on school-room sub-
jects and arranging many original school-room
entertainments. She resigned that [josition
to become editor-in-chief of Wer7ier's Maga-
zine. This monthly, devoted to the stage and



platform, she ably conducted for two years.
Going abroad in 1902, where she witnessed
the coronation ceremonies of King Edward
VII., she studied along such lines as would fit
her for writing upon and teaching dramatic
subjects. Miss Faxon has written a play for
the Daughters of the American Revolution, en-
titled "Maids and Matrons." She has been
prominent in New York City club life, belong-
ing to the New York Woman's Press Club,
the Professional Woman's League, Actors'
Church Alliance, Sunshine Society, and Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution.

Removing to Boston in the summer of 1903
to be near her family, she accepted the posi-
tion of literary atlviser in a Boston publish-
ing house, meanwhile contributing to that
city's dailies and weeklies. A few months
later she took the position of editor of the
Suburban, an illustrated weekly publication de-
signed for home reading, combining news and
social items with fiction and magazine features.
She has a keen interest in all that pertains to
the advancement of her sex, believing in equal
suffrage, antl her constant theme in writing is
"Woman's Loyalty to Woman."

In the Normal Instructor she conilucts a de-
partment of expression (the only one of its
kind), of the benefits of which teachers all
through the United States enthusiastically
speak. Miss Faxon is in religious affiliation
an ardent Unitarian.



CLARA BARTON, the first President
of the American National Red Cross,
was born in North Oxford, Ma.ss.,
December 25, 1S21, daughter of
Stephen and Sally (Stone) Barton. She was
named Clarissa Harlow. Her father, when
a young man, fought under General Anthony
Wayne in the Indian war in the West, and
was afterward a Captain of militia. His
parents were Dr. Stephen and Dorothy (Moore)
Barton, the former a son of Ednmnd Barton,
of Sutton, a sfjldier in the French war, and
the latter a &lt;laught('r of Elijah Moore, of
Oxford, and his wife, Dorothy Learned.

Clara Barton in girlhood pursued lier studies
under the tlirection of her older brothers and



296



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



sisters, she being the youngest of the family
of five. She learned something of business
methods by serving as book-keeper for her
brother Stephen, a majiufacturer. Adopting
at an early age the profession of teacher,
she taught school for several years in North
Oxford, and then attended the Clinton Liberal
Institute in Central New York, where she
studied the higher branches of learning. On
leaving the Institute she went with some
friends to New Jersey. In that State there
were then no public schools worthy the name.

At Bordentown she obtained permission
of the local authorities to open a free school.
The school began with six boys, others came
in, and soon her room was filled. Before
long the borough built a .school-house costing
four thousand dollars, and a little later the
free public school of Bordentown, with Miss
Barton at its head, had six hundred pupils
and eight teachers. On account of failing
health she at length resigned her position as
teacher and went to Washington to recuperate.
A few months later she became a clerk in the
Patent Office. This was in 1854. Losing
her ])Osition when Buchanan was President,
she regained it after the election of Lincoln.

Immediately upon hearing of the assault
on the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment at
Baltimore, she offered her services to the War
Department. Through her personal appeals
and active effort train-loads of supplies were
secured and forwarded ' to the front for the
soldiers in the field.

She visited the hospitals, and went with
the Army of the Potomac, ministering on the
battle-fields to the wounded. She personally
superintended the forwarding of supplies,
often riding on wagon trains many days and
nights, reaching the scenes of bloodshed in
time to minister to the wounded and dying.

Although her sensitive nature shrank from
these scenes of war, she continued her human-
itarian work in the thickest of the conflict.
She was in the siege of Charleston, and was
at Fort Wagner, Petersburg, and some of
the other most important fields of warfare.
Her ability, good judgment, ([uick perception,
and tireless energy were appreciated by sur-
geons, commanding generals, and the officials



at Washington; and every facility possible was
placed at her disposal by those in power, for
they realized that her services were invaluable.

At the close of the Civil War there were
eighty thousand missing men on the muster-
rolls of the United States. The work of
examining these rolls and locating the burial-
places of the fallen who were left on the field
was an undertaking that required skill, forti-
tude, and patience. Miss Barton, however,
was efjual to the task, and instituted the
" Bureau of Missing Men of the Armies of the
United States." This was a great comfort
to the anxious friends of martyred thousands,
whose records and names were secured and
placed on the official rolls at Washington.
Through her instrumentality stones were placed
over the graves of twelve thousand, nine hun-
dred and twenty soldiers at Andersonville
and tablets erected in memory of the four
hundred "Unknown."

Miss Barton continued this work four years,
expen(Ung fifteen thousantl dollars of her
own funds, for which she was reimbursed by
Congress.

In order to extend the interest in the returned
soldiers who had suffered for their country,
she often related at public gatherings stories
of her experiences on the field and in hospitals.

In 1869 she was advised by her physician
to visit Europe and take a much needed rest.
She intended leading a quiet life abroad three
years, but her fame had ])receded her. Ar-
riving in Geneva, Switzerland, in September,
1869, she was visited the following month
by the President and members of the "Inter-
national Conunittee for the Relief of the
Wounded in War," who desired her co-of)eration
in securing the adoption by the United States
of the treaty of the Red Cross.

The idea of forming permanent societies
for the relief of wounded sohUers originated
with Henri Dunant, a Swi.ss gentleman who
had been deeply impressed by the scenes
of suffering following tlie liattle of Solferino
in Jime, 1859. Lecturing in Geneva before
the "Society of Public LTtility," he interested
M. Gustave Moynier, its president. Dr. Ivouis
A])pin, and others. At a meeting of the
society held in February, 1863, the subject



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



297



was discussed, and a committee was formed,
with M. Moynier at its head, to take action.
In response to a circular issued by the commit-
tee some months later, there was held in Geneva
in October, 1863, an international conference
of thirty-six members, among them being
representatives of fourteen governments. The
conference lasted four days. Its proceed-
ings were marked by a "general unanimity,
as new as it was spontaneous, on a question
of humanity, instantaneously developed into
one of philanthropic urgency."

The result was the calling, by the conference,
of an international convention, which held
its sessions in Geneva in August, 1864. At
this convention was adopted a treaty consist-
ing of a code of ten articles, since known as
the Geneva Treaty, or tlie International Red
Cross Treaty, the sign or batlge agreed upon
being a red cross on white ground.

The first government to adopt the treaty
was that of France in September, 1864; the
eleventh. Great Britain in February, 1865;
the thirty-first, Peru in 1880. The formation
of national and of local societies of the Red
Cross followed in every case the adoption
of the treaty.

Miss Barton listened with deepest interest
to the account of the Red Cross movement
given to her by its leaders in Geneva, and,
as she says, was " impressed with the wisdom
of its principles and the good practical sense
of its details." During the Franco-Prussian
War she saw the excellent work done under
the Red Cross banner in the field — saw it
and took part in it, and resolved that she
would try to make the people of her native
country understand the Red Cross and the
treaty.

On her return to America in 1873, after
her exhausting labors in Strasburg, in Paris,
and at Metz, she having previously aided the
Duchess of Baden in establishing military
hospitals. Miss Barton was more in need of
rest than when she went abroad in 1869.
A period of invalidism and suffering followed.
Late in the year 1877 she was able to go to
Washington as the official bearer of a letter
from M. Moynier, president of the International
Committee of Geneva, to President Hayes,



urging the atloption by the United States
of the Geneva Treaty. The letter was kindly
received, but its appeal met with no response.
Writing newspaper articles and publishing
pamphlets. Miss Barton continued her ad-
vocacy of the cause until the coming in of
a new administration in March, 1881. She
then lost little time in presenting a copy of
M. Moynier 's letter to President Garfield,
whose interest and sympathy were expressed
a few weeks later in a letter of acknowledg-
ment written to Miss Barton by Secretary
Blaine.

Miss Barton now felt that it would be well
to anticipate and facilitate the desired action
of Congress by beginning to form societies.
A meeting that was held in Washington in
May, 1881, to further this end, resulted in
the formation of "The American Association
of the Reil Cross," of which Clara Barton was
made president. The first local society of
the Red Cross in the Ihiited States was formetl
at Dansville, N.Y., the country home of Miss
Barton, in August, 1881. The adhesion of
the United States to the Treaty of Geneva
was given on March 1, 1882, this nation being
the thirty-second to take such action and the
first to adopt the proposed amendment of
October, 1868, concerning the Red Cross for
the navy.

The American Association of the Red Cross,
it should be mentio^ied, was legally incorporated
in the District of- Columbia. A broader
scope was given to its humane work by the
adoption by the ratifying congress at Berne
of the '"American amendment,' whereby the
suffering incident to great floods, famines,
epidemics, conflagrations, cyclones, or other
disasters of national magnitude, may be
ameliorated by the administering of necessary
relief."

On April 17, 1893, was incorporated in the
District of Columbia, to continue the work
of the American Association above named,
"The American National Red Cross," to
constitute the Central National Committee
of the United States, authorized by the In-
ternational Committee of Geneva. The
American National Red Cross was reincor-
porated by Congress in 1900. Miss Barton



298



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



held the office of President till her retirement
in the spring of the present year (1904), when
she was succeeded by Mrs. John A. Logan.

From the beginning the American Red
Cross, so long under the efficient leadership
of Clara Barton, has been in active relief
work in times of national woe and calamity,
finding its duties in such occasions as (to
mention but a few) the forest fires of Michigan
in 1881; the Ohio and Mississippi floods of
1884; the Johnstown disaster, 1889: the Rus-
sian famine, 1891-92; the South Carolina
tidal wave, 1893; Armenian massacres, 1896;
anil later among the "reconcentrados" of
Cuba and in field and camj) and hospitals
during the Spanish-American War. The story
of these activities would fill volumes.

Referring to the work in Cuba, the Hon.
Retlfield Proctor, in a speech in the United
States Senate, March 17, 1898, said: "Miss
Barton antl her work need no endorsement
from me. I liad kjiown and esteemed her
for many years, but had not half appreciated
her capability and devotion to her work.
I especially looked into her business methods,
fearing there would be the greatest danger
of mistake, that there might be want of system,
waste, and extravagance, but found she could
teach me on these points. In short, I saw
nothing to criticise, but everything to com-
mend."

The following extract from the official
report of Lieutenant Colonel B. F. Pope,
Chief Surgeon, Fifth Army Corps, battles
of San Juan, El Caney, Santiago de Cuba,
is additional testimony to the invaluable
aid rendered by this distinguished woman:
" In Major Wood's hospital over one thousand
wounded men were received within three
days; and, in spite of lack of shelter and
the subsequent exposure to intense heat and
drenching rains, the mortality rate was less
than seven per cent. . . . Early after the battle
the hospital was honored by the presence
of Miss Clara Barton and her staff of four
assistants, who immediately set up their
tents and cooking apparatus, and labored
incessantly, day and night, in the broiling
sun and drenching rain, preparing sick food
for the wountled and serving it to them, and



in a thousand other ways giving the help that
the Red Cross Society brings."

In his message to Congress, December 5,
1898, President McKinley .said: "In this con-
nection it is a pleasure for me to mention
in terms of cordial appreciation the timely
and useful work of the American National
Red Cross, both in relief measures preparatory
to the cam]3aigns, in sanitary assistance at
several of the camps of assemblage, and later,
imder the able and experienced leadership
of the Presi&lt;lent of the society, Miss Clara
Barton, on the fields of battle and in the
hospitals at the front in Cuba. W'orking in
conjunction with the governmental authorities
and under their sanction and approval and
with the enthusiastic co-operation of many
patriotic women and societies in the various
States, the Red Cross has fully maintained
its alreatly high reputation for intense earnest-
ness and abifity to exercise the noble purposes
of this international organization, tluis justify-
ing the confitlence and support which it has
received at the hands of American people.
To the members and officers of this society
and all who aided them in philanthropic
work the sincere and lasting gratitude of the
sokliers and the public is due anil is freely
accorded."

It is estimated that the value of relief ex-
tended under the direction of Miss Barton
as president of the American Red Cross was
nearly three million dollars. She represented
the United States at several international
conferences of the Red Cross in Europe.

Miss Barton is a cjuiet, unassuming woman
in appearance, and never boasts of her achieve-
ments. She is dignified in manner, self-
possessed, and a tireless worker. Among the
numerous decorations she has received in
recognition of her meritorious services may
be mentioned the Iron Cross of Prussia, a
badge of rare distinction, and the Golden
Cross of Baden.

In 1883 Miss Barton served as Superintendent
of the Reformatory Prison for Women in
Sherborn, Mass. While she has had but
little time to devote to other work than that
of the Red Cross, she is deeply interested
in the Grand Army of the Republic and the

Woman's Relief Corps, the only recognized
auxiliary to the G. A. R. She is a Past National
Chaplain of the National Woman's Relief
Corps anil its only honorary member. She
is often an honored guest at the annual gather-
ings of these national organizations, and
has a warm place in the hearts of tlieir members.
For several years Miss Barton resided in
the mansion in Washington formerly occupied
by General Grant as his headquarters. During
the past few years she has made her home
at Glen Echo, Md.



SALOME MERRITT, M.D., daughter of
the late Increase Sunmer and Susan
(Penniman) Merritt, was born Febru-
ary 22, 1843, in Templeton, Mass. She
was the youngest of eleven children, seven of
whom are now living. Her father was of the
Scituate family founded by Henry' Merritt,
whose name appears in the Plymouth Colony
records as grantor of a deed in 1628. Her
mother was a descendant of James Penniman,
of Braintree, Mass., and his wife Lydia, who
was a sister of John Eliot, the Apostle to the
Intlians.

The Merritt household was a cheerful, happy
one, unclouded by stern discipline, the youth-
ful gayety of the children heartil)' encouraged
by their parents. Salome was a wide-awake,
lively girl, very fond of pets, making play-
fellows of the domestic animals. At school
she was bright and quick to master difficult
tasks. Having completed the courses provided
in the district school and high school, she taught
for a few terms. After that she continued her
education at the seminary in East Greenwich,
R.L, graduating in 1864, the valedictorian of
her class.

For the next seven years she was a success-
ful teacher; but longing for a broader field of
activity, a vocation which should be of greater
benefit to others, she decided to adopt the
profession of metlicine, an undertaking attended
in those days with many difficulties, not the
least of which was public disfavor. Conse-
quently her sister, who throughout life was
her devoted companion, sharing all her hard-
ships and successes, tried to dissuade her, but



without avail. Her resolution taken, she en-
tered the Boston Female Medical College. This
college soon passing into control of Boston Uni-
versity anil changing from the old to the homcoo-
pathic school, she entered the New York Free
Medical College for Women, from which she
was graduated in 1874, having completed in
one year the work usually assigned for a three
years' course. Upon the resignation of the
noted Dr. J. V. C. Smith, profe.ssor of anatomy,
Dr. Merritt was upon his recommendation ap-
pointed to fill the vacancy. For two years she
remained in this responsible position, proving
fully the wisdom of the choice; but, longing
for the busy, useful life of an active practice,
she came to Boston, and established herself at
59 Hancock Street, where she remained until
1896.

Meantime numerous other claims demanded
a part of her time. She was a born sufTragist,
and worked perseveringly to advance the cause
in all directions, national, State, and mu-
nicipal. She originated and secured several
amendments to the statutes of assessment and
registration by which school suffrage was made
easier. She was a charter member of the
National Woman Suffrage Association, was its
president in 1893, and from the start always
gave her earnest support and unfailing interest
to all its measures.

As a voter in Ward Ten, Boston, she was
active in all matters concerning the welfare of
the public schools, and diil much to arouse the
interest of other women. As a member of the
original W^ard and City Committee of Women
Voters, her influence and exertions were di-
rected toward securing the election of the best
women and men to the school board, thus mak-
ing it a greater ])ower for good. This was a
matter of vital importance to her, and she de-
voted to it much of her time and strength.
\Mien, in 1888, the anti-Catholic question in
the management of the public schools arose,
Dr. Merritt took a firm stand against the meas-
ure as unconstitutional and un-American. A
year later, when the Citizens' Public School
LTnion w;is formed, she was made its president.
This organization was a potent factor in pre-
venting the board from being made an entirely
Protestant body.

She was one of the founders and for many
years vice-president of the Moral Education
Association, one of whose aims was to create
an interest in tlie subject of physiological in-
struction in the high schools. She presided
over a meeting held in one of the halls of Bos-
ton, in which the subject was discussed by a
goodly number of earnest, thoughtful men and
women, wlio had come to realize its need. It
was a great .satisfaction to her, near the close
of her life, to know that the movement had
gained steadily in favor, nmch having been
done to advance the cause, especially in pro-
viding suitable literature and giving lectures.

When the Hospital Board of the Woman's
Charity Club was ff)rmed, she became an ac-
tive member, always ready to give from her
experience thoughts and suggestions of value
in this new field of woman's work.

In 188!) she was the originator of the idea
that led to the institution of the Connnittee
of Counsel and Co-operation, composed of dele-
gates from many large organizations. Of this
"C. C. C." she was chairman, and planned
several of the reforms which it brought about.
Some of tlie beneficial results of their labors
are the reform in the management of the public
institutions of ]3oston and the appointment of
.women on prison and charitable boards. They
have worked for shorter hours in mercantile
establishments and for other measures in behalf
of working-women. Along the line of moral
reform they have made persistent and success-
ful efforts. They were also instrumental in
checking the practice of spitting in the public
cars, which by the Board of Health is now made
punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars.
For several years their attention has been
given to the subject of pui)lic anuisements,
effecting the removal of several obscene and
demoralizing exhibits. This, watchfulness is
a healthy restraint on the managers of these
places, and has effected a decided improve-
ment in the character of the displays.

As president of the Ladies' Physiological In-
stitute her work was broad and fur-reaching.
She strove to eliminate from her teaching all
obscure technicalities and make her lectures
plain, practical, and so interesting as to hold
the attention of the members who came each



week from far ami near. She was leader, in-
structor, fellow-worker, and personal friend;
and many are the mothers whose children reap
the benefit of her wise teachings.

She was also prominent in the movement in-
augurated by Mrs. Alice N. Lincoln for a re-
form in the public institutions of Boston, which
resulted in the appointment in 1892, by Mayor
Matthews, of a Board of Visitors, "to be," as
he wisely expressed it, "eyes and ears for him."
Hearings Aveie held before the Conmiittee on
Public Institutions, and few who listened to hei'
will ever forget Dr. Merritt's eloquent plea in
behalf of this measure. Another Board of
^^isitors was iijipointed in 1894. After further
hearings a committee of three, of which Dr.
Mcrritt was one, )3rescnted a bill, endorsed by
Mayor Quincy, asking that the public institu-
tions of Boston be divided, and that separate
departments be established for the care ot
prisoners, paupers, children, antl insane per-
sons. Each dcjiartment was to have a Board
of Trustees, composed of lioth men and women.
/This measure became a law in 1897, after a
bitter contest. In this work, from its incipiency
to the enactment of the law. Dr. Merritt was
instrumental in enlisting public sentiment and
assistance.

Notwithstanding all these varied interests
she was ha|)piest, best known, and best be-
loved in her own honie. Sisters and brothers,
nieces and nephews, all turned to her for ad-
vice, sure of a loving sympathy in all that con-
cerned them.

It is impo.ssible in so short a sketch to do
justice to her many-sided character. She loved
every bieathing creature; and many a forlorn,
neglected animal in her neighborhood has she
liefriended. Babies were her especial care, and
her interest did not cease with the need for
medical attention. Her heart went out to the
poor, and many were the sick and needy who
were gladdened by receiving the doctor's bill
receipted, sometimes followed by donations of
food and clothing. When the holidays were
near, the Merritt kitchen was a busy place,
and various were the dishes of good whole-
some food, prepared often by tired hands, that
were carried late at night to households where
such dainties had been hitherto unknown. It

was onlj' when some friend whose calls pene-
trated to all parts of the house discovered the
workers at their tasks that these benefactions
became known; for one of the watchwords of
that household was, "Let not thy left hantl
know what thy right hand doeth."

Dr. Merritt's original and independent habit
of thought on all subjects could not fail to
evince itself in her religious belief. Without
seeking opportunities, she did not shrink from
ex|iressing her own individual persuasion when
conversing with jjcrsons of a different faith.
Her love of truth could not abide the obvious
jjievarications of those who believe in the
evangelical doctrines, yet live in utter disre-
garil for the welfare of others, apparently only
desirous to benefit self. Many have heard her
tjuote the memorable words of Thomas Paine,
"The work! is my country, to do good is my
religion." 80 well was this known that the
Ladies' Physiological Institute, of which she
was jiresident, in selecting for her a birthday
gift, chose an exquisite little statue of Paine,
which she prized more highly than she could
have ilone some more costly token of ordinary
senthnent.

At one time, perhaps in the eighties, the
opportunity came for Dr. Merritt to witness in
her own house some of the then unusual {ihe-
nomena of sj)irit power, and her interest was
arouseil to make a study. of this belief. All
went well until one evening she was called
away. On her return, being told of the ful-
filment of a promise that "something more
wonderful than before would be given when
the conditions were all favorable," she im-
pulsiveh' exclaimed, "I don't believe it"; and
for several years utterly re])udiated all her
former conclusions. Afterward, however, she
felt that it had been a mistake to throw away
such opportunity, and asked a friend, when
they were about to i)art for the sunmier, to
keep her in mind and write to her if she had any
message.

In her earlier days she was called an atheist,
but she disavowed this charge by referring
to another state of existence, and in her last
illness, speaking of the hereafter, said, " There'll
be work for me to do there." She died Novem-
ber 7, 1900. Premature as her transition



seemed, Dr. Merritt, if we can judge by the good
accomplished and the amount of her un-
selfish labor for the benefit of others, had
roundetl out a long life.



MARGARET HAMILTON, past presi-
dent of the National Army Nurse
Association, is one of the heroines
of the Civil War whose recoril
deserves a place in its history. Her experi-
ence as an army nurse was in her early woman-
hood, when she bore her maiden name, Mar-
garet Mahoney. She was marrietl in Phila-
delphia in November, 1864, to Charles Roberts
Hamilton, a soldier of the Nineteenth Maine
A'olunteers, whom she had first met while she
was on duty in the Satterlee Hospital.

Born October 19, 1840, in Rochester,
N.Y., Mrs. Hamilton is the only chikl of the
late Cornelius and Mary (Sheehan) Mahoney.
Her paternal grandparents were Dennis Ma-
honey and his wife Margaret, for whom she
was named. 'She was educated in the public
schools and St. Joseph's Seminary at Ennnits-
burg, Md. Here she joined the order of Sis-
ters of Charity, going through the novitiate,
and was sent by them to teach at St. Joseph's
Asylum at Albany, N.Y., where she remained
for a year and a half. She was with the sis-
ters four years; but, before it was time to take
the vows (which is done in the fifth year),
she found that she hail no vocation for that
life, and left the order, but with respect for it
and the best of feeling for those with whom she
had been associateil.

Early in the spring of 1862 an ortler came
from the Mother House for three other nurses
ami herself to go to the Satterlee United States
Military Hospital in West Philadelphia. Dr.
Isaac I. Hayes, the Arctic explorer, was the
surgeon in charge, being assistetl by Dr. James
Williams, Dr. John S. Billings, and others. The
hospital was built to accommodate five thousand
patients, and was opened May 1, 1862.

Referring to her experiences, Mrs. Hamilton
says: "We fared poorly for some time, as the
commissary department had not been estab-
lished nor the necessary conveniences for work
supplied. A day or two later hundreds of



302

our brave boys arrived from the Chickahoni-
iny swamps. The ward surgeons, metUcal
cadets, and the commissary department arrived
with them. Now the real work of hospital
life began in earnest. The first week after
the arrival of these wounded and fever-stricken
boys we had scarcely time to eat, rest, or sleep.
During the battles that followed in 1S62, 1863,
and 1864 our hospital was constantly filled.
From the battle-field of Gettysburg more
soldiers were received than ever before. The
wards were overcrowded, and tents were
erected on the grounds to accommodate two
thousand. The most of these were colored
troops, who, when convalescent, made it
lively with camp-meeting hymns, which
greatly amused some of the boys. The
weather was extremely warm, and the vast
number of the wounded made careful attention
to their wounds impossible. Upon the arrival
of the men at the hospital many of the wounds
were full of vermin, and in numerous cases
gangrene had set in. The odor was almost
unbearable. So increased was ' the demand
on our time and labor that the number of
nurses seemed utterly inadequate, and the
hospital presented a true picture of the horrors
of war. Amid such scenes of dreadful suffer-
ing, borne so uncomplainingly, my life as
an army nunse was passed. Yet it is with
feelings of thankfulness to God that I recall
those times, and know that I was permitted
to give almost three years of the best of my
life to the country I love and to its brave
defenders."

Mrs. Hamilton was one of those who vol-
unteered to nurse the soldiers stricken with
small-pox, which meant isolation from all
but the patients. Sister Mary Xavier, a loyal,
loving nurse, who was associated with her in
the j)est department, died while in the per-
formance of these duties. After the battle
of th(&gt; Wilderness in the summer of 1864,
small-pox again visited this hospital, and
Mrs. Hamilton once more occupied the post
of danger in caring for the patients. In No-
vember, 1864, on account of failing health,
she was obliged to leave the hospital, her
inability to continue in the service being a
great disappointment to her.



Mrs. Hamilton's interest in the men who
saved the Union will never cease. The re-
unions and other celebrations connected with
the national encampments of the Grand Army
of the Republic are occasions of great enjoy-
ment, whenever she has the privilege of attend-
ing them. She has been elected chaplain of
the H. M. W^arren Relief Corps of Wakefiekl,
Mass., several years in succession, and is
highly esteemed by the comrades of the post
to which this corps is auxiliary.

When the Army Nurse Association of Massa-
chusetts was organized, in 1892, Mrs. Hamilton
was chosen secretary, and has continued in
the office. She was president of the National
Army Nurse Association, having been elected
at its annual meeting in Washington, D.C.,
in 1902. She is a member of the Ladies' Ai(l
Association of the Massachusetts Soldiers'
Home, and often visits this home in Chelsea.

She is a member of the First Baptist Church
of Wakefield.

Eight children, two sons and six daughters,
were the fruit of the union of Margaret antl
Charles Roberts Hamilton. The eldest child,
Charles West, died February 10, 1869, in Phila-
delphia. The other son, George Gordon, died
February 22, 1901, aged twenty-four years.
Six children are living, namely — Anna May,
Margaret Esther, Blanche Roberts, Charlotte
Douglas, Lucy Belle, antl Ruth Florence. Anna
May Hamilton was born in Philadelphia, and
was five years old when her parents came to
Massachu-setts. She was graduated from Welles-
ley College in the cla.ss of 1890. She is professor
of Latin in the Penn.sylvania College for Women
at Pittsburg, and ranks high as a teacher. In
1902, having been granted a year's leave
of ab.sence, she enjoyed a trip to Europe.
Margaret and Charlotte Hamilton also attended
Wellesley College. Blanche, Lucy, and Ruth
ar(&gt; graduates of the Wakefield High School.

Charles Roberts Hamilton, the father,
served in the army from August, 1862, until
December, 1864. He died April 9, 1900. On
the paternal side he was of Scottish extrac-
tion, belonging to the Hamilton family of
Berwick, Me. The following account of his
lineal ancestors has been compiled partly from
the manuscript of the Rev. Arthur Wcntworth



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



303



Eaton Hamilton and partly from the notes
copied from original records.

David Hamilton, a Scotch pris(jiier after
the battle of Worcester, in September, 1651,
was one of the passengers on the ship " John
and Sarah," November S, 1651, sailing from
Gravesend, England, to New England.

The Rev. Arthur W. H. Eaton says: "David
Hamilton was undoubtedly born in Scotland,
and most likely belonged to the Westburn
Hamiltons. This, I think, is almost certain,
since he named one of his sons Gabriel, a
name which never occurs in Scotland, so far
as I know, except in the Westburn family. . . .
Westburn is in the barony and jxu-ish of
Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland. William
Hamilton, of Wishaw, wrote in 1710: ' Westburn
was lately fewed out by the Duchess of Hamil-
ton to Hamilton of Westburn. It is a pleasant
house upon the river with good gardens.'"

The Westburn Hamiltons were an old and
distinguished branch of the family of the Duke
of Hamilton, having sprung from Thomas of
Darngabar, third son of the first Duke of
Hamilton. (Burke's "Landed Gentry.")

David Hamilton married at Saco, Me., in
1662, Anna Jackson. From the journal of
the Rev. John Pike it is learned that David
Hamilton and others were killed by the Ind-
ians at Newichwannock (Berwick), September
28, 1691. His sons were: David, Solomon,
Gabriel, Jonathan, Abel, Jonas, Abiel, James.

Abiel Hamilton was born probal)ly about
16SU, but whether in Kittery or Dover has
not been ascertained. As shown by the Ber-
wick town records and York Deeds, he owned
nuich land in Kittery, possessing large tracts
situated on both sides of Salmon Falls, on
Little River, near Love's Brook, ami near
Doughty's Falls. He received two pounds,
ten shillings, February 9, 1712, "for going
ex])ress to Boston last fall and ye service of
ye parish." He was grand juryman March
15, 1713-4; constable, DecembcT 23, 1717;
and petit juryman, June 16, 1718.

Records of the First Church of Berwick
give the following: " Bial Hamilton, member
May 24, 1719; dismissed to Upper Church."
On the parish rate, Berwick, September 29,
1752, he is taxed fifteen shillings, ten pence.



Abiel' Hamilton married Abigail Hodgdon,
December 26, 1721, she being his second
or thinl wife. He had about fifteen children,
one of whom, and the next in this line of
descent, was named Solomon. Abiel Ham-
ilton died between March 9, 1758, the date
of his will, and January 31, 1763, when it
was proved. He devises to wife Abigail one
half of the homestead during her life; to sons
Jonas and Solomon, the homestead, house,
barn, orchard, and so forth.

Solomon Hamilton, son of Abiel and Al)i-
gail, was baptized August 19, 1733, at the
First Church in Berwick. He married twice,
and was survivetl by his second wife, Eliza-
beth Pearce. Previous to March 23, 1778,
they signed a deed to Joseph Chadbourne, Jr.,
of land in Scjuth Berwick, near Love's Brook,
on the roatl to Doughty's Falls. S(jlomon
Hamilton died between April 9 and June 24,
1794. In his will he gave to his wife Eliza-
beth, whom he made executrix, the improve-
ment of all his estate in Berwick during her
natural life, and directed that his son Daniel,
the seventh of his eight children, should re-
ceive five pounds, five shillings, on arriving
at the age of twenty-one.

Daniel Hamilton, son of Solomon and Eliza-
beth (Pearce) Hamilton, of Berwick, was born
April 21, 1785. He followed the sea exten-
sively for his occupation, anil he served his
country in the War of 1812, participating in
the engagement at Lundy's Lane. He married
in Belfast, Me., Esther Roberts, grand-daughter
of Joseph Roberts, who served four years in
the Revolutionary War. Daniel Hamilton
was the first settler in Swanville, Me. He
died in that town, December 8, 1872, aged
eighty-seven years, eight months.

In 1817 Daniel Hamilton, then of Belfast,
appointed Jacob Hamilton, of Berwick, " my
lawful attorney to take care of and manage
all such real estate as belongs to me in the
said town of Berwick which descends to me
from my late father, Solomon Hamilton, of
Berwick, deceased." The late Charles Roberts
Hamilton was the youngest of the thirteen
children born to Daniel and Esther (Roberts)
Hamilton, of Belfast and later of Swan-
ville, Me.

but became a Republican upon the organ-
ization of that party, and voted its ticket
the remainder of his hfe. When a young
man he became a Univcrsahst, being the first
of his family to embrace that religious faith,
which was tar from popular. He was a very
zealous believer, and had a wide acquaintance
with the leaders of Universalism, among them
being the Rev. Thomas Whittemore, editor
of the Trumpet and U niversalist Magazine,
who was a frequent visitor to his home. Mr.
Elliot was one of the first members of the
First Universalist Church in Somerville.

He was devoted to his home and family

Indian wars; and a relative, Zachariah Robbins,
serve&lt;l throughout the Revolution, a part of
the time in the army and part in tlie navy.



Joseph and Zenora (Tucker) Elliot had
three children — Charles Darwin, Alfred Law-
rence, antl Mary E. Mrs. Elliot was a woman
of progressive ideas antl of literary talent.
Several of her poems have been published.
She was active in church and philanthropic
movements and a liighly esteemed member
of several organizations. Her death occurred
October 25, 1885, while she was on a visit
to the home of her girlhood in Mount
Holly, Vt.

Mary E. Elliot began writing for the press
in 1867, and has published numerous articles
and reports. From 1867 to 1885 she was
active in temperance work, giving addresses
in many places in Massachusetts and having
a wide acquaintance with workers in the
cause in other States. She inherited a love
for patriotic principles, and, when invited
to assist in organizing a Relief Corps in
Somerville, readily accepted. This corps was
formed in 1878 as an auxiliary to Willard C.
Kinsley Post, No. 139, G. A. R., and was one
of the first societies of the kind organized in
the country on the basis of ritualistic work.
She prejjaretl the ritual under which its
meetings were conducted, and was its presi-
dent three years. This was a so-called in-
dependent organization, conducting its work
on local lines only, until May, 1892, when
it united with the De]jartment of Massachu-
setts, and was reorganized on a broader basis.
It was instituted May 11, 1882, as Relief
Corps No. 21, and has ever since been con-
nected with the State organization, being
one of the leading cori)s among the one hun-
dred an&lt;l .seventy-four of the State.

Miss Elliot was president of this corps
nearly two years and secretary one year.
In June, 1885, she was appointed by Mrs.
M. Susan Goodale, Department President,
to the office of Department Secretary, to fill
a vacancy caused by the resignation of Mrs.
Sarah E. Fuller, who had been elected National
President of the order at IV)rtland, Me.

Miss Elliot has held the position of Depart-
ment vSecretary for nineteen years, having
lieen ann\ially reappointed by the succeeding
Department Presidents. There being one
hundred and seventy-four subordinate corps

and over fourteen thousand members, her
office is one of great responsibihty.

She has participated in all the National
Conventions since 1883, and in the perform-
ance of this duty has travelled in nearly all
the States and Territories of the Union. In
1895 she was chairman of a committee to
compile a history of the Department of Massa-
chusetts, Woman's Relief Cori)s, a volume
of four hundred pages.

Miss Elliot has delivered Memorial Day
addresses in Massachusetts and New Hamp-
shire by invitation of Grand Army posts,
and has participated in several hundred
patriotic gatherings. She is chairman of the
Press Committee for the National Convention
in Boston (1904), a position she hekl during
the arrangements for the National Conven-
tion in Boston in 1890, and is also a member
of the Executive Committee, Entertainment
and other committees for that great gathering.
She was recently presented a valuable gold
watch and chain set with diamonds, a testi-
monial from members throughout the State,
and her friends have also presented her por-
trait to department heatlquarters in the
Boylston Building.

For nearly twenty years she has been a
regular contributor to the military depart-
ment of the Boston Globe, and has written
extensively upon woman's patriotic efforts.
She has in preparation a book giving his-
torical and biographical data concerning the
men in whose honor the posts of the Grand
Army of the Republic are named. When
published, it will be unique in character,
as no such work has ever been issued in any
State.

Miss Elliot is an officer of the Ladies' Aid
Association of the Soldiers' Home in Massa-
chusetts, and her name is on its first roll of
membership. She is also a charter member
of Bunker Hill Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution, a member of the Som-
erville Historical Society, of tiie New I'nglnnd
Historic-Genealogical Society, and of other
organizations. She takes a special interest
in histdrical matters. She is liberal in her
religious belief, being a Universalist.

Her brother, Charles Darwin Elliot, served



in the Civil War on the staff of engineers
in tlie Nineteenth Army Corps, under General
Banks, and was in the Port Hudson cam-
paigns, the Red River expedition, serving
also in Texas and in other campaigns. He
was the first city engineer of Somerville, and
for three years was president of the Historical
Society of that city.

Miss Elliot is one of the compilers of " Rep-
resentative Women oi New England."

Aid Society" of that city in the Civil
War, was born November 23, 1843, in Union,
Rock County, Wis. Her parents, David, Jr.,
and Mary (Sjiencer) Ring, removed from Max-
field, Me., to Perkins Grove, 111., and thence to
Wisconsin about 1839 or 1840.

David Ring, Jr., Mrs. Elliot's father, was a
son of David Ring (born March 3, 1769) and
his wife, Mehital)le Crockett (born August 26,
1769), and grandson of John Crockett (born
August 14, 1738) and his wife, Mary Starbird,
who was born January 19, 1745. David Ring,
Jr., was born in Sumner, Me., A]jril 7, 1801, died
in Wisconsui in June, 1874. He married June
24, 1824, Mary, daughter of John and Mary
(Urann) Spencer. She was born in Bangor, Me.,
in 1806, and died in Wisccm.sin, October 13, 1846.
They had nine children, six of whom were born
in Maine, one in Illinois, and two in Wi-sconsin.
Their eighth child was Emily J., the subject of
this sketch.

Through her maternal grandmother Mrs.
Elliot is a descendant of Captain Thomas
. Ih-ann, one of the Boston Tea Party and an
officer of the American Revolution. He served
at the battle of Bunker Hill in the regiment of
Colonel Richard Gridley and later under General
William Heath, 1777 to 1779. Captain Urann
was one of the "Sons of Lil)erty " and a member
of the "North End Caucus," a patriotic a.sso-
ciation whose membership included Paul Revere,
John and Samuel Adams, and General Josejjh
Warren. He was also a member and for some
time Master of St. Andrews Lodge of Free
Masons, and one of the organizers and first

officers of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts.
He was a son of Joseph and Sarah (Jamison)
Urann, was born in Boston, February 3, 1723,
and married April 3, 1751, Mary Sloper, of
Boston. They had seven sons and six daugh-
ters. Their son Joseph, born June 11, 1753,
married Hannah Emmes, of Boston, July 28,
1776, and was the father of Mary Llrann, bap-
tized December 14, 1777, who wJis married
February 16, 1795, in the Brattle Street Church,
by the Rev. Peter Thatcher, to John Spencer,
of Boston. Mr. Spencer died in 1816; and in
1818 his widow became the second wife of
David Ring, Sr., of Bangor, Me., whose son,
David, Jr., married, as above noted, her daugh-
ter, Mary Spencer. Another of Mrs. Elliot's
ancestors was Jonas Clark, " the famous Ruling
Elder of the Cambridge Church."

After the death of lier mother Emily J. Ring
became, by act of Legislature, the adopted
daughter of the Hon. Nathaniel F. Hyer,
Judge of Probate, one of the founders of the
State of Wisconsin and a member of its Con-
stitutional Convention. An extended sketch
of Mr. Hyer is contained in the " Memorial
Record of the Fathers of Wisconsin," published
in ISSO. He was a native of Vermont. Receiv-
ing a collegiate education, he was admitted to
the bar and became a prosperous lawyer. In

1836, his health failing, lie emigrated to the
wilds of Wisconsin, locating in Milwaukee.
Soon afterward we find him engaged in various
exploring expeditions, in one of which, after
following an Indian trail for forty miles, he
came upon curious and extensive prehistoric
mounds and works, which he believed to be
the site of an ancient Aztec settlement. Here
Mr. Hyer founded a new town which he called
Aztalan, which name it still bears. In January,

1837, he surveyed and mapped the.se old ruins,
publishing an interesting description of them,
which was copied into Silliman's and other
journals. They also became the subject of
an interesting correspondence between Mr.
Hyer and the Hon. Edward Everett. Mr.
Hyer's discovery and accoimt of these remains
is mentioned in the elaborate work of the Smith-
sonian Institution on Wisconsin Antiquities
as being "the foimdation of all subsecpient
plans and descriptions."



In 1849 Mr. Hyer, by ill health compelled to
seek a wanner climate, removed with his family
to St. Louis, where for several years he was
County Surveyor. In 1856 they went to San
Antonio, Tex., and in May, 1857, crossed the
Texas prairies in Mexican ox-carts to the coast,
where they eml)arked for New Orleans and
thence went to Pensacola, Fla. In September,
1857, they removetl to Louisiana. Mr. Hyer
was there engaged in surveys of the levees and
of swamp lancls, the family in the meantime
living sometimes in New Orleans, sometimes
in the country. The opening of the Civil War
found them in their country home, cut off
from New Orleans, and surrounded by Con-
federate troops and sympathizers, among whom
Mr. Hyer, being an outspoken LInionist, was
a marked man. His knowledge of the country
made him a dangerous person for the ('onfed-
eracy should he reach the Federal lines, and a
plot was therefore laid to kill him; but, fore-
warned and aided by personal friends among
the Confederates, he escaped with his family
by bribing the rebel guard. Secreted in the
hold of a little schooner, they made their way
safely across Lake Pontchartrain, reaching the
Union lines at New Orleans in October, 1862.

Mr. Hyer was immediately appointed by
General Butler upon his staff of assistant engi-
neers, serving until the close of the war. He
furnished many plans and a large amount of
data concerning the roads, rivers, and topog-
raphy of Louisiana, also other information of
an important military character, to the Unicm
army. After the war he was appointed Col-
lector of United States land tax, later LTnited
States Register of Voters, and afterward Parish
Treasurer and Survej'or. In 1877 he returned
from Louisiana to Wisconsin, where he died
September 12, 1885.

In 1S40 Mr. Hyer married Frances Elizabeth,
daughter of Caleb and Nancy (Ruggles) Clapp
and a descendant of the old Boston and Rox-
bury Clapp, Dorr, and Ruggles families. Mrs.
Hyer was born in Vermont, her father having re-
moved to that State and become an ini]iorter
of merino sheep and a wool raiser and man-
ufacturer. After his death his family mi-
grated to Wisconsin. Mrs. Hyer was educated
at Madam Seaton's Seminary. Much of her



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



309



early life was spent with her kinsfolk in Boston.
She was a woman of brilliant intellect and char-
itable and progressive ideas, antl a valued con-
tributor to periodical publications. In the
soldiers' relief work in New Orleans, in which
she was ])roniinent during the war and after
it, she passed through many scenes of excite-
ment and horror. In 1864 she made a voyage
up the Mississijjpi River on the steamer " Em-
press," which was attacked by masked bat-
teries, riddled with cannon shot, and disabled,
the captain and several convalescent soldiers
being killed, and the steamer only saved from
falling into the hands of the Confederates by
the arrival of the Unitetl States gunboat
"Kineo." Mrs. Hyer died in Wisconsin in De-
cember, 1SS8.

Among Mrs. Elliot's many thrilling experi-
ences while in Texas was the raiding by Indians
of a camp near where she was visiting, all the
horses and cattle being stampeded.

Shortly after their arrival in New Orleans
in the autunm of 1S62 Mrs. Hyer, Mrs. N. M.
Taylor, Mrs. Elliot (then Miss Hyer), and other
Union ladies of the city, at the suggestion of
prominent Union men, organized the " Union
Ladies' Sokliers' Aid Society," afterward called
the "Union Ladies' Aid As.sociation," which
attained a membershi|) of more than hfty of
the loyal women of the city. Mrs. Hyer was
elected president, Mrs. Taylor vice-president,
and Mrs. Elliot secretary. The members of
this society visited the hospitals and admin-
isteretl to sick and wounded sfildiers, provid-
ing them with lint, bandages, and other neces-
sities and comforts. Among workers promi-
nent in Ihis society were Mrs. N. M. "^Taylor,
previously mentioned, who, though a strong
Unionist, had a son conscripted into the Con-
federate army; Mrs. Phoebe Farmer, the poet;
Miss Kate Buckley, a teacher in the New Or-
leans schools; Mrs. Dr. Kirchner; Mrs. and
Miss Bai'nett; and others whose names are
among the recognized women workers of the
Civil War. Their badge was a miniature Union
flag. This society published a little paper.
The Acorn, with Mrs. Hyer and Mrs. Taylor as
editors, devoted to the cause of Unionism in
Louisiana. This paper received the approval
and became one of the official organs of the



conuuanding general of the Department, and
in it were published the official orders of the
Army of the Gulf. Mrs. Elliot was a contrib-
utor to this paper. The members of the soci-
ety received from army surgeons instructions
in their chosen duties. They also held public
meetings in Lyceum Hall weekly, and on other
evenings at private houses.

The Unionists of New Orleans formed a so-
cial conununity of their own, and, by assemblies,
receptions, and a cordial welcome to their homes,
made the life of the Union officers and men in
New Orleans more endurable and pleasant than
it would otherwise have been.

The loyal men of New Orleans also formed
an association in the interest of the Union
cau.se, many officers of the army lu-ing members,
among them Mr. Hyer and Mr. Elliot, both offi-
cers of the Association'. Dr. A. P. Dostie, an
outspoken Unionist antl a martyr of the New
Orleans anti-Union riot of 1866, was a promi-
nent officer of this and other loyal societies.

Soon after her escape to the Union lines in
1862 Mrs. Elliot, who had been a teacher in
the parish schools of Louisiana, was ai)pointed
ttrst assistant in one of the gnunmar schools
of New Orleans, which had been reorganized
by General liutler. She held this position until
after her marriage, September 3, 1863, to
Charles Darwin Elliot, of Massachusetts, As-
sistant Topographical Engineer of the Army of
the Gulf.

Mr. Elliot is a descendant of Thomas Eliot,
of Swansea, Mass., a soldier of King Philip's
War. His great-grandfather, Joseph Eliot, of
Stoughton, was a minute-man of the Revolu-
tion, serving from April 20, 1775, until his
death, December 15, 1777. Another ancestor,
John Hicks, was a member of the Boston Tea
Party, and was killed in the battle of Lexing-
ton. The home of a third, Stephen Tucker,
Jr., was destroyed by the burning of Charle.'^-
town.

Mr. Elliot, son of Joseph and Zenora (Tucker)
Elliot,' was born June 20, 1S37, in Foxboro,
Mass. He received his education in the schools
of Foxboro, Maiden, A\'rentham, and Somer-
ville, and at the Hopkins Classical School,
Cambridge. He studied civil engineering in
the office of W. B. Stearns, wIkj was later presi-



310

dent, of the Fitchburg Railroad. Appointeil by
the War Department in 1862 Assistant Topo-
graphical Engineer, he served on the staffs of
Captain (afterwards General) Henry L. Abbot
and Major D. C. Houston, Chief Engineers of
the Nineteenth Army Corps, in the Teche, Port
Hudson, Texas, Florida, and Red River cam-
paigns, receiving special nirntion for efficient
service in the field.

Mr. VAYiot, immediately after his marriage,
sailed for Texas as engineer officer to General
Franklin in the unfortunate expedition wliich
met with such signal defeat in the battle of
Sabine Pass. Returning, he was ordered again
to the Teche country, under General Franklin,
then to Fort Butler at Donaldsonville, and
shortly afterward to the Department of West-
ern Florida, under General Asboth. Later he
was jilaced in charge of the construction of
field fortifications in Eastern Louisiana, under
General Grover, in the intended expedition to
Mobile, after which he took part in the ill-
fated Red River expedition. During the march
to Port Hudson and in the second Teche expe-
dition he had suffered severely from congestive
and malarial fevers, symptoms of which again
appearing, in the latter part of April, 1864,
with impaired health, he returned to Massa-
chusetts.

Mr. Elliot is a member of the Sons of the
American Revolution, of the New England
Historic Genealogical Society, of the American
Historical Association, of the Somerville Board
of Trade, and of other organizations, and ex-
president of the Somerville Historical Society.

After residing successively in Foxboro, Cam-
l)ridgc, Brookline, and Newton, Mr. and Mrs.
]']lliot removed to Somerville, where Mr. Elliot
had lived previous to the war, and where they
have resided for the past thirty years, most
of the time in their present home on Central
Hill. They have four children living: Clara
Zenora, born in Cambridge; Ella Florence, born
in Newton; (Charles Joseph, born in Cambridge;
and Addie Genevieve, born in Somerville.
Their first child, Emily Frances, was born in
Cambridge, July 4, 1865, and died August 2.S,
1865.

Mrs. Elliot's tastes are quiet and luimclike.
She has always been nuich interested in flori-



culture, of which she has an excellent |)ractical
knowledge. She is a well-informed student of
history and literature, and at various times has
wiitten for the press. She is a member of the
Daughters of the American Revolution, of the
Ladies' Aid Association of the Massachusetts
Soldiers' Home, of the Woman's Relief ('or])s, a
life member of the Somervill(&gt; Historical So-
ciety, and a member of several fraternal organ-
izations.



CLARA FRANCES TOWNE (born Ab-
bott) is a native of Barnard, Vt. In
the same town, in the good old State
of Vermont, were born her father,
Austin Abbott, her grandfather, David Ab-
bott, her two brothers, Fred antl Edward Ab-
l)ott, and many of her other relations. She
belongs to a rugged and long-lived family, her
grandfather Abbott attaining the age of eighty-
eight years, and her grandmother eighty-four,
with scarcely a day's illne.ss throughout. She
is distantly related to the Rev. Lyman Abbott,
the Rev. A. V. R. Abbott, and the Rev. Ben-
nett Abbott, and is a niece of Judge Ira A.
Abbott, he being her father's youngest brother.
Her mother, whose maiden name was Heald,
was born in Temple, N.H. Both parents are
still living. In her girlhood she attended the
public schools of her native place and other
towns. Going to Connecticut at the age of
fifteen to live with an aunt, she pursued the
course of study at the normal school in New
Britain, after which she taught school for sev-
eral years, or until her marriage. Ever since
that event she has resided in Boston. She
became interested in i)ainting and in photog-
raphy, for which she developed a talent and
a business ability excelled by few, having at
one time over one hundred and fifty employees
and above one hundred thousand negatives
on file. In 1897 she was made the "official
photographer" of the Food Fair held at Me-
chanics' Building, Boston, and in 1898 she
was made the "official i)hotograplier" of the
great war exposition held at the Boston Audi-
toriinn, Boston, having a fine exhibit in both
places. The Boston Chamber of Connnerce,
in its report, gave a very favoraljle account



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



311



of her work. Energetic -aiul iiulustrious, she
has made a grand success of whatever she has
undertaken. She is of a decidedly literary
turn of mind, has always been fond of books,
has written for many years for newspapers
and magazines, and is at ])resent desii-ous of
eliminating everything from her life that shall
interfere with this her chosen vocation. Ver-
satile and facetious in her writing, she excels
in both poetry and prose, but prefers poetry.
She has written the words to several songs for
the director of nmsic in the Boston public
schools, and has many orders for stories in
leatling magazines. Many of her stories and
sketches are written untler the pen name of
"Cordwainer," which she has used for many
years. She has travelled considerably, and
intends to go to Europe for a season as corre-
spondent for a leading newspajx'r. She is
a public reader of marked ability and a very
successful teacher of elocution and of the guitar.
She was matle one of the council of the Boston
Conservatory of Music in 1901.

She belongs to many prominent lodges and
societies in Boston; is Past Noble Grand of
Mary Washington, Rebekah Lodge, No. 1,
L O. 0. F., of Boston; is the present Worthy
Matron of Mystic Chapter, No. 34, O. E. S., of
Boston, one of the largest and most important
chapters in the order (Governor and Mrs. Bates
are members of this chapter); and is chaplain
of an order. She is a member of the Rebekah
Assembly, the M. and P. Association, the As-
sociated Charities, the Day Nursery, and the
Chapin Club, and is president and founder of
the Clara Frances Towne Fresh Air Mission.
She was made an honorary member of the
A. B. of S. P. and several other social or-
ganizations. She is much souglit for in society,
but dislikes public life, and prefers her (juiet
home at the Victoria, her books and her writ-
ing, to all else.

Mrs. Towne has lived for twenty-five years
in Boston and vicinity, and prefers it to all
other cities, having, however, a strong liking
for Wa,shington, D.C., which may be her future
home. She is very charitable, and has great
love for children and old people. ( )ur space
is too short to give more than a rough sketch
of this remarkably versatile woman. An ex-



tract from a local paper well illustrates her
life "Mrs. Clara Frances Towne, of Boston,
is spending the summer [1903] at Wakefield,
recruiting from a severe illness. Mrs. Towne
is widely known as an artist and writer of great
ability, and has been affectionately called 'the
Helen Gt)uld of Boston ' from her kind and char-
itable disposition, and for years has been known
as the leader in many charitable organizations,
and is especially interested in the care of the
poor children of Boston and suburbs, and does
nmch for their comfort ami pleasure. Her
legion of friends wish her a rapid recovery to
health and sti'ength, as she is one of those rare
noble women who.se services the world can ill
afford to lo.se, even for a short time."



TRYPHOSA DUNCAN BATES (now
known as Mrs. Bates-Batcheller) was
born in the town of North Brook-
field, Worcester County, Mass. She
is the daughter of Theodore Cornelius Bates
and his wife, Emma Frances Duncan. Her
maternal grandmother, Tryphosa Lakin, was
considered a beauty, and she was possessed
of an unusually sweet soprano voice. This
latter gift and the name Tryphosa, in addi-
tion to a very great resemblance iii appearance,
have descended as heirlooms to the subject of
our sketch.

The Bates records go back to the early thir-
teenth century. There is still extant in the
aisle of the old church at Lydd, England, the
brass bas-relief of Bates ancestors. Thomas
Bates, who was Lord Mayor of London and an
intimate friend of King Edward HL, was an
immediate connection of the Lydd branch, ami
possessed the same armorial bearings. Among
the American ancestors may be counted many
heroes of the early colonial wars and several
Revolutionary patriots. Majtn- Daniel Fletcher,
on the paternal side a great-great-grandfather
of Tryphosa, was a commissionetl officer of
the king in the early colonial wars, and had,
as the records show, a distinguished career.
His son, Captain Jonathan Fletcher (maternal
grandfather of Theodore C. Bates), who had
been a private in Captain Samuel Reed's
company of minute-men, which marched ou

his name appears as a fifer from Acton, Mass.,
on the roll of Captain David Wheeler's com-
pany. Colonel Nixon's regiment. Jonathan
Fletcher, of Acton, Lieutenant, Captain Jacob
Haskin's company, Colonel John Jacobs's regi-
ment, engaged February 27, 1778, service
five months, twenty days, at Rhode Island;-
also, same company and regiment, service to
October 1, 1778; also, service from December
1, 1778, to January 1, 1779. After seeing
continuous service as Lieutenant, he was com-
missioned Captain in the Ninth Company of
the Seventh Middlesex County Regiment of
Massachusetts militia, July 27, 1780. ("Mas-
sachusetts Soldiers and Sailors in the W'ar
of the Revolution," vol. v., pp. 776, 777.)

The artistic bent of Tryphosa was shown
at an unu.sually early age. When only three
years old, she was chosen, on account of her
natural aptitude, to impensonate jniblicly " the
Queen of the Dollies" at a charitable peiform-
ance. This role was by no means a thinking
part. Three stanzas fell to the share of the
little queen, and right nobly did .she acquit
her.self. Her precociousncss in nmsical mat-
ters soon .showed itself in a rapid proficiency
in her studies of the violin and piano, .so that
she was repeatedly called upon to play at
semi-public musicales and concerts. Her voice,
however, became so remarkable even in early
years, and so much attention did it attract
from tho.se com])(&gt;tent to judge, that instru-
mental studies were relinquished entirely in
favor of vocal culture. In order to have the
highest and most competent opinions, it was
decided by her ]3arents to send the young
aspirant to Europe. Accomjianied l)y her
mother, Tryphosa accordingly made a trip
to Paris, and sought tlie opinion of Madame



Marchesi. The celebrated teacher enthusias-
tically pointed out that the young girl's voice
was really most beautiful in quality, that it
had the old-time "lyric-velvet" tone, and that,
if every other study could be thrown aside in
its favor, it would be reckoned among the most
remarkable voices of the century. As, how-
ever, just previously to this tri]) abroad Try-
phosa had at the age of seventeen passed
her entrance examinations to Radcliffe College,
her parents thought it advisable for her to con-
tinue for .some time her studies in college before
devoting herself entirely to artistic work.
After some years had been passed at Rad-
cliffe, the urgent letters of Madame Marchesi
prevailed, and Tryphosa with her mother
again went to Paris, this time for a long and
systematic training under the great teacher.

In two years she returned to America in order
to be married to Mr. Francis Batcheller. This
important event in the life of the young artist
was, however, understood not to be a perma-
nent interrui)tion to an important career. As
a cultured amateur, Mr. Batcheller had always
taken the keenest interest in his future wife's
talents, and had aided and encouraged her
in her studies. It followed as. a matter of
course that Paris again claimed the young wife
for a further year's study with Madame Mar-
chesi. The notice of the important critics and
compo.sers was now drawn to the finished artist.
George Boyer, the celebrated critic and poet,
became her teacher in elocution, and was most
enthusiastic in her prai.se. Mas.senet, the great
P^rench compo.s(&gt;r, did her the honor to play
the accompaniments at a concert when she
sang his compositions. On the 9th of June,
1900, Mrs. Bates-Batcheller , made her profes-
sional debut at the Salle Erard in Paris, witii
M. Ed. Maugin, the chef d'orchedre of the
Grand Opera, as her accompanist. The praise
given on this im])ortant occasion fully justified
the many sacrifices an artistic career had
demanded, and predicted great things for the
future. Brilliant professional offers for Paris
and Milan followed as a matter of course, but
were declined in order that every possil)le ad-
vantage might be gained from further study.
A journey to Italy was determined upon for
the .sake of the tuition of Vela and Bimboni.

During her recent stay in America Mrs.
Bates-Batcheller has placed herself under the
care of Georg Henschel, B. J. Lang, and Girau-
det (of the Paris Opera), whose unciualificd
approval she has been fortunate enough to gain.
The artistic frientlship most highly prized
by Mrs. Bates-Batcheller is that of Madame
Maicella Senibrich, who in every way with
help and advice, on hearing her sing, has given
the greatest praise and encouragement. Thus
in course of years the wai-mest attachment
has grown between them. Already in America
Mrs. Bates-Batcheller's voice has attracted
general attention, owing to her generosity
in singing for charitable entertainments. Her
debut in New York City was made at one of
the morning concerts in tlie grand ball-room
of the Waldorf Astoria, where she achieved
the greatest success. This was cjuickly followed
by an aj^pearance at a concert given for charity
by Countess Leary and Mrs. Astor. In writ-
ing of one experience, when she .sang to the
little blind children of the Perkins Institute
in Boston, Mrs. Bates-Batcheller said: "No
audience has ever given me such applau.se, and
I was never more anxious to please than when
I sang to those poor dear little children. Their
hands and feet kept time to the gay songs,
and they hung their heads in sorrow and sym-
pathy with the sad ones." After hearing her
remarkable voice at the New England Woman's
Club, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe dubbed the young
artist "her nightingale," and afterward gave
a delightful musicale in her honor. An added
joy was given to this occasion by the presence
of her college president, Mrs. Louis Agassiz,
who remarked that she was most proud of her
Radcliffe song-bird.

Among the many accomplishments of Mrs.
Bates-Batcheller are to be reckoned an ac-
quaintance with French, German, and Italian
literatures and a fluent use of those languages.
This desirable result was undoubtedly contrib-
uted to by her extended classical studies
in Latin and Greek at Radcliffe College.
Recently the singer has found leisure to
write some excellent lyric poetry that has
received the warm commendation of her friend,
Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton; and it is more
than probable that these poetic flowers will



shortly see the light of publication. As Mrs.
Bates-Batcheller is still a very young woman,
her career may be said to be all before her.

During a recent vi.sit in Washington, Mrs.
Bates-Batcheller, by invitation of Mrs. Roose-
velt, sang at the White House. To meet the
young artist, a most distinguisheil company,
including Senator and Mrs. Cabot Lodge, Sena-
tor Hoar, Secretary Root, Vice-President Frye,
were invitetl. Both the President and Mrs.
Roo.sevelt were delightetl with the voice of Mrs.
Bate.s-Batcheller, who looks back on such a
memorable occasion with the greatest pleasure.
AMiile she has already succeeded in winning
the highest praise from the best French critics
in Paris, she has overcome at her Boston pro-
fessional debut a still greater difficulty — per-
haps the greatest an American-born artisf
ever has to face — the gaining recognition of
high artistic standing in her own city. That
this fortunate result has been achieved beyond
any question there is not the slightest doubt,
for, as the foremost nmsical publication in the
world expresses it, "the general conisensus
of critical opinion expressed at her brilliant
debut has placed her at one bound among the
first artists of the day."

SARAH 1&lt;]LIZAB]&lt;:TH TALBOT, the fir.st
president of the Maiden (Mass.) W. C.
T. U., of which she is now honorary
piesident for life, was born in Hallowcll,
Me., May 1, 1S29, the daughter of Jonas Philip
and Annie (Otis) Lee. Her paternal grand-
father, Samuel Lee (Harvard College, 1770),
a native of Concord, Mass., was a descendant
in the fifth generation of John Lee (or Leigh),
who came from li]ngland and settled at Ipswich,
Massachusetts Bay Colony, in KiSfi. John
Lee is said to have been one of the early patrons
of Harvard College. His name is not given
in the list of indivitlual donors in Quincy's
History of Harvard, but doubtless his con-
tribution helped to make, up the sum accred-
ited to the town of I])swich, of which he was
a resident. Joseph^ Lee, son of John,' born
in Ipswich in 1643, married Mary W^oodis,
daughter of Henry W'oodis (or Woodhouse),
of Concord, Mass., and resided in that town.
Joseph,' son of Joseph^ and Mary, married
Ruth Goodnow, and was father of Dr. Joseph,*
who married Lucy Jones, and grandfather
of their son Samuel,^ above named.

Mrs. Talbot, whose maiden name was Sarah
Elizabeth Lee, has kindly furnished for this
volume the following biographical sketch, to-
gether with a brief notice of the temperance
movement in which she has been an earnest
and faithful worker.

Sanmel Lee, the grandfather of Mrs. Talbot,
after graduating at Harvard and studying law,
went to the British province of New Brunswick,
where he received many honors due a Christian
gentleman and scholar, being appointed judge
and becoming prominently active in formulat-
ing the laws ff)r the new province. He married
Sarah Perry, a beautiful and accomplishetl

woman, daughter of an officer of the Enghsh
army, tlien stationed at Hahfax, N.S. After
his death his widow with her six children re-
moved to the paternal home in Concord, Mass.,
where the youngest son, Jonas Philip, the
father of Mrs. Talbot, was educated.

On becoming of age Jonas P. Lee went to
Maine, entering into business in the town
of Hallowell. He married Annie, daughter
of Oliver Otis, of Leeds, Me. At the age of
eighteen years Mr. Otis went from his native
place, Scituate, Mass., ami purchased land in
Maine, cutting down the original forest. He
married r]lizabeth Stanclifield, and they reared
a family of seven ciiildren to habits of indus-
try and respectability. Always a stanch total
abstainer from alcoholic liquors, in making
his preparations for building the first fraiiKnl
house in that section of the country, Mr. ( )tis
was obliged to drive to Boston with horse and
carriage, a journey of several days, to obtain
sui)plies for the raising. Instead of providing
New England rum, as was the custom on such
occasions, he furnished the best of Java coffee,
a rare treat in those days. Total abstinence
from all intoxicants was conscientiously exem-
plified in his family, resulting in a God-fearing,
intelligent community t(j this day.

After their marriage Jonas P. Lee and his
wife Annie resided in Hallowell. Their daugh-
ter Sarah E. was educated in the excellent
schools of that town, remaining there till her
marriage, October 14, 1851, to Francis Taft
Sargent, a merchant of New York City, and
who was directly descended from Governor
Winthrop, the first Governor of Massachusetts,
and for whom one of their sons was named,
being given the family name of Winthrop Otis
Sargent. Mr. and Mrs. Sargent made their
home in Brooklyn, and united with the Pres-
byterian church of that city. Two children
were born to them there, and their first great
grief came in the death of their beautiful and
most interesting daughter at two years of
age. On account of the ill health of Mr. Sar-
gent, after five years' residence in Brooklyn
they removed to Nassau, New Providence,
Bahamas. Three sons were added to their
family in Nassau, and for a time health seemed
restored in that salubrious climate; but the



seeds of death still lingered, and Mr. Sargent
died suddenly, September 20, 1860, of hem-
orrhage of the lungs. After his death the
widow, with her four little ones, retu,rned to
her native land, arriving in New York on the
day of the first battle of Bull Run, when our
Northern men met for the first time their
Southern brothers in mortal combat and were
defeated. Mrs. Sargent with her children
went inunediately to Farmington, Me., where
dear kinsfolk welcf)me(l her to the new home.
When her two younger sons passed on to the
Father in heaven, she went with their precious
remains to lay them beside the dearly beloved
in Greenwood Cemetery, in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
expecting her brother. Colonel Samuel Perry
Lee, to meet her there. As he could not leave
his post of duty with the Army of the Potomac
at this most critical period of the war, when
the reliels were threatening Wa.shington, with
only three miles between the two armies, lie
recjuested his sister with her son to visit him.
She went immediately to Washington, to find
it one vast hospital, with one hundred thou-
sand sick and wounded soldiers in and around
the city, the Capitol itself being crowdetl. As
she was informed by a friend, one of the prin-
cipal medical directors of the army, the Patent
Office and public buildings, all the churches,
and many temporary hospitals were filled with
the sick and dying. W^e had had very few
battles, but for many months our army had
besieged Richmond, the redel capital, encamp-
ing in and near the dreadful Chickahominy
swamps, filled with malaria, destroying the
health of our .soldiers, throwing out of combat
thousands more than the most fiercely con-
tested battles, as the Southerners well under-
stood. While in Washington, Mrs. Sargent
witnessed a review of this same Army of the
Potomac, with its decimated ranks and worn
and faded uniforms, in evidence of their sail
experience and in contrast with the multitude
of new recruits, full of j^atriotism and strength,
who were being constantly hurried forward to
fill the places of these who had fallen in defence
of our beloved country.

Her brother. Colonel Samuel Perry Lee, was
afterward terribly wouniled at Gettysburg,
losing his right arm at the shoulder joint, and



316

being otherwise injured. lie would i)robably
have died but for the kind and patriotic hos-
l)itality of a wealthy eitizen of the town, who
threw o])en his house to liim, as the ])oor
wouniled man was seen passing on a stretcher.
Colonel Lee was then in the care of his cousin,
the Rev. R. B. Howard, brother of Majf)r-
general Oliver Otis Howard, who coniuiaiided
the Fed(&gt;ral army at Gettysburg until the
arrival of General Meade. Major-general O. O.
Howard lost his right arm in the Ijattle of Fair
Oaks, early in the war, but continued in active
and distinguished service till the close of the
war, a successful (^hristian soldier.

Mrs. Sargent returned to her home in l''arin-
ington with her two remaining sons. On
Novemlier 5, 1868, she married the Hon. Peter
S. J. Taii)ot, of East Machias, Me., descended
from one of the oldest and most respected
families of longland, a man of unblemished
character, repeatetlly chosen by his fellow-
citizens to fill )x)sitions of res])onsibility and
honor in his native town and State. Mr. and
Mrs. Talbot removetl at once to Massachu-
setts, taking uj) their residence in Maiden,
where they made their home for thirty-two
years. In religion Mrs. Talbot is a Congrega-
tionalist. She is a life member of foreign and
home missionary societies.

The two sons, Francis Taft and Winthrop
Otis Sargent, were graduated at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology as mechanical
and mining engineers respectively. Francis T.
Sargent is actively following his profession in
New York. Winthroj) Otis Sargent, as mining
engineer, was interested in the lead mines of
Missouri. He was attacked with hemorrhage
of the lungs, and died on September 5, 1901,
leaving a son, bearing the name of his father,
antl a daughter, liis wife having died two years
previously.

When the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union of Massachusetts was organized as a
branch of the W. C. T. II., with Mrs. Mary A.
Livermore, president, Mrs. L. B. Barrett,' sec-
retary, and an executive committee of seven
women, Mrs. Sarah E. Talbot, of Maiden, was
one of the number, a charter member of the
new organization. Public meetings were held,
churches and halls were crowded, temperance



enthusiasm increased, and many thovisand
inebriates were reformed, organizing them-
selves into Reform Chilis. Timid women,
foi'getting that they "should be seen and not
hearil," came out from their seclusion, went
upon the platform, and as by inspiration joined
in the rescue of those held in bondage of the
intoxicating cup, their hearts (piickened to
realize the sorrows of those in des])air. Ruined
homes were visited, the wives and mothers
bi'ought into the fold of the Woman's Christian
Temjicrance I'nion, their children into the
Loyal Temi)erance Legion ajid Sunday-schools.
Thousands signed the pledge, redeemed for-
ever from the curse of alcoholics and narcotics
under this wonderful movement, which seemed
like a breath of God from heaven moving upon
the hearts of the people.

The first National Convention, resulting in
the formation of the Woman's Christian Tem-
perance Union, was held in Philadelphia, and
the second the next year in Baltimore, Mrs.
Talbot attending both as a delegate. At this
later convention she had the pleasure of vot-
ing for I'Vances E. AMllard as president of the
National Woman's Christian Temperance Union,
which position she honored many years, until
her death, leaving it the largest organization
of women in the world. At the International
Convention of the World's W. C. T. U., held
in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1903, our present
national president, Mrs. L. M. N. Stevens,
presiding, stated that delegates were there
present from " fifty-nine different nations be-
longing to the W'orld's W. C. T. U. Federation,
representing every section of the globe, speak-
ing in many different languages, (iemonstrating
the harmony of the work, notwithstanding
the diversity of languages," thus fulfilling the
prophecy of our sainted president, Miss Wil-
lard, that "the white rilibon would yet en-
circle the globe."

Realizing the danger from indiscriminate use
of alcohol as a medicine, the W^ C. T. U. early
organized a department for "Influencing Phy-
sicians not to use 'Alcoholic Medication,'"
and appointed Mrs. Talbot its first superin-
tendent for the State. She was also appointed
the first superintendent of the State depart-
ment of " Scientific Temperance Instruction

in the Public Schools," having the honor of
piesenting the W. C. T. V. memorial on this
subject before the Legi8lature of Massachusetts
from the speaker's desk in the Housi,' of Rep-
resentatives, with others. The jjctition was
granted, ami aj)pro\'ed temperance text-books,
teaching "the effect of alcohol upon the human
system," are now re&lt;juired by law of this State
in all puljlic schools anil, through the influ-
ence of the National W. C. T. U., in every State
of (jur nation. Mrs. Talbot was an active
member of the State Executive Conunittee
several years, assisting in the general work.
()ne of the first unions of the State was organ-
ized in Maiden, her home, anil she was elected
its first president, which position she occupied
f(jr twenty-five years. It was an active, influ-
ential union, among the first to introduce
scientific temperance instruction in its puljlic
schools of six thousand pupils, promoting a
strong temperance sentiment, the citizens al-
ways voting a very large majority for no license
every year. After her resignation as president,
Mrs. Talbot was unanimously elected hono-
rary presitlent for life of the Maklen W. C. T. U.
She was also made an honorary member for
life of the Massachusetts ^V. C. T. U. These
honors .she appreciates most sincerely, having
been actively associated with both branches
of the organization from their beginning, a
period of thirty years. Retired from active
service, Mrs. Talbot is now (April, 1904) pass-
ing her declining years with her husband at
his birthplace and early home, in East Machias,
Me., where they are surrounded by dear kins-
folk and friends.



LAURA A. GOODNOW MATTOON
(Mrs. William P. Mattoon) was born
__J in Boston, Mass., and comes of Puritan
ancestry, being the daughter of Silas
and Eliza (Pierce) Goodnow. Her mother
was a well-known contralto singer. At the
beginning of the Civil War her father was
a manufactuter in the South; but, as he
refusetl to take the oath of allegiance to the
Confederate government, his property was
confiscated and he was obliged to return
North. At that time the daughter Laura A.



Goodnow was attemling school at the Oread
Institute in W^orcester. From early childhood
she had sh&lt;jwn talent for mimicry and the
promise of a remarkable voice, and she now
left school and became soloist in King's Chapel,
Boston. I^ater she was soprano in a famous
quartet of Springfield, Mass., and she after-
ward sang in Dr. Roilger's church on Fifth
Avenue, New York. She was soloist in the
first triennial celebration of the Handel anil
Haydn Society at Boston, in Music Hall,
in 1865. She was also soloist for the Men-
delssohn Quintet Club and for the Harvard
symphony concerts. She was associatetl with
Annie Louise Cary, Henry Clay Barnabee,
Myron W. Whitney, Teresa Carrefio, and
many other singers who have become famous.

Oliver Wendell Holmes, John B. Gough,
and Thomas Wentworth Higginson, personal
friends of the family, advised her to go into
opera, and she studied with this object in
view, but was obliged to give up her ambition
on account of the serious objections of her
relatives. In 1870 she married William P.
Mattoon, of Springfield, and took up her
residence in that city. For years she has
devoted her talents, strength, and time for
charity, and, without compensation to herself,
has rai,sed time after time substantial sums
for the charities both of Springfield and the
surrounding towns. She has sung and actetl
in numberless operas and plays, and has
drilled the young people to put on smooth,
artistic dramatic attractions. Coaching ama-
teurs is one of her ilelights, and she is
still able and willing to take part herself when-
ever rkecessary. Her clever work as Little
Buttercup ("Pinafore") in the Springfield local
opera company, of which she was mana-
ger, will never be forgotten by those who
saw her in the role. She has played only
for charities, and has earned for various
worthy objects over twenty thousand dollars.

She is a clever monologist, and her talents
are shown to especial advantage in a mono-
logue called "For Charity," written for her
by Clyde Fitch.

Mr. and Mrs. Mattoon have one child,
Laura Isabella Mattoon. She is a graduate
of Wellesley College, has been a po^t-graduate

her second degree at Columbia. She is at

Veltin School for Girls in New York City.



JENNIE PATRICK WALKER who has
for years enjoyed the enviable reputation
of being the leading oratorio singer of the
United States, is a native of Warren,
Worcester County, Ma,ss. Her birthplace was
the old homestead which was purchased by
Matthew Patrick, her great-grandfather, in
1740, and has been occu]iied by five successive
generations. The Patrick family has ever
taken active interest in the progress of the town
of Warren (originally Western). The pioneer
settler above named served as its Representa-
tive in the State Legislature in 17.S9, his son,
Isaac Patrick, Mrs. Walker's grandfather, serv-
ing in 1826 and LS27. Her father, William
Andrew Patrick, also held i)ul)lic offices of
trust and responsibility. For thirty years
choir-master and singing-teacher, he tried to
establish a higher musical standard in the com-
munity. He died in 1S92. Through her
mother, Mrs. Jane Blo&lt;lgett Patrick, daughter
of Alden Blodgett, of Stafford, Conn., Mrs.
Walker is a direct descendant of Thomas Blodg-
ett, an early settler of Cambridge, Mass., and
of John Alden, of the "Mayflower" and Plym-
outh Colony.

Sewall's History of Woburn states that
Thomas Blodgett with his wife and two sons,
DanieP and Samuel,^ came in the "Increase"
from London in 1635. SamueP Blodgett a
number of years later settled in Woburn.
Samuel, Jr.,' son of Samuel,^ married Huldah
Simontls, and was the father of Sanmel,^ born,
say the records, in 1683, and of Daniel,* born
in 1685.

Daniel* and SamueP Blodgett removed from
Woburn to Stafford, Tolland County, Conn.
"Samuel left a son Joshua, born in 1721, reared
by his uncle Daniel" (History of Tolland
County).

Joshua Blodgett married Hannah Alden,
daughter of Daniel* Alden (of Bridgewater,
Mass., and Stafford, Conn.) and his wife, Abi-
gail Shaw. Daniel* was of the fourth genera-



tion of Alliens in New England, Ijeing desceniled
from John' Alden and his wife Priscilla through
their son Josejih,^ who married Mary Simmons,
and Joseph,^ who married Hannah Dunham
and was father of Daniel* (Mitchell's Bridge-
water) .

Deacon Alden Blodgett, son of Joshua and
Hannah, was born in Stafford in 1766, died in
184S. He was the father of a second Alden,
doubtless the Alden Blodgett of Stafford, Conn.,
above named, Mrs. Walker's grandfather.

The love and talent for nmsic were native
to Jennie Patrick. Her doctor uncle, Julius
Blodgett, her mother's brother, said of her
voice in infancy, "That is music, not merely
a baby's cry"; and this remark was verified by
the child's singing before she had learned to
talk. After graduating from the high school in
Warren at the age of sixteen, she came to Bos-
ton and became a pupil of Fanny Frazer Foster,
taking her first position the following year at
the Channing Church in Newton, where she
remained for two and a half years. From the
first her voice created a furor, and by consci-
entious work she made rapid progress. From
Newton she went to Worcester to sing in the
Church of the Unity, remaining until 1878,
when she accepted a position at the Second
Church in Boston. After eight years' success-
ful work there .she was for fifteen years a mem-
ber of the choir of the Arlington Street Church,
which for a number of years hafl the reputation
of being the best in Boston.

Her great success as a choir singer was ri-
valled by that achieved by her in the fields of
oratorio and concert, where the rare iiuality
of her rich soprano voice created a large de-
mand for her services. Mrs. Walker has studied
only with teachers in the city of Boston, and
is well known and beloved here and in the West
and South, where she has often appeared. She
has sung in concerts with such celebrities as
Lilli Lehmann, Campanini, Dippel, Melba,
Noi-dica, Emil Fischer, Gadski, Ben Davies,
p]dwaril Lloyd, Watkin Mills, and many other
noted singers. She has sung for most of the
leading oratorio associations of America and
for the Cecilia and Apollo Clubs of Boston,
also for the Handel antl Haydn Society, of
which for eight seasons she was solo soprano.

She is a member of some of the leading musical
clubs, and is deeply interested in the nmsical
l)rogresH of Boston. Through all of her busy
life she has conscientiously kept up her prac-
tice, with the result that her voice has lost
none of the rich dramatic sweetness of earlier
years, and has gained in power and tone color.
Her work last season was received with warmest
praise.

January 1, 1878, she was married to Mr.
William Walker, a New Yorker by birth, at
that time established in the printing business
in Boston, and now of the well-kno\yn firm of
Walker, Young &amp; Co., printers.

For a number of years Mr. and Mrs. Walker
have passed their summers at Crow Point,
Hingham, Mass., ami now they have taken up
their abode in Hingham for the winter. Do-
mestic in her tastes, Mrs. Walker thoroughly
enjoys her home life with its daily round of
duties and its quiet pleasures.



MARIE ELIZABETH ZAKRZEW-
SKA, M.D., was born in Berlin,
Prussia, September 6, 1829. On
her father's side she was descended
from a very old Polish family, which fled
from Poland in 1793, when their estates had
been confiscated on account of their liberal
principles. Her mother's family can be
traced back to the eighteenth century. Her
great-grandmother, Marie Elizabeth Sauer,
was a gypsy queen of the Lombardi tribe.
She married a Captain Urban, also a member
of that tribe. They had nine children, Marie's
grandmother being the fifth in order of birth.
Marie was the eldest, of a family of five
children. The father held a government
position, but, having offended his superiors
by the expression of revolutionary sentiments,
he was summarily retired upon a very small
pension, m consequence of which his family
was reduced to poverty. In order to provide
for their support, Madame Zakrzewska entered
the school of midwifery in Berlin, and later
practised the profession with great success.

During a portion of the time of her mother's
hospital training, Marie was permitted to
reside with her in the hospital. Here she



became a great favorite of one of the phy-
sicians. At her retjuest he lent her two books,
"The History of Midwifery" and "The History
of Surgery." These she read through in six
weeks, and, according to her own account,
dated from this time her interest in the study
of medicine. She was then about eleven
years old.

Upon leaving the hospital she returned
to school, which she quitted at the age of
thirteen and a half, and at once entered upon
the usual training of a German girl in house-
wifery. She soon tired of this, and did not
gain credit for good work in her family, al-
though the experience served her in later
life by enabling her to become a notable house-
keeper.

As her mother's practice increased, she
began to assist her in the care of her patients.
She found this so much to her taste, that she
decided to study the professiqn. After various
delays, causetl by her youth and her father's
opposition, she was admitted to the Charite
as a special pupil of the director, Dr. Joseph
Herman Schmidt, who took the greatest
interest in her development, and, seeing
her remarkable ability, determined to fit her
for the post of chief of the school for mid-
wives, a position which had never been held
by a woman.

She was graduated with honor, and received
the appointment. Unfortunately, Dr. Schmidt
died immediately after, and she was left with-
out his aid, in a position which was coveted
by many, who were consequently unfriendly
to her. Finding it impossible to maintain
this position without losing her self-respect,
she soon resigned. Her friends were desirous
that she should settle in Berlin, but she had
meanwhile conceived of a hospital for women,
attended by women; and, although she dared
not tell any one of so wild a project, she deter-
mined not to be satisfied until it was fulfilled.
Knowing this to be impossible in Berlin,
she turned her thoughts toward America,
as a place where she might be free to carry
out her intentions without the limitations
surrounding her in the Old World.

On March 15, 1853, accompanied by one
of her sisters, she left Berlin, and after a tem-



320



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



pestuous voyage landed in New York on the
22d of May. Coming without friends, anil
entirely ignorant of the English language,
it is not wonderful that she at first found
no encouragement for her project.

She had tletennined on no account to ask
help from her father, and tlierefore, when
she found tliat there was no inunediate pros-
pect of earning her living by practicing her
profession, she turned her practical ability
into other channels, and for a time supportcil
herself ami her sister by manufacturing worsted
goods and other articles.

Although she was quite successful in these
ventures, she never forgot her real object
in life. Her introduction to Dr. Elizabeth
Blackwell, which occurred about a year after
her arrival in this country, she rightly con-
sidered the turning-point of her fortune in
America. Dr. Blackwell at once discerneil
the unconnnon ((ualities of the stranger, in
spite of the foreign language, and inteicsted
herself most heartily in her behalf. She
told her that she must learn the English lan-
guage, and obtain the degree of Doctor of
Medicine from a reputable college before
she could hope to practise successfully. Through
Dr. Blackwell's influence she was admitted to
the Cleveland Medical College, where she was
graduated in 1856. After her graduation the
faculty, as a mark of respect for her character
and abilities, remitted her lecture fees, for
which she had been obliged, for lack of ready
money, to give her promissory note. She
returned to New York, and took an office
with Dr. Blackwell, who had opened a small
dispensary for women and children, and was
trying to collect funds for the establislunent
of a small hospital in connection with it.

Into this project Dr. Zakrzewska entered
with heart and soul, and by her contagious
enthusiasm aided greatly in accomplishing
it. In May, 1857, the New York Infirmary
was opened. P\)r two years she gave her
time to it gratuitously, acting both as super-
intendent and resident physician.

During these years she had several times
visited Boston in the interests of the New
York work, and thus become acquainted
with a circle of noble men and women who



were ready to lend a hand to any good object.
In the spring of 1859 she was asked to take
charge of a small hospital connected with
the New England Female Medical College
of that city.

Feeling that the New York hospital was
now well started, and that she might advance
the cau.se of women physicians more in another
place, she acce])ted the invitation, and came
to Boston in June. She did not find' there,
however, the cliance for carrying on her own
ideas of hospital management, and at the
end of three years she resigned.

Her friends now decided to hire a small
hou.se and fit it up as a hospital, which should
be under her management. It was a cour-
ageous untlertaking. It was in 1862. The
civil war was at its height, and it was very
difficult to enlist public interest in anything
else. Few people knew anything about
women physicians, and the majority of those
who had heard of them, regarded the idea of
women doctors with a mixture of incredulity
and suspicion.

Dr. Zakrzewska, however, possessed in a
high degree, the power of interesting others
in whatever she undertook, and she soon
gathered about her an enthusiastic group
of people, who were devoted to her and her
work, and who believed firmly that whatever
she undertook would be accomplished.

The hospital struggled on, feebly at first,
but soon began to grow, and, after several
times enlarging its quarters, was enabled in
1872 to build its present substantial structure
in Roxbury. Other buildings have gradually
been added, until the institution now includes
medical, surgical, maternity, and dispensary
buildings, together with a nurses' home and
all the accessories of a well-appointed modern
hospital.

The hospital staff, which at first consisted
of Dr. Zakrzewska and a young assistant,
in 1893 numbered over forty women phy-
sicians connected with its work; and Dr.
Zakrzewska lived to .see all this 'accomjilished.

She held successively the post of resident
physician, senior attending physician, and
.senior advisory physician, which last she re-
tained until her death. As one of the chief



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



321



objects of the hospital, as set forth in its charter,
is the giving of opportunities for practical
work to young women doctors, a large number
of them have ^ined their hospital experience
in its wards under her instruction. She
always took the greatest interest in these
stuilents, giving them freely of her great
experience, and encouraging them in tlieir
anxieties at the beginning of their career.
All over this country, and even in Europe,
are practicing women doctors, who will always
look back gratefully to the advice she gave
them, and the things she taught them in the
hospital.

Her hospital work ditl not absorb the
whole of her time. She gradually acquired
a large private practice in Boston and vicinity,
and she was well known among ricli and poor
for her medical skill, her wise practical ad-
vice, and her interest in every class of humanity,
and especially in any questions relating to
the advancement of opportunities for women.

She was one of the early members of the
New England Woman's Club of Boston, and
always took the greatest interest in its work.
She was thoroughly alive to all the burning
social questions of the times, ami often con-
tributed, either by papers or talks, to the
practical solution of such questions.

She continued the active practice of med-
icine until 1899, when she felt herself no longer
able to bear the strain. With her dear friend
and companion, Miss Julia A. Wprague, she
retired to a small house in the neighborhood of
Boston, where she hoped to enjoy some years
of leisure after her strenuous toil. She found,
however, that she hail overtasked her splendid
physical powers, and during the rest of her
life she suffered greatly from a nervous trouble,
which made it impossible for her to lead any-
thing but an al)solutely quid existence. Ex-
hausted by this trouble, she died on May 13,
1902.

By her own request there was no funeral
service, but relations and friends gathered
quietly, to hear a paper which she had herself
prepared for the occasion.

On October 29, 1902, a memorial service
was held for her in Chickering Hall, where
a notable company, including Mrs. Julia Ward



Howe, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, Mrs. Mary
A. Livermore, and Mr. William Lloytl Garrison,
Jr., sought to express their appreciation of
her. Some of her associates in the hospital
spoke of her hospital and medical work, while
a German (juartet sang selections from the
music she loved.

The meeting was closed by the following
benediction from Mrs. Howe: "I pray God
earnestly that we may never go back from
the ground which our noble pioneers and
leaders have gained for us. I pray that these
bright stars of merit, set in our firmament,
may guide us to a truer love and service to
God and man."

EUGENIA BROOKS FROTHINGHAM
is a young author whose work in let-
ters is as yet designated by quality
rather than quantity, her literary abil-
ity not having been called into definite use
until recently. As a maker of books from
choice and not necessity, she can write in
leisurely manner and because she has some-
thing to say. Born in Paris, France, in 1874,
she is of New England parentage, being the
daughter of Ivlward and I'Aigenia (Mittiin)
Frothingham, of Boston. One of her great-
grandfathers on the maternal side was the
Hon. Ik'njamin W. Crowninshield, Secretary
of the Navy, 1814-lS, under Presidents Madi-
son and Monroe.

Her early education was received in this
coimtry. She has also studied and travelled
wi(U&gt;ly abroad. Of musical and artistic tem-
perament, always a student, she is a member
of many clubs, among them the Saturday
Morning, Authors', and MacDowell.

Her first book, "The Turn of the Road,"
pul)lished in 1901, possessed a charm and
merit that gave it instant recognition. It
was one of the six best selling books of the
year.

"Only an Episode," vvliich api)eared in the
Atlantic, is a story of absorbing interest. It
is an instance of keen analysis and strong
character portrayal!

shows her power as an essayist, her article on
Wilham Butler Yeats and his work toward the
revival of Irish literature being one that to
read is a delight. It is a noticeable thing in
Miss Frothinghani's writing that she never
seems to have "talked herself out": there is
always evidence of resources in reserve.

Miss I'"rothinghani intends to make literature
her profession. Another volume of fiction is
in preparation. She is now (winter of 1904)
in Paris, and later will move on to Sicily.
Though the social demands of Boston's best
circles upon her time are many, her tastes
impel her to her library and desk, wlience, it
is safe to prophesy, will come volumes from
lier pen which will hold a place among the
brilliant books of the present decade.



/iDDIE AUGUSTA NOTTAGE, who
/\ has been active in patriotic and char-
X jL itable work for more than forty years,
is a native of Boston and a graduate
of the Hancock School in that city. Her
maiden name was Kingsbury. She was born
April 5, 1839, daughter of Daniel W. and Sylvia
(Wild) Kingsbury. Her maternal grandpar-
ents were William and Sally (Thayer) Wild.
On July 7, 1864, Addie A. Kingsbury was mar-
ried to Josiah Marshall Nottage, a veteran of
the Civil War. Mr. Nottage enlisted in the
Eighth Massachusetts Battery. (Contracting a
fever in the army, he was honorably discharged
as an invalid, and in after life never fully re-
gained his health. His &lt;leath occurred Sep-
tember 13, 1894. Mr. Nottage was a member
of John A. Hawes Po.st, No. 159, G. A. R., of
East Boston. He was a son of Josiah and
Tharce Lowd (Penniman) Nottage. His father
was born in New Hampshire, and his mother
in Braintree, Mass.

Mrs. Nottage has been active for a long time
in the temperance cause. For fifteen years,
iK'ginning in her girlhood, .she was identified
with the Daughters of Rechab. This society,
formed in March, lS4r), in Boston, was the first
organized movement of woTuen for the pro-
motion of temperance in Massachusetts. Its
official title was "The Independent Order of
the United Daughters of Rechab, " and sub-



ordinate societies were termed "tents." Its
motto was Temperance, Fortitude, Justice,
and its principles were founded upon the thirty-
fifth chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. While
temperance was the leading principle of the
order, its members were bound by the strong-
est ties of sisterly affection. To assist each
other as "friends travelling together" was one
of its objects. The society prospered for many
years, and hundreds of tents were instituted
throughout the country.

The Sons of Temperance and the Indepen-
dent Order of Good Templars, formed a few
years later, admitted women to membership
and the Order of Rechabites decreased in num-
bers, many of its members feeling that more
effective work couUl be accomplished in the
organizations formed on a broader basis.
I'ntil a few years ago, however. State encamp-
ments of the Daughters of Rechab were held
semi-annually in Boston, continuing their ses-
sions three and four days. The presiding
officer was called "Worthy Senior Matron,"
and the chaplain bore the title of "Encamp-
ment Shepherdess." Two tents in Boston,
the North Star and Olive Branch, continued
their work nearly forty years. Mrs. Nottage
was Worthy Senior Matron of one of the Bos-
ton tents. She also joined the Sons of Tem-
perance, and for twenty years was active in
Neptune Division, No. 29, of Boston, filling
all the prominent offices.

Mrs. Nottage is a Past Noble Lady of Hamlin
Lodge, of Boston, Independent Order of Odd
Ladies. She is deeply interested in the prin-
ciples of Odd Fellowsliip, and is a Past Grand
of Mary Washington Lodge, Daughters of Re-
becca, Boston. The ritualistic work of the
D. of R. is familiar to her, and she is often in-
vited to partici]iate in the ceremonies of other
lodges. The Rebecca Merriam Lodge of Rox-
bury presenteil her a gold badge in apprecia-
tion of the impressive manner in which she
delivered the address for the lodge.

It is in patriotic work, however, that
Mrs. Nottage is most widely known. Every
week for three years (]8(il-(i4) during the
Civil War she assisted in the work carried on
in Boston, under the leadership of Mrs. Harri-
son Gray Otis, of making garments and fur-

nishing supplies for the soldiers, lii recognition
of her services Mrs. Otis gave her a diploma.
Mrs. Nottage was a regular visitor to the Sol-
diers' Home on West Springfield Street, Bos-
ton, and supplied its inmates with jellies and
other delicacies. She attended, with the Rev.
Phineas Stowe, the funeral services of all the
men who died in the home. Her father pre-
sented the flag that was used at the burial
services.

Captain George W. Creasey, superintendent
of the present Soldiers' Home in Chelsea,
Mass., in his annual report for 1902 stated
that the first State home, " or the first Soldiers'
Home established for the care of the sick and
disabled veterans of the war of the Rebellion,
and where an appropriation was maLle by the
State Legislature for its maintenance, was
located in Massachusetts. Li May, 1862," he
continued, "a Soldiers' Home organization
was formed by a large number of philanthropic
citizens of Boston and vicinity. The Rev.
Phineas Stowe, a devoted friend of seamen,
presented the fact of the destitute condition
of some of the discharges! soldiers to the notice
of a benevolent merchant, Daniel Tenney,
Esq., who promptly granted the free use of
a large warehouse, to be occupied as a home,
and contributed a liberal sum of money for
its maintenance.

"At the meeting m May, 1862, a constitu-
tion and set of by-laws were adoptetl, which
provided the association should be conducted
under the name of 'The Discharged Soldiers'
Home,' and ' the design of the institution is
to provide a comfortable home for such per-
sons who are in need as have been honorably
discharged from the army of the United States
by reason of their sickness or woumls.' On
July 4, 1862, the home was formally opened
by religious services and appropriate addresses.
"In July, 1863, the city of Boston granted
the managers the use of a commodious build-
ing on Springfielil Street, where the home con-
tinued in active operation until the spring of
1870. From its opening in 1862 to A]m\,
1870, three thousand, seven hundred and forty-
three soldiers were admittefl. The State of
Massachusetts appropriate&lt;l in the aggregate
eighty-five thousand dollars for its support,



while thirty thousand, seven hmidred and fifty-
four dollars and twelve cents was contributed
by citizens. The discontinuance of the home
was determined upon after the transfer to the
Togus Home in Maine of such members as
were not credited to Massachusetts during the
war. ' '

Mrs. Nottage esteems it an honor to have
been associated with work for this home, and
also consitlers it a privilege to assist the present
Soldiers' Home. She was identified with the
first efforts in behalf of the Chelsea home, and
aided Mrs. Sarah E. Fuller in raising money
for gifts presented at its dedication in June,
1884.

Mrs. Nottage joined the Ladies' Aid Soci-
ety connected with Joseph Hooker Post, No.
23, G. A. R., of East Boston. This society
was one of the first associated with a Grand
Army post. She was a charter member of
Corps No. 3, organized October 12, 1883, as
an auxiliary to John A. Hawes Post, No. 159,
and has held all the corps offices. As a presi-
dent, she was earnest and progressive.

She has participated in many department
conventions, serving on conmiittees and as
Chief Guard. During National Encampment
week in Boston in 1890 she was a member of
the information committee, and is a worker on
the executive and other committees for the
national convention in Boston the present year
(1904). She has been a delegate to national
conventions, and has served several years as a
National Aide. For three years she rendered
excellent service as a member of the Depart-
ment Relief Committee. Mrs. Nottage has
received an appointment as Dejjartment Special
Aide from several Department Presidents, and
her work is appreciated. Her heart is in this
work, and she has visited himdreds of families
where sickness antl poverty had cast their
shallows, always leaving a ray of sunshine.
With a sympathetic nature and practical busi-
ness training, she is thoroughly atlapted to the
work of relief, protecting the interests of the
organization she represents while responding
liberally to the appeals of worthy applicants.

Mrs. Nottage is an indefatigable worker for
fairs in aid of church and charitable objects,
being a woman of unusual executive ability.

LILLIAN LAWRENCE, for several
years the leading lady at the Castle
J iScjuare Theatre in Boston, occupies
a unique position among American
stage favorites. Many an actress possessing
her beauty, grace, and charm of manner
might have been content with the measure of
p\il)lic a)i])lause l)estowed upon her for these
((ualities alone. She, however, has preferred
to win her laurels by ste^ady ajjplication and
untiring devotion to her work, striving con-
stantly and e;irnestly to attain to her highest
conception of each new role, iloing always her
best. As a reward for this persistent endeavor
and constant study, she holds to-day an en-
viable jjlace as a stock company principal of
great versatility. She was born in i)ictu-
resque Alexandria, ^'a. Her family later re-
moving to California, her girlhood was spent
within sight of thc&gt; Golden Gate.

When she was in the grannnar school in San
Francisco, she was chosen by the manager of
the Bush Street Theatre as one of more than
a score of childien to take part in a living
chess spectacle, antl began her stage career as
Queen's Knight in "A Royal Middy." For the
next three seasons she sang in light opera in
tlie same theatre. At the age of sixteen she
began a two years' engagement with a stock
company in Oakland, Cal., and when twenty
years of age she joined a small dramatic com-
pany which toured California. She next made
her appearance with the Cordray Stock Com-
pany in engagements which took her ovitside
the State, presenting each week a different play.
Here it was that she acquired her remarkable
facility for acting one part while studying an-
other. Here, too, she realized to the full how
different from the stage-struck girl's idea are
the realitie^s of stage life, with its endless rou-



tine of rehearsals every morning, matinee every
day, fitting of new costumes, attention to in-
finitesimal details, new parts to study and pre-
pare for, and evening performances before en-
tirely different audiences each night.

In 1892 she came East, and was at once en-
gaged to play Marie Louise to Rhea's Joseph-
ine. Her next engagement was with Kate
Claxton, when she played Henriette in "The
Two Orphans." After that a stock company
in Dayton, Ohio, claimed her services. Fol-
lowing these experiences she appeared with
Miss Minnie Seligman at the Madison Square
Theatre, with Miss Katherine Clemmons at
the Fifth Avenue, and with Miss Carrie Turner
in "The Crust of Society." She also filled en-
gagements with the National Theatre Stock
Company in Washington, and played Shake-
sjiearean roles with Thomas W. Keene. After
a successful season in the rtMe of Mrs. Bulford
in "The Great Diamond Robbery" and in a
widel)' diffeient role in "The Bachelor's Baby"
she l)egan in 1X95 an engagement at the Castle
Square Theatre in Boston, which lasted five
years. The next two years she played in W^ash-
ington, D.C., returning in 1903 to the Castle
Si|uare Theatre.

The Washington Poi&lt;t of Aj^ril 6, 1902, says
of her: "Although she has been here for so
short a time, we have come to look upon this
jjopular -leading lady as one of us, and we want
to keej ^^er There is something- about her
which is distinctly refreshing. She is a woman
whom evMy one is glad to know and welcome
in hrs home. 'Everybody loves her' is very
generally the comment whenever her name is
mentioned.

" Miss Lawrence possesses beauty and per-
sonality as distinct from those of other ac-
tresses as is her work. Her Grecian profile
is known and admired all over the LInited State's.
Photographers have taken ])ictures of her,
artists have painted her, and sculptors have
jierpetuated her features in marble, because
of their classic beauty combined with the dig-
nity and sw(&gt;etness of her character. It has
been surprising to those who have watched
Miss Lawrence's work to discover that with
the majesty of her carriage and the classic out-
line of her face she possesses a love for com-

edy roles and enters into such parts with amaz-
ing vivacity."

The same paper pubHshes an interview with
her in which she tells of her early ambition to
become a soubrette, which she was forced to
give up because of her rapidly increasing inches.
"But the love for cometly still remains," says
Miss Lawrence. " It will out, no matter how
hard I try to suppress it. I cannot say, how-
ever, that I prefer comedy parts to strong emo-
tional ones."

Mr. Lewis C. Strang, whose opinion in dra-
matic matters is worth good weight in gold,
says of her, " Miss Lawrence has the intelli-
gence to present with commenilable ease and
with more than ordinary success even parts
that are not in her line."

Speaking of the extraordinary number of
parts she has taken. Miss Lawrence says: "I
started at one time to count them, but lost the
count. At any rate, I know that the number
exceeds that of any other actress. One thing
which has assistetl me greatly in my work is
my memory. Even when a chikl I memorized
so rapidly as to be a source of wonder to my
family and friends. Learning a .part is not
so much a matter of memory as it is of con-
centra tioii, and^l possess that also~T,'o aTfarked
degree. "But, while I memorize with facility,
I forget as easily. Perhaps I should not say
forget: rather, I store away in my mind the
impression of a part which I have .icfii" arned,
and when I need it again all I have to do is
to read the okl role over once or twice-, and it
all flashes liack to me. It would be impossible
to retain any part when one learns a new play
each week, and has no particular reason for
thinking of the previous study. Shakesjjeare's
plays are exceptions to this rule, I find. I
think the reason is that Shakespeare is so deep.
His language is so beautiful, so full of mean-
ing, and expressed so differently from modern
playwrights that one has to study him very
thoroughly indeed to understand his lines
rightly. With modern plays one could easily
substitute one's own words and derive the
same or nearly the same effect."

She admits that stock company work is ex-
tremely taxing, but finds that it has its com-
pensations in permitting her to remain in one



place, instead of roaming all over the coun-
try with practically no home nor opportunity
to make warm friends. That she has a host
of these was clearly proved on the night when
she closed her first long engagement at the
Castle Square Theatre in the winter of 1900,
when the house was filled to its utmost capac-
ity with an enthusiastic audience, who testified
to their admiration and esteem in flowers and
in farewell gifts.

Miss Lawrence is always interested in the
people she meets, many of whom remind her
of flowers — violets, forget-me-nots, roses, pan-
sies, poppies, and even sunflowers. Names
also appeal to her, ami one of her most cher-
ished friendships she owes to this fact. A
child who had seen her from before the foot-
lights venturecl, to call at her hotel. Miss
Lawrence was about to send excuses, when the
beautiful name attracted her attention and
altered her decision. She also has a great deal
of sentiment regarding her wardrobe, planning
all her gowns as to color, fabric, and fashion,
and finding genuine delight in clothing her
various characters. "For instance," she re-
marked upon one occasion, " I would not think
of using the gown worn as Camille for any other
character, for to me that gown is a part of the
character itself. Then, too, certain shades
seem to go with certain people and be a part
of their temperaments."

The Actors' Church Alliance, that admirable
organization tending to bring about a closer
understantling between the stage people and
the rest of mankind, has a powerful counsellor
and advocate in Miss Lawrence. To her per-
sonal aid and enthusiasm is largely due the
success of the Boston chapter, numbei'ing over
four hundred members. Her good works are
many, but are seldom tliscovered by any save the
recipients. A great-hearted benevolence, ask-
ing no questions, histant and constant in its
sincerity, is one of her jjronounced traits.

Among Miss Lawrence's most cherished pos-
sessions are an immense silver loving-cup, pre-
sented her as a Christmas gift by patrons of
the Castle Square Theatre; a girdle and cestus
pendant, composed of sixty-nine fifty-cent
pieces, engraved, which, together with a bag
of gold and monogramed pieces, amounting

to five hundred (loll;ir.s, was presented to her
on the memorable occasion of her farewcll-to-
Boston a])pearanpe in 1900. Among the plays
(far too numei'ous to he given in detail) in
which she has sustained important rol(&gt;s may
he mentioned "Tiie J&gt;ady of Lyons," " Frou
Frou," "Captain Leltcrijlnir," "She Stooj)s
to Conquer," "The Prisoner of Zenda," "Fe-
dora," "Nathan Hale," "Under Two Flags,"
" Romeo and Juliet," " The Merchant of Venice."



CORA AGNES BENNESON, counsellor-
at-law and s]iecial connnissioner. —
Wherever in history a ]ieison is found
whose ])lan of life has been drawn from
within, whose course has been majiped out
without precedents, that man or woman justly
challenges attention. The last third of a cen-
tury has furnished not a few women of inde-
pendent thought antl action who have vindi-
cated the right of each individual to do that
for which he or she is fitted by nature. Younger
women too easily forget the debt they owe
these women of earnest conviction and liberal
spirit.

To find Miss Benneson well established in
the heart of a conservative conmiunity in what
is for women a new profession, accorded on
every hand jjrofessional and scholarly recogni-
tion, allows one to judge of her initiative, in-
tellectual power, and gentle persistence. Her
youth fell at a period when women were be-
coming active forces in society. Colleges and
universities were being opened to them as well
as to men. Girls were Ix'ginning to study, not
because it was the fashion, but because they
were impelled by an awakening self-conscious-
ness.

The circumstances of Miss Benneson's birth
and parentage made it quite impossible that
she should be provincial or her oj)inions nar-
i-ow. Th(&gt; conununity in which her eai'ly years
were s])ent was made uj) of jjeople from all
tile older ])arts of the country. Her father,
liolx'i't Smith BciiiH'snn, went when a young
man from Philadelphia to (^uincy. III., where
he became an influciitiid and wealthy citizen.
He w;is born in Newark, Del., the son of the
Rev. Thomas and Jane (Carlyle) Benneson



(name originally Benson). He was of a strong,
long-lived family, and seemed always to be
the embodiment of health and good cheer. Be-
cause of his integrity and ability as a financier
he was naturally called to positions of trust.
He combined the keen insight of a man of
affairs with an nctive iidcrest in matters of
public moment, es])ecially education. Through
his efforts the original act levying taxes for
school {purposes in Illinois was passed by the
L(&gt;gislature. For fourteen years he was presi-
dent of the Boanl of l']ducation of Quincj', a
longer time one of its members. While Mayor
he i)re,'-erved the credit of that city by giving
his personal notes for its debts.

Miss Benneson's mother, Electa Ann Park
Benneson, was a descendant of Richard Park,
who came from England and was a proprietor
in Cambridge, Mass., in ]6o5. His house stood
"near the cow conmion," the land at present
bounded by Linna\an Street, Garden Street,
and Massachusetts Avenue. In 1647 he crossed
the Charles River into that part of the town
familiarly known as Cambridge A^illage (the
territory since comprised in Brighton and New-
ton), where he had eleven acres and a house
within a few feet of the spot now occupied by
the Eliot Church. A little to the north-west
of this lay his large tract of six hundred acres,
bordering on the Charles River. His only son,
Thomas Park, inherited this estate, ^^'hen di-
vided among his heirs, 1693-94, it comprised
seven hundred twenty-two acres and part of a
corn-mill on Smelt Brook. (See Jackson's His-
tory of Newton, ]). 3S2, and maj) affixed.)

Miss Benneson's grandfather, Daniel Har-
rington Park, descended in the fourth genera-
tion from Richard Park, was born in Massa-
chusetts, but was taken, when in his second
year, by his father to Connecticut. In man-
hood he became a resident of \Vrmont, where
he married \\'elthy Ladd. In that State, at
South Royalton, Miss Benneson's mother was
born.

^\'hen a young woman, Annie Park, as she
was generally called, taught school for a few
years near th(&gt; birthiilace of her father in
Brighton, Mass. Some of its prominent citi-
zens, once her pupils, still hold her instruc-
tion in grateful remembrance. While visiting

frieiuls in Quiiicy, 111., she met Robert Benne-
son, to whom she was afterward married, ami
there they fouiuled their home. Their interests,
whether eilueational, religious, or philanthropic,
were identical. Mr. l^enneson valued his wife's
sountl judgment and keen intuition in business
matters above that of all other counsellors.
Each respected the individuality of the other
and of their children. They helped to estab-
lish the Unitarian church in that section of the
West, gave to it liberally both of their labor
and of their means, and were devotetl to its
interests throughout their lives. For many
years Mrs. Benneson was superintendent of the
Sunday-school. "Do right because it is right"
was the keynote of her teaching. Her activity
was not confined to her home and church.
Any movement aiming at the good of the com-
nmnity found in her a ready helper. In what-
ever she undertook her foresight and execu-
tive ability led her to be successful. She was
much interested in the Woodland Home, an
asylum for orphans and friendless, ami united
all of the churches of her city in a large fair
for its benefit, over which she presided. During
the Civil War she devoted herself to the sol-
diers' families and to the wounded in the hos-
pitals, even receiving two from the latter into
her own home, where they were cared for until
convalescent.

Mrs. Benneson was always the same — self-
sacrificing, courageous, forceful, not easily sur-
prised, remarkably even-tempered and well-
balanced. Her feelings found expression in
deeds of kindliness rather than in words. She
had scholarly instincts, rare literary taste, and
constantly took up new studies. In the inter-
vals of a busy life she wrote easily and well.
That her children should excel in authorship
would have been her greatest satisfaction.

Mi,ss Benneson, the youngest of four sisters,
inherited her father's physicjue and her mother's
mental characteristics. She was a stui'dy child,
orderly, accurate, self-reliant, aml)iti(jus, and
persevering. Her mother, who studied all hei-
children, soon perceived that the wisest way to
direct her was as far as possible to answer her
questions exactly and fully and to exi)lain to
her principles and the relation of things. Under
this loving guidance and in the companionship



of her sisters antl a young cousin who was one of
the household, she had a happy childhood. Her
happiness, however, was by no means passive.
Diligent in all the activities that impel healthy
young minds, she wrote ami studied with a zeal
that might have put to shame much older
heads. She had leai'iied to read before the
family knew what she was about, and when she
became ab.sorbed in a book one could call her
name aloud without her hearing it, an experi-
ment fretjuently made by the other children.

The five little girls hail many novel and in-
genious ways of entertaining themselves. One
of their enterprises was the editing of a maga-
zine called The Experiment, which was reatl
aloud every week in the family circle. In its
columns appeared Miss Benneson's first writ-
ings. At eight she contributed a satire on a
fashionable woman's call, entitled "A Visit,"
which won the prize the mothei- had offered, '^o
receive it the embarrassed author had to be
dragged from under the bed, where she had
hidtlen during the reading.

At nine, by her own request, her father al-
lowed her to help keep his books. In his old
ledgers are still to be seen her chiklish figures,
correctly and carefully entered.

At twelve she was reading Latin at sight,
had acquaintance with much of the best litera-
ture, and was industriously collecting and tabu-
lating historical facts. Her mother noted her
ability to get at the pith of an argument and
to sum up a conversation in a few words of her
own. Permitted to take pencil and paper to
church, she drew trees as she listened to the
tliscour.ses, the trunk representing the text, or
main thought, the branches the ideas leading
out from it. In her judgment the merits of a
sermon depended upon whether or not it could
be " treed." At school she easily excelled other
children of her age. At fifteen she had finished
the course at the Quincy Academy, the equiva-
lent of that of a good high school. At eighteen
.she was gratluated from the (|)uincy Seminary.
l'"rom that time until she entered college she
had her full share of social life, of which her
father's hou.se was a hospitable centre.

ing a magnificent view of fourteen miles of the
Mississippi. To Miss Benneson, who was a
good rower and knew everj' inlet and island of
the neighboring river, it was a part of life. She
watched with untiring interest the steamers
plying to and fro between St. Louis and St.
Paul, the flare of the pine torches when they
neared the landings at night amidst the melo-
dious chanting of the negro deck-hands, the
varying moods of the restless stream itself in
sunshine and in storm, its daily busy traffic
and evening glow, and eagerly awaited its su-
preme moment, when it tossed ofT the crashing
ice-blocks in the spring, piling them high along
shore. Whether seen from her windows or
from her boat, the Mississippi had always for
her a personality indelibly associated with her
childhood and youth: it was her unconscious
friend, helping her to think and act.

In the home there was great harmony and
incentive to noble living. The men of note
who were there entertained, especially Alcott
and Emerson, made a great impression on Miss
Benneson, who while still in her teens was in-
clined to philosophic study. Indeed, Emerson
has always been an inspiration to her. One of
her hapjiiest summers was spent at the Old
Manse in Concord, amidst the scenes that he
has immortalized.

When the question of her higher education
was considered, Miss Benneson chose the Uni-
versity of Michigan, then recently opened to
women. She entered with advanced rank, antl
completeil the four years' course in three. The
first college girl to greet her on her arrival in
Ann Arbor was Alice Freeman (afterward Alice
Freeman Palmer), then a Senior. She was one
of a band of earnest women that had assem-
bled frf)m all sections of the country in response
to the new opportunities. They studied hard
and said not much about the great cause for
which they stood, laut the consciousness of it
drew them very closely together. Some have
since become famous. The lives of all have
been the richer for what they there received.
Their friendship and that of the men who stood
loyally by them Miss Benneson regards as one
of the best gifts of her Alma Mater. Her first
public appearance m college was during her
l'"reshman year, in a Homeric controversy, in



which she took the position that Homer wrote
the Iliad, arguing from the internal evidence
of the book. She spoke extemporaneously, at
that time unusual for a woman; and her manner
of presenting argument, then, as always, for-
cible, won the day. In her Senior year she was
elected one of the editors of The Chronicle, the
leading college paper, the first woman to fill
this office.

After receiving the degree of A.B. at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Mi.ss Benneson began the
study of law. It was a deliberate choice. She
was not forced by circumstances to take up a
profession, but it was impossible that her mind
should remain inactive and her life ineffective.
Her choice was not opposed by lier family or
friends. Her application for admission to the
Law School of Harvard University, signed
by five Harvard alunmi, was refused on the
ground that the equipments were too limited
to make suitable provision for receiving women.
It was no detriment to her legal education that
she returned to the University of Michigan,
where she received instruction from Judges
Cooley, Campbell, and Walker, Professors Wells
and Kent, one of the strongest law faculties ever
assembled in America. In her law class, which
numbered one hundred seventy-five, there were
but two women. They had, however, no preju-
dice to encounter. Respect anfl courtesy greeted
them on every hand. Miss Benneson was sec-
retary of her class, presiding officer in the lead-
ing debating society, and judge of the Illinois
Moot Court.

After receivi.ng her higher degrees, LL.B. and
A.M., and being admitted to the bar in Michi-
gan and Illinois, Miss Benneson made a journey
around the world, occupying more than two
years. This was accomplished without a day's
illness, detention, or accident. Starting from
San Francisco in company with a friend, a
Massachusetts woman, she travelled continu-
ally westward, visiting Hawaii, Japan, China,
liurma, India, Arabia, Abyssinia, Egypt, Pal-
estine, Turkey, and all of the principal coun-
tries of I'Airope. I'ar fmni being the ordinary
journey of the ordinary globe trotter, it was an
extended study of the customs, manners, and
laws of many nations. Curiosity is not a
touchstone in foreign travel, but a kindly nat-

uie and human sympathy relax even the sto-
lidity of a Chinaman. Doors opened easily to
Miss Benneson, both those to the home and to
the heart. Where .some would have seen only
odd dress and curious customs, she found the
spirit and motive of the real life. She was able
to discriminate without being critical. The
journey, too, was full of thrilling incidents,
among them a camping expedition in the Yo-
semite; horseback rides over the lava tracts to
the Burning Lakes and down and up the steep
walls of the gulches of Hawaii; the tour of
Canton under English escort at the time of the
Tonquin War; the elephant and dromedary
rides m India and Egypt; the sight of the fa-
mous Highland regiment, the Black Watch,
marching out to battle, and the sound of the
artillery fire of the British squares; a journey
with the pilgrims returning after Easter from
Jerusalem to Damascus; an adventure with
brigands in Greece; the coming unawares upon
the breathing Hermes of Praxiteles just un-
earthed ; the mountain climbing in Switzerland ;
the exploration of the Norwegian fjords.

Miss Benneson has the distinction of being
one of the few that have visited the law courts
of all of the principal civilized countries as well
as their chief governing assemblies.

Upon her return, Miss Benneson lectured on
her travels — first in her native city, where she
gave an account of her entire journey, speak-
ing seventeen times consecutively to deeply in-
terested audiences; afterward in St. Paul, Min-
neapolis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston, and
many other cities. Her lectures, everywhere
well attended, were found instructive by those
who had travelled as well as by those who had
not, for with her trained mind and keen per-
ception she was able to give an interpretation
as well as a narration of facts.

In 1886 Miss Benneson edited for a time the
Law Reports of the West Publishing Company
at St. Paul, Minn. In 1887 she accepted a call
to a fellowship in history at Bryn Mawr College,
where she remained until June, 1888. The fol-
lowing September she came to Cambridge,
returning not only to the seat of her ancestors,
but unconsciously choosing a location near
Richard Park's first house. She is environed
by historic and literary associations, being mid-



Way between the Washington Elm and the
Longfellow house, within a stone's throw of
Radcliffe College and in sight of Harvard.

Miss Benneson did not find herself a stranger
in Massachusetts. Kinsmen and old friends
welcomed her. Among the new was Lucy
Stone, in whose home she became a fre-
quent guest, meeting there others of similar
tastes.

In 1894 she was admitted to the bar in Massa-
chusetts, and in the following year was ap-
pointed special commissioner by Governor
Greenhalge.

Various organizations attribute their success
in large measure to the foresight of Miss Benne-
son when framing their constitution and by-
laws, notably the Unity Clubs of Ann Arbor,
Mich., and Quincy, 111., which she founded, the
College Club, and Woman's Club House Cor-
poration of Boston, of which she was incorpo-
rating counsel.

AVhile attending to an ever-increasing prac-
tice, Miss Benneson has been a constant student.
Her contributions to literature on questions
concerning government are of recognized value.
A paper upon " Executive Discretion in the
United States," read before the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science in 1898,
attracted wide attention. That was followed
by one upon " Federal Guarantees for Main-
taining Republican Government in the States."
The Popular Science Monthly in speaking of
this paper said: "No more suggestive title has
ever been presented to such a body." In rec-
ognition of valuable papers contributed, Miss
Benneson was made a fellow of the Association
in 1899, and in 1900 was elected secretary of
the Social and Economic Science Section. An-
other paper on "The Power of our Courts to
interpret the Constitution," also read before
the Association, has led to the announcement
of a book dealing with the same general subject.
Aside from these, articles from her pen have
frequently appeared in various magazines. At
the First International Council of Women, held
at Washington, D.C., 1888, she read a paper on
"College Fellowships for Women," which has
had much influence in increasing their oppor-
tunities for original research. In June, 1899,
she gave the Alumni Poem at the University of

Michigan, and in 19()o tlui Ode of iicr class ul
its annivorsary nieoting.

Notwithstaiidiiif:; lici- professional duties and
her student life, Miss liennesou has not been
indifferent to any luuuan interest. She has
been a keen observer of all the activities of
women, has l)een (juick to deplore any ti'tidency
that would destroy womanliness in the hifjhest
sense and as ready to aid any movement that
would give women a fuller and richer life and
make tliem more efficient members of society.

"The cominfi; woman, " writes Miss Henneson,
"will not hesitate to do whatever she feels will
benefit humanity, and she will develop her own
faculties to the utmost because by .so diiing she
can best .■^erve. t-he will have a home, of cour.se.
She will not marry, however, for the sake of a
home, because she will be seli-supporting. The
home she will liel|) to found will not be for the
.selfish gratihcation of two individuals, but a
centre of light and harmony to all that come
within the sphere of its radiance. Many so-
called duties, that drain the nerve force of the
modern woman, the coming woman will omit
or delegate. One duty she will not delegate —
the character moulding of her children. The
woman of the future comes not to destroy, but
to fulfil the law. She will not confine her in-
fluence to a limited circle. It will be felt in
the nation's housekeeping. AAherever she is
needed there will she be found."

Miss BennesOn believes that reforms cannot
be forced upon society, but must come through
a natural evolution, and that one can do an-
other no more serious injury than to deprive
him of lifjerty of ojiinion and action. Hence
she is never dogmatic or aggressive. Her rule
of conduct, though i)erhaps not .so formulated,
seems to be "to study hard, think (juietly, talk
gently, act frankly, await occasions, hurry
never." From her earliest years her life has
been characterizeil by calmness and delibera-
tion. She carries the burdens of others easily,
and seems to have none of her own.

" Verite sans ))eur" is Miss Benneson's motto,
adopted when she was eighteen yeai's old and
so faithfully adhered to that her fi'iends, seeing
it even on her office; walls, have come to asso-
ciate it with her name. Following truth with-
out fear and seeing the best that is in every



one, she has become to others a constant stim-
ulus to new and high achievement. They can-
not bring into her atmosjjhere what is trifling
or degrading. She ojjens to them a larger life,
helping them by showing them how to help
themselves. Her secret of happy living is to
convert difhculties into blessings by making
them contribute to self-mastery ami spiritual
development.

ELLAC. R. WHITON (Mrs. Royal Whiton)
was born in lirookline, Mass., March 9,
1857, daughter of Alvin A. and Eleanor
J. (Woodbury) Rice. Her father died
in Decembei-, 1S6.5, and her mother in March,
1902.

Ella C. Rice was educated in the public
schools of Boston and Brookline, and early
entered upon a business life. She was married
March 9, ISS7, to Royal ^^'hiton, who was born
July 2S, 1S4(), in Hingham, Mass., son of Royal
and Rebecca A. (Lothrop) Whiton. Mr. WHiiton
is a descendant in the eighth generation of
James Whiton (or Whiting), who was in Hing-
ham as early as 1647.

Mrs. Whiton for a number of years has taken
an active part in club life and philanthropic
work. She was associated for some time with
the workers for the Charity Club Hospital and
later for the Aged Couples' Home and in recent
years with the Dorchester Woman's Club. She
was a charter member of that club, and served
it for five years as treasurer. She did very
efficient work in securing the building of the
beautiful club-house of the Dorchester Woman's
Club House As.sociation, of which from its or-
ganization .she has been the {^resident. This
house, now six years old, was the first woman's
club-house of any importance in Massachusetts,
and has always been managed by women. Its
success has been largely due to Mrs. Whiton's
untiring efforts. Through her skilful financial
management it will begin its seventh year en-
tirely free from debt.

Mrs. Whiton is interested in all well-considered
movements for the public good, and is a re-
sourceful, unselfish, and conscientious worker.
The good of her cause is always her first thought,

and she works with untiring zeal to accomplish
the end in view. Mrs. Whiton has the confi-
dence and esteem of those with whom she has
been so long and ultimately associated in club
work and other benevolent endeavor to which
her life has been devoted.



MARIA WILDER GOING, Depart-
ment President Massachusetts Wo-
man's Relief Corps in 1901, was
born m Littleton, Mass., August 7,
1845, the eldest daughter of Deacon Henry
Tufts and Martha (Wilder) Taylor. Her father,
born in Littleton, July 22, 1816, was the son
of William Taylor, a native of Concord, Mass.,
and Lydia Whitcomb, his wife, whose birth-
place was Littleton. The Taylor family was
of English origin. Mrs. Going's maternal grand-
parents were Harrison and Keziah (Powers)
Wilder, both natives of Sterling, Mass. Some
of her Wilder ancestors were soldiers in the
Revolutionary War. Deacon Henry Tufts Tay-
lor filled many honorable positions in Littleton.
For nineteen consecutive years he was principal
of one of the public schools, and for several
years he served as chairman of the School
Committee. He was recognized as a teacher
of unusual ability and as an earnest, devoted
man, with rare talents for leadership. To his
inspiring mfluence his daughter attributes her
interest in public affairs. He married April
28, 1841, Martha Wilder, of Sterling,' who was
born in that town, April 21, 1817. Settling
in Littleton, they became identified with its
public interests, and were prominent members
of the Unitarian church for fifty-one years.

Mrs. Going was educated in the public schools
of her native town and at Lawrence Academy,
Groton, and soon after her graduation she be-
came a teacher. Inheriting from her pai-ents
an intense love of music, she began its study
when she was only ten years old, and before
reaching her twelfth birthday was organist in
the Unitarian church, which had the first pipe
organ in the town. She sub.sequently devoted
much time to nmsical studies, and in 1890 or-
ganized and equipped an orchestra, of which
she became the managing dii-ector. The mar-
riage of Maria Wilder Taylor and Myron Fran-



cis Going took place on the 25th of December,
1867. Mr. Going is a native of Townsend,
Mass. On October 18, 1861, he enlisted for
three years in the Twenty-sixth Massachusetts
Regiment of Volunteers. At the expiration of
this term of service he was honorably discharged.
He re-enlisted as a private, and was promoted
to Commissary Sergeant. For several years he
has been a member of Abraham Lincoln Post,
No. 11, G. A. R., of Charlestown. This post's
auxiliary, Abraham Lincoln Relief Corps, No.
39, Mrs. Going joined m 1888. After filling
several minor offices in the corps, she was
elected president, and performed her duties in
such a creditable manner that higher honors
in the oi-der were bestowed upon her. As De-
partment Aide, Assistant Inspector, and In-
stalling Officer, she attended many corps meet-
ings in different parts of the State. In 1898
she was elected a member of the Department
Executive Board; in 1899 Department Junior
Vice-President. The following year she became
Senior Vice-President, and at the annual con-
vention in 1901 was unanimously elected De-
partment President.

During her term of office Mrs. Going trav-
elled several thousand miles, participating in
various patriotic assemblies. A summary of
her year's work was given in her address to
the Department Convention held in the Park
Street Church, Boston, in February, 1902.

Referring to Memorial Day, she said; "The
interestmg report of the Department Chaplain
will show that this sacred day was appropri-
ately and universally observed throughout the
State. Our corps, moved by a common im-
pulse, united with their respective posts, in
paying homage to our fallen heroes. As year
by year rolls by, Memorial Day brings to each
of us a deeper and more lasting significance,
not only to the survivors of the Civil War, but
to every loyal citizen of this nation. With
sadness we recount each passing year a diminu-
tion in the rank and file of the Grand Army of
the Republic. . . . While we speak of the brave
and dauntless soldier, let us not forget the gal-
lant sailors who lie so silently sleeping in the
depths of the sea, whose rolling, restless billows
chant their only requiem."

In regard to the strewing of flowers on the



33:^

ocean waves, she added: "I am heartily in
sympathy with the recommendation of Past
National President Mary L. Carr, adopted by
the Nineteenth National Convention, and earn-
estly hope that this beautiful ceremony will be
incorporated, as far as possible, in the memorial
services of every corps in this department."

Among other points touched upon in the
address was the official visit made in Janu-
ary to the Soldiers' Home on Powder-horn
Hill, including the hospital, where battle-
scarretl veterans, worn antl weary, shatteretl
in body and mind, are nursed and cared for.

A tribute to the army nurses was followed
by the reading of a letter, dated Cambridge,
December 31, 1901, addressed to Mrs. Maria W.
Going, Department President Massachusetts
W. R. C, by Fanny T. Hazen, President Army
Nurse Association of Massachusetts, gratefully
acknowledging the generous New Year's gift
of two hundred dollars to that organization.

Mrs. Going also commended the Sons of
Veterans, the Daughters of Veterans, and dis-
cussed in an eloquent and thorough manner
other topics relating to the united work of
the G. A. R. and W. R. C.

She was the recipient of many gifts in appre-
ciation of her devoted labors for the cause, her
administration being recognized as one of great
efficiency. At the public reception held on the
evening of February 12, 1902, when the his-
toric Park Street Church was crowded with
guests, Mrs. Going presided, and in a happy
and dignified manner introilucetl the several
speakers. Among them were the Hon. Rufus
A. Soule, President of the State Senate, antl
the Hon. J. J. Myers, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, who extended the greetings
of the Commonwealth and of Governor Crane;
John E. Gilman, Past Department Conunander
G. A. R., Commissioner of Soldiers' Relief for
the city of Boston, who represented Mayor
Collins; Judge Torrance, of Minnesota, Com-
mander-in-chief of the G. A. R. ; Mrs. Calista
Robinson Jones, National President W. R. C. ;
and prominent officials in Massachusetts.

Mrs. Going was ai)])ointe(l Coun.'^ellor on the
staff of Mrs. Lyman, the incoming Department
President, and is contiiuiing her work for the
order. She served as treasurer of the W. R. C.



table in the Daughters of \'eterans' Fair, held
in Tremont Temple, November, 1902, and dur-
ing the year has performed duties in various
official capacities. She has attended National
Convention for several years as a representative
from Massachusetts, and has served on impor-
tant committees and as a National Aide. Her
cordial manners anil able efforts in the State
and national work of patriotic organizations
have won for her many friends. She is secre-
tary of the Executive Connnittee of Arrange-
ments for the National Convention in Boston,
August (1904), a position of great responsibility;
is a member of the reception, entertainment,
and other conmiittees, and is devoting her time
and talents for the success of this great gather-
ing of patriotic women. Her portrait hangs
upon the walls of the Department headquarters
in Boston, having been presented by Abraham
Lmcoln Corps of Charlestown, in appreciation
of her services.

Mr. and Mrs. Going moved in 1881 from
Charlestown to Somerville, Mass., where they
have since resided. They had one son, Henry
Bertram Going. He was born December 28,
1869, was graduated from the public schools of
Somerville, and afterward was in business with
his father. A great bereavement came to them
in the loss of this beloved son, who passed to a
higher life, November 21, 1903, in the thirty-
fourth year of his age.



ADELAIDE NICHOLSON BLODGETT
/ \ was born in Fitchburg, Mass., Janu-
X ^ 'iry 10, 1847. She is the daughter of
Charles' Nicholson, a sea captain of
the old-fashioned type, a man of integrity
and ability. The son of an officer in the French
army. Captain Nicholson came to this country
from France at the age of twelve. He married
Mary Ann Varney, who was born in Boston,
and who lived at the North End, in former days
the court end of the town, as it has been
called. Captain Nicholson died some twenty
years ago.

Mrs. Blodgett, on her mother's side, is a
descendant of Nicholas Browne, who settled
in Lynn, Mass., before 1638, and a few years
later removed to Reading. He was a Deputy



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



333



to the General Court of Massachusetts m 1641,
1655, 1656, and 1661.

Her great-grandfather, Seth Ingersoll Browne
(WiUiam,' Cornelius,^ Nicholas'), was one of
the "Mohawks" who helped throw the tea
into Boston Harbor, December 16, 1773, and
was a non-commissioned officer m the battle
of Bunker Hill.

Captain and Mrs. Nicholson removing to
Newton when their daughter Adelaide was
a mere child, she received her early etlucation
in the schools of that town, attending later
Maplewood Institute in Pittsfield, Mass. She
married Mr. W. H. Blodgett, a member of the
well-known Boston firm of Joel Goldthwaite
&amp; Co., June 14, 1865, and settled in Newton,
where she has since resided. Mr. and Mrs.
Blodgett have two children, Grace Allen and
William Ernest. The daughter, Grace Allen,
a- graduate of Smith College, is married to Dr.
R. H. Seelye, one of the most skilled surgeons
of Western Massachusetts, and resides in
Springfield, where she is a power in the educa-
tional and moral forces of the comnumity.
William Ernest Blodgett is a graduate of both
Harvard College and Harvartl Medical School.
He is making a specialty of orthopedic surgery.
Mrs. Blotlgett has always been a student,
and, while travelling extensively in Europe
with her children, was as busy with books and
music as they. She has been a member of
the Eliot (Congregational) Church for thirty-
six years, and has given herself with much en-
thusiasm to its needs a«d concerns. She is now
president of the Woman's Home Missionary
Association of Massachusetts and Rhode Islantl.
She was for three years president of the Social
Science Club of Newton, which has for one of
its good works the support of a vacation school
in Nonantum (a manufacturing village in New-
ton) at an outlay of six humlred dollars a year.
She was president of the Newton Federation
of Women's Clubs, and was elected treasurer
of the Massachusetts State Federation of Clubs
at the time of its founding, a position which
she filled for eight consecutive years.

Though Mrs. Blodgett has filled many public
positions admirably, it is in her own home that
she is at her best. It is here that one finds
many evidences of her cultured tastes, and, see-



ing the personality of the mistress, does not
wonder at her power of hiaking and keeping
friends. m. a. s.



CAROLINE YOUNG WENTWORTH,
M.D., Ch.B., of Newton Highlands,
Mass., was born in South Berwick,
Me., being the daughter of Benjamin
F. and Mary Elizabeth (Young) Wentworth.
Her maternal grandmother was a Quaker. On
the paternal side her first ancestor in this coun-
try was Elder William AVentworth, who came
to New England less than twenty years after
the arrival of the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock,
and less than ten years after the arrival of John
Winthrop and the settlement of Boston. In
1639 he was one of the signers of the " combi-
nation" for a government at Exeter, N.H.
Some years later he settled in Dover, N.H.,
where he served as Ruling Elder of the church
and for several years as Selectman. The long
roll of his descendants includes many distin-
guished names, both in colonial and in later
times.

The Wentworth family in England is traced
back to a Saxon land-owner living in Strafford
in the West Riding of Yorkshire in the eleventh
century, and designated in the Domesday
Book as Rynald or Reginald de Wynterwade.
Dr. Wentworth in her girlhood years attended
the public schools of Wakefield, Mass., and
subsequently took the course at the State
Normal School in Framingham. After her
graduation she taught m the public schools of
Newton and in Arthur Oilman's Preparatory
School in Cambridge. In 1895, after a four
years' course of study at the Boston Univer-
sity School of Medicine, she received therefrom
the degree of M.D., having previously taken
(1894) the degree of Ch.B. (Bachelor of Surgery).
She then spent a year as surgical interne in the
Massachusetts Homoeopathic Dispensary, and
has held an. appointment on the surgical staff
of that institution ever since. She is widely
interested in philanthropic movements, and
holds the office of visiting physician in a number
of practical charitable institutions in Boston
and Newton.
Shortly after her graduation Dr. Wentworth

opened an office in Newton Highlands, where
she has built up a large practice. She stands
not only for skill and ability in her profession,
but as an influence for good in the community.



LINA FRANK HECHT has been almost
from the beginning of her residence
^ in the city of Boston the centre of
all philanthropic activity in Jewish
circles.

Born in Baltimore, Md., November 27, 1848,
Lina P&gt;ank was one of eight children, four sons
and four daughters — namely, Sarah, Alexander,
Daniel, Lina (Mrs. Hecht), Emma, Rosa, Abra-
ham, and William — who formed the united
household of Simon and Fanny (Naumburg)
Frank.

The parents, coming from Germany and
building a happy and comfortable home for
their children of the new world, bequeathed to
them nobility of character and a gracious pres-
ence, in which inheritance Lina fully partici-
pated.

On January 23, 1867, she married in Balti-
more Jacob H. Hecht, a promising young mer-
chant. After passing a year in San Francisco,
they took up their residence in Boston, where
Mr. Hecht became a prominent figure in com-
mercial and philanthropic life.

Together they worked not only for the up-
building of the poor of their own faith, but for
the betterment of their city, for State, and for
country. Their names are to be found on the
boards of State and city institutions and on the
membership rolls of nearly every prominent
charitable institution of Boston. They were
blessed with cultivated and artistic appreciation.
Painters and nmsicians found in them generous
patrons, and, with the literary men and women
of our day, often enjoyed the hospitality of
their beautiful home on Commonwealth Av-
enue. Not having any children of her own,
Mrs. Hecht took to her own heart and hearth-
stone five nieces and a nephew, who bear to-day
loving testimony to her sympathetic care and
wise guidance.

Of a profoundly religious nature and religious
training, the holy language that makes "char-
ity" synonymous with "justice" readily finds



expression in Mrs. Hecht's life. AVhile very
faithful to the claims of blood, here benevolence
knows no limit of race, creed, or color. Her
days are given up literally to the noble privi-
lege of ministering to the needs of others.

She has been the active president of the He-
brew Women's Sewing Society since its organi-
zation. This is a society of over five hundred
members, who give personal service in addition
to material comfort to the hundreds of suffering
poor who flock to our shores. The society aims
to make its beneficiaries self-supporting, and,
besides food, clothing, medicine, medical at-
tendance, and "country weeks," has advanced
capital to establish many worthy families in
business.

Mrs. Hecht's fertile brain, her executive
ability, and personal magnetism have all been
called into play to make this society one of the
most prominent women's organizations in the
country, not only because of its far-reaching
and helpful influence, hut by reason also of its
financial standing.

Fourteen years ago, when so many strange
people of strange thought and habit came to
Boston, Mrs. Hecht opened a school to assimi-
late and Americanize the immigrants, in order
that these human beings might not become a
burden upon the Commonwealth, but a part of
it. In her wisdom she realized that the prog-
ress of the world rests upon " the breath of the
school-children," and that they in turn influ-
ence the parents. The Baroness de Hirsch and
Baroness Rothschild both approvetl the plan
when Mrs. Hecht presented it to them in Paris
in 1896, and both became generous contribu-
tors. The citizens of Boston, Jew and non-
Jew, recognized the civilizing and Americaniz-
ing power vested in this institution, called the
Hebrew Industrial School, and also became
subscribers. Mr. Hecht served as treasurer,
and was a liberal patron, believing that there
was no better work than that of helping to make
good citizens and home-makers, as the school
strives to do.

In the death of her husband, February 24,
1903, Mrs. Hecht was deprived of a compan-
ion entirely at one with her in her hopes
and aims, anrl it was a loss felt by all who
came within the influence of his sweet and

kindly nature and the iiuiny benefited by his
generosity.

Born in Hainstadt, grand (Uichy of Baden,
March 15, 1834, Jacol) H. Hecht was one of the
eight children of Mr. and Mrs. Elias Hecht, who
came to this country with their i)arents in 1848,
and settled in Baltimore, Md. As noted above,
the greater part of his business life was spent
in Boston. He held various official positions,
and was a contributing member of nearly all
the charitable institutions of the city. He was
president of the United Hebrew Benevolent
Association of Boston, a director of the German
Aid Society, the first president of the Elysium
Club, and a member of the Bostonian Society
and of the Boston Art Club.

In his will, dated January 30, I'Mi, Mr.
Hecht made many public beciuests. To show
the breadth of his sympathies and the varied
nature of his charities, also his confidence in
his wife's judgment ami in her fidelity to trusts,
a few of its jirovisions may here be mentioned.
A consideral)le sum, not to exceed one hundred
thousand dollars, from the estate she was per-
mitted to apply at her discretion, within a year
from his death, for the benefit of worthy per-
sons who were in need. Mrs. Hecht is also
given the right to devote, if she sees fit, the
income of fifty thousand dollars annually to
the Hebrew Industrial School. Harvard Col-
lege is to receive eventually the sum of ten
thousand dollars as a scholarship fund, prefer-
ably for students of Hebrew parentage, and a
fund of five thousand dollars to be known as
the Hecht fund, the income to be applied to
the Schiff Semitic Museum. Among other be-
quests may be named five thousand dollars
each to the Massachusetts General Hospital
anil A.si30ciated Charities of Boston; five hundred
dollars each to the Benoth Israel Sheltering
Home, the Boston Provident Association, the
National Farm School, Philadelphia, and the
Industrial School for Deformed and Crippled
Children; three hundred dollars each to the
Hebrew Ladies' Helping Hand Association, the
Newsboys' Reading Room, the Charitable Burial
Association, the Boston Y. M. C. A., and the
Y. M. C. U.; one thousand dollars to the Boston
Young Men's Hebrew Association; and two
hundred dollars to the Salvation Army.



Mrs. Hecht is the honorar)' vice-president
of the Jewish Publication Society of Phila-
delphia and a vice-president of the Civil
Service Reform As.sociation. She was vice-
president of the National Council of Jewish
Women, and is now the vice-president of the
New England section of that organization.
She has served for many years as a member
of the board of the W'omen's Educational and
Industrial Ihiion, a position in which her
services have been greatly appreciated. Both
the Hebrew Federated Charities and the As-
sociated Charities of Boston are benefited by
her active participation in their affairs. She
has served on the Ijoard of the Public Bath
Department of the city.

Asitle from personal donations, Mrs. Hecht
has been zealous in raising money for worthy'
causes, and the fairs and entertainments that
she has organized have, through her own un-
tiring efforts ami the enthusiasm she has aroused
in others, brought in phenomenal sums.

Unselfishness is Mrs. Hecht's most marked
characteristic, and her whole life has been
filled with thought and service for others.
Although she forgets herself, her gracious image
is enshrined in many hearts. Her friends enjoy
fier sympathetic temperament and graceful
presence, antl the poor, who are also her friends,
praise her kind heart and generosity.

As the Hebrew matron of old, so "she spread-
eth out wide her open palm to the poor. She
openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law
of kindness is on her tongue.

"Strength and dignity are her clothing; and
she smileth at the coming of the last day. Let
her own works praise her in the gates."



JOSEPHINE ST. PIERRI'] RUFFIN, the
founder and first president of the Woman's
Era Club, of Boston, was born in this city.
The ilaughter of John and Eliza Matilda
(Menhenick) St. Pierre, on the paternal side
she is of mingled French, African, and abo-
riginal American blood, and on the maternal
side is of Engli.sh, or jjossibly Welsh, stock, her
mother having been a native of Bodmin, Corn-
wall, p]ngland. Eliza Matilda Menhenick and
John St. Pierre were married in Boston in 1830

by the Rev. Dr. William Jenks, of the Green
Street Church (Trinitarian Congregational).

Jean Japfiiies St. Pierre, father of John St.
Pierre and grandfather of Mrs. Ruffin, came to
Massachusetts from Martinique probably early
in the nineteenth century, and, settling in
Taunton, married Betsey Hill, of that town.
She, Mrs. Betsey Hill St. Pierre, grandmotlier
of Mrs. Ruffin, was the grand-daughter of an
African prince, who, having been sent by his
father to conduct a gang of slaves to the sea-
coast, was himself kidnapped and brought to
America. Landing in a Northern seaport, he
escaped from his captors, and made his way
to an Indian settlement in the vicinity of
Taunton. Being kindly received, he married
an Indian girl, became a land-owner, and, es-
tablishing a home, reared a family, which was
called by the country people "the royal family."

This history, which has been handed down
from former generations to the pi'esent, is at-
tested in part by ancient land deeds and other
papers, which Mrs. Ruffin has in her jxjsse.ssion.
In one of these time-worn documents the re-
quest is made that the original estate be kept
as a safe refuge for such of the family as shall
be living in the time of a great and bloody
war, foretold by the African-born ancestor as
surely coming to break the bonds of the slave.

It may here be added concerning the invol-
untary but, so far as appears, contented exile,
that in "the sunset of life" he came to be
looked upon as a seer and a prophet, and a
collection of his prophecies was printed in a
pamphlet, a copy of which is kept among the
family papers. The original farm, " Rocky
Woods," of which he was the owner, is still
held and occupied by one of his descendants.
On this farm is the family burial-place.

John St. Pierre was born in Boston. After
his father's death his widowed mother removed
with her little family to a farm, at Blake's
Landing, near the Taunton River, in the town
of that name. Mr. St. Pierre, as above men-
tioned, was married in Boston, and subsequently
for a number of years was engaged in business
as a clothes dealer in this city. His sixth chiUl,
the subject of this sketch, was named for the
Empress Josephine (a native, be it remem-
bered, of the island of Martinique) at the request



of a French lady, her mother's friend, who gave
her a christening robe.

The early education of Josephine St. Pierre,
received mostly in the public schools of Salem,
Mass., was supplemented later by instruction
from private tutors in New York. For a few
months she was a pupil in the Franklin School,
Boston. While still of school age, she was
married to George Lewis Ruffin, who has been
described as "one of the handsomest and ablest
colored men in Boston."

Mr. Rufiin was born December 16, 1834, in
Richmond, Va., of free colored parents, who
were eilucated and were possessed of some
means. In 1853 the family removed to Bos-
ton. He here attended the Chapman Hall
School. Some years later he studied law in
the office of Jewell &amp; (laston, and in 1869 he
was graduated from the Harvard Law School.
He servetl as a member of the House in the
State Legislature in 1870 and 1871 and as a
Councilman of Boston in 1876 and 1877. In
November, 1883, he was appointed by Governor
Butler Judge of the municipal court of Charles-
town, being the first colored man to be apjiointed
on the bench north of Mason and Dixon's line.
This position he held, "serving with fidelity
and eflnciency," until his death on November
19, 1886.

To Mr. and Mrs. Ruffin were born four chil-
dren: Hubert St. P., Florida Yates, Stanley,
and George L. The death of Judge Ruffin was
followed in a few years by that of his eldest
son, Hubert St. P., who was a member of the
Suffolk bar. Fitted for college at the Boston
Latin School, Hubert St. Pierre Ruffin entered
Harvard in the class of 1882, and on leaving
college studied law with his father. At the
Latin School, as testified by one who was in
the same class with him, "his keen wit, genial
disposition, and chivalric courage made him a
favorite with the boys; while his high scholar-
ship, displayed distinctly in the beauty and
exactitude of his translations from the classics,
won for him the admiration and esteem both
of his classmates and instructors. Mr. Ruffin
was in learning and natural abilities eminently
fitted for the profession which he chose. Skil-
ful and ready in debate, c[uick in repartee, and
eloquent and logical in argument, he meriteil



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



337



the distinction which was his, of being one of
the best young lawyers at the Boston bar."

Florida Yates Ruffin was graduated from the
Boston High and Normal Schools, and was the
second colored woman to receive an appoint-
ment as teacher in the public schools of Boston.
She is now the wife of U. A. Ridley and the
mother of two children. As the first secretary
of the Woman's Era Club and one of its leading
members, she aided her mother in making a
great success of the first convention of colored
women in the country.

Stanley Ruffin, a graduate of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology and an inventor,
is the general manager and treasurer of a man-
ufacturing company in Boston.

George L. Ruffin, the youngest son, is a
graduate of the English High School of Boston.
He has marked musical ability, and for some
years he was a boy soprano at the Church of
the Advent. He is a member of the vested
choir of Trinity Church, Boston, has been a
member of the Handel and Haydn Society and
of the Cecilia Musical Society, and is now the
organist of St. Augustine's Church, Boston.

At an early age Mrs. Ruffin became iden-
tified with reform movements: the advance-
ment of woman and the welfare of the colored
race, especially of the children, were (juestions
that strongly appealed to her sympathies. At
the time when, after the close of the Civil War,
many colored people were fleeing from oppres-
sion in the South and pouring into Kansas,
often arriving in destitute circumstances, she
called the women of her neighborhood at the
West End together for the purjxxse of devising
ways and means of helping the needy refugees.
An organization was formed, named the Kansas
Relief Association, of whicli she was made presi-
dent. Under her direction and aided by the
wise counsels of William Lloyd (iarrison, work
was immediately begun, and carried forward
with zeal and alacrity, resulting in the shipment
to Kansas of many bales and boxes of clothing,
both new and old, and also in the sending
of money through Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.

Success in this philanthropic effort led to
co-operation with the A.ssociated Charities, then
just starting in Boston, Mrs. Ruffin acting as
a visitor for about eleven years. She also



joined in the work of the Country Week So-
ciety, devoting herself to the task, considered
exceptionally difficult, of finding places in the
country for colored chiklren.

Mrs. Ruffin has been for many years an ac-
tive member of the Massachusetts Moral Edu-
cational A.ssociation and of the Massachusetts
School Suffrage Association and a member
of the executive board of each. As editor of
the Woman's Era, she has the privilege of
membership in the New England Woman's
Press Association. The Woman's Era (now
dormant, December, 1903, but with hopes of
being revived) was the organ of the colored
women of America, and exerted an influence
that was widely recognized.

Mrs. Ruffin was one of the founders of the
Association for the Promotion of Child-training
in the South, which has accomplished good re-
sults. It is interested in a school at Atlanta,
Ga., among whose regular visitors were several
prominent women of that State.

As the first president of the Woman's Fa-a
Club of Boston, Mrs. Ruffin has gained a na-
tional reputation. This club was formed "for
colored women and by colored women, to the
end that problems of vital interest to the col-
ored jjopulation might be discussed." From
the beginning the club evinced a progressive
spirit, and the meetings were full of interest.
Mrs. Ruflin is an able woman, well read, keen-
witted, pleasing in manner, and has the uplift-
ing of the colored race sincerely at heart. She,
more than any other woman, formed the club,
and much of the success is due to her good
sense and enterprise.

In L'^QS it was decided to hoUl a national
convention of colored women in Boston. This
convention was decitledly interesting, ami the
outcome was the formation of a federation of
colored women's clubs. Since 1895 the W^oman's
Era Club has been connected with the Massa-
chusetts State Federation, and its president
has participated in the sessions of the State
conference. Mrs. Ruffin has also been elected
a member of the Massachusetts State Federa-
tion and an officer on its boartl.

The Woman's Era Club continues its meet-
ings twice each month, and a few white women,
who were cordially welcomed to membership,



338



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



have participated in its deliberations. " We
never drew a color line," said one of the mem-
bers. Mrs. Hannah C. Smith, former corre-
sponding secretary, states that its object is
educational rather than benevolent, but that
it has \mdertaken a number of philanthrojjic
plans and carried them tlirough successfully.
Several scholarships in colored educational in-
stitutions have been purchased, and in this
way many who would not have l)ad an educa-
tion otherwise have been provide&lt;l for. At
the outset the club was divided into several
classes and each placed under the direction of
a leader. These classes discu.ssed civics, do-
mestic science, literature, public improve-
ments, and questions of importance to the col-
ored race! Circulars written by members of
the club uj)on important questions have been
issued, and numerous copi&lt;^s circulated. Money
has been raised and expended, which has aided
in promoting the welfare of the colored race in
Boston and other cities. Assistance has also
been given to worthy charities.

In 1900 the club accepted an urgent invita-
tion to join the General Federation, and their
application was forwarded by the State secre-
tary. Mrs. R. D. Lowe, president, promptly
returned a certificate of membership, and offi-
cially expressed her pleasure at the action of
the club. It was then entitled to be repre-
sented at the biennial convention of the Na-
tional Federation at Milwaukee, Wis., in June,
1900. Mrs. Ruffin was chosen its delegate.
She journeyed to Milwaukee as a representa-
tive also from the New England Woman's
Press Association and from the Massachusetts
Federation of Women's Clubs. The progranune
conmiittee of the National FediM'ation refused
to allow Mrs. Ruffin to appear before the con-
vention and extenil greetings. She was de-
nietl recognition as a delegate, notwithstanding
the elo(iuent pleadings of rej)resentatives from
many States. Telegrams armouncing this de-
cision were sent to all parts of th(&gt; country,
and hunilnnls of editorials were ]nil)lished by
the press, conmientiiig on the subjcci, whicli
had become one of national interest. Many
protests were officially promulgated by local
clubs, and some' have witlidiawn from the
Federation.



Throughout all this discussion Mrs. Ruffin
has maintained an attitude of womanly dignity,
and has the cordial sympathy and regard of
thousands of friends.

In November, 1900, the Woman's Era Club
issued an official statement of the whole mat-
ter, addressed to the members of clubs of the
Ceneral Federation, its conclusion being .summed
up as follows. Could anything Ije clearer tljan
the logic of their jjosition?

"The General Federation of Women's Clubs
has no color line in its constitution. There is
nothing in its constitution, in its oft-published
statement of ideas and aims, in its supposed ad-
vanced positifin upon humanitarian ([uestions,
to lead any club, with like aims and views, to
imagine itself ineligible for membership. The
A\'onian's P&gt;a Club having been regularly ad-
mitted, no legal or moral ground can possibly
be found upon which it could be ruthlessly
thrown out at the pleasure of a few individuals."

The action taken by the General Federation
at the biennial convention lield at I^os Angeles
in May, 1902, was such as to render it practi-
cally impossible for any coloretl club to .secure
recognition. The reply of the Woman's Era
Club to (juestions in regard to its status in
1903 is this:—

"It stands just as it stood before, and just
as it would have stood had the reorganization
plan been carrietl tlirough successfully. As a
part of the State Federation, it has member-
ship in the general body; as an individual club,
it has all the legally executed documents which
eminent legal authority declare justifies our
club in considering itself as much an individual
member of the G. F. W. C. as any other cluli
in that bodv" (Annual Report of the AVoinan's
Era Club fo'r 1902-1903).

".hme 1, 1903, the annual meeting was held,
and for the first time in the histor}' of the club
there was a change in presidents.

"The retiring president, Mrs. Josephine St. P.
Ruffin, foun(l(&gt;r of the club, has for eleven con-
tinuous and harmonious years occupied the
l)osition of club president, with honoi' not only
to herself and its members, but to the whole
race. She positively decrmcil anf)ther re-elec-
tion becau.se of the prej^siu'e of other work. In
her retirement the club keenlv feels its loss;



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



339



and, to assuage to an extent tliis feeling and
retain a claim upon her ability and foresight,
and still to have her valuable aid and counsel,
tlie clulj voted to create for her the position
of honorary president with active rights.

"The newlv elected officers for the year
190:M904 are: President, Mrs. Hannah Ciike
Smith; First Vice-President, Mrs. R. C. Richard-
son; Recording Secretary, Mrs. M. Cravatt
Simpson; Corresponding Secr(&gt;tary, Mrs. K. T.
Moore; Treasurer, Mrs. E. Taylor-Cotton; Au-
ditor, Mrs. M. E. Wingfiekl." "

The report shows that the Woman's Era
Clul) continued its useful activities during 1902-
1903 with good results, that year being pro-
nounced the most successful in the club's ex-
istence. One thing upon which the club justly
congratulated itself in the report was the
"l)rfimineiit part it had taken in promoting
the gootl work of enlarging Mrs. Sharpe's home
school in Liberia." Of the American Mount
Coffee School Association, formed in January,
1903, to aid this school, Dr. Edward Everett
Hale was chosen president and Mrs. Ruffin a
vice-presitlent.

In the same season Mrs. Ruffin delivered her
lecture on " Moral Corn-age as a Factor in Social
Regeneration" before the Revere Woman's
Club, the Lynn Suffrage Club, the Ladies' Phys-
iological Listitute, the Jersey City Heights
Club, anil in the West.



MARTHA ELIZABETH FOSS MANN,
M.D., a well-established medical
practitioner in Boston, was born
in this city, March 9, 1848,
daughter of Charles Meade and Martha Eiiz-
al:&gt;eth (Hatchman) Foss. Her father, who
was for many years a prosperous jeweller in
Boston, came of the old New Hampshire Foss
family. Dr. Mann's great-gram If ather Foss
was a Revolutionary soldier, enlisting at Rye,
N.H., and serving under General Stark at
the battle of Bennington. At the cIo.se of the
war he took u|i laml in Meredith, N.H., where
he subsecjueutly resided until his death.
A maternal ancestor, John Hatchman, was also
a Revolutionary soldier; and through these
valiant and patriotic men Dr. Mann holds mem-



bership in the Daughters of the American Revo-
lution, belonging to Boston Tea Party Chapter.

The subject of this sketch was educated in
the public schools of Boston and at one of the
leading private schools, where, after being
graduated from the high school, she continued
her studies for four years.

On February 22, 1871, she married Dr. Ben-
jamin Houstcjn Mann, a graduate of the Har-
vard Medical School and a soldier in the Twenty-
fourth Massachusetts Infantry tluring the Civil
War. Four children we're born of this marriage,
all sons, namely: Benjamin Percy, November
9, 1871; Charles Foss, April 23, 1873, who died
April 4, 1877; Houston, December 31, 1875;
and Arthur Meade, February 5, 1879.

In 1881 Dr. Benjamin H. Mann died; and
his widow, with her three children, returned
to her father's home. Deciiling to adopt the
medical profession, she enteretl Boston Uni-
versity in 1882, received her degree in 1885,
and immediately began practice in Boston.
For seven years she was the assistant of the
eminent Dr. Horace Packard in his private
practice and hospital work. Dr. Mann has
served for five years as secretary of the Boston
Homoeopathic Medical Society, was vice-presi-
dent of the Boston Gynaecological Society, was
president of the Twentieth Century Medical
Society, is a member of the American Institute
of Homoeopathy and of the Massachusetts
Homoeopathic Medical Society, and is instructor
and lecturer at Boston University.

From her youth Dr. Mann has been a mem-
ber of the Congregational church, but she at-
taches more importance to daily works than to
creed. Though possessing much natural apti-
tude for her {)rofession, which was fostered by
her association with her husband, her success
has been due to concentration of purpose and
unceasing labor rather than to any fortuitous
circumstances.



SARAH BRADLEE FULTON, in whose
memory the Medford (Ma.ss.) Chapter
of the Daughters of the American Rev-
olution is namei!, was a native of Dor-
chester, Mass. Her ttrst known paternal an-
cestor was Nathan' Bradley, .sometimes called



340



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Nathaniel, who was born in 1631. In 1668
Nathan' Bradley owned two acres of the
"Great Lots," and in 1680 he was sexton of the
town of Dorchester. His duties as sexton were
to " ring the bell, cleanse the meeting-house,
anil carry water for baptism." While the bell
stood on the hill, he was to have "£4 a year
and after the bell is brought to the meeting
house, £3 lO*." He died July 26, 1701. By
his wife Mary, daughter of Richanl Evans,
of Dorchester, he had six children, his eldest
son being Nathan,^ born March 12, 1674-5.
Samuel,^ son of Nathan^ Bradley by his second
wife, Lydia, spelled his name Bradlee. He
was a weaver and fisherman. He married
Mary Andrus, February 11, 1730, and in 1753
removed from Dorchester to Boston.

To Samuel' and Mary (Andrus) Bradlee was
born December 24, 1740, a daughter, Sarah,
the subject of this sketch. In 1767 Sarah
Bradlee married John Fulton, of Boston,
son of John Fulton and his wife, Ann Wire
(or Weir). They had ten children, the third
of whom was Ann Weir, the tenth Elizabeth
Scott. Of the other eight the following is a
brief record : Sarah Lloyd married Nathan Wait,
of Medford; John Andrus, whose first wife
was Mehetabel Owen, and his second, Harriet,
resided in New London, Conn.; Mary died
young; Lydia married John Bannister, of Bos-
ton; Frances Burns married Thomas Tilden,
of Boston; Mary (second) married David Gush-
ing, and resided in Hull, Mass. ; Samuel Bradlee
married Mary Barron, of Boston; Lucretia
Butler married Samuel Smallidge, and resided in
East Cambridge, Mass.

A sketch of Sarah Bradlee Fulton, written
by Miss Helen T. Wild, Regent of the chapter
bearing her name, was read at one of its meet-
ings. It has been published in the American
Monthhi Magazine, Washington, D.C., and in
the Medford Historical ReijiMtr. It is an inter-
esting story of her patriotic services, and is
herewith reprinted : —

"SARAH BRADLEE FULTON.

"DoncHESTKR, 1740. Mkpford, 1835.

"The names of the men who fought in the
war of the American Revolution are carefully



preserved in the archives of the State, luit the
women who through all those sad years en-
dured hardship and loss, and who toiled at
the spinning-wheel and in the hospitals for
their country's cause, have long ago been
forgotten. Only here and there a woman's
name is found on the roll of honor of Revolu-
tionary days.

" Among the Metlford women whom history
has remembered, Sarah Bradlee Fulton has a
prominent place. We have been proud to
name our chapter for her, honoring with her
all the unknown loyal women who worked in
this dear old town of ours for the cause of lib-
erty.

" Mrs. Fulton was a member of the Bradlee
family of Dorchester and Boston. In 1767
she married John Fvilton, and ten years later
they came to Medford with their little sons and
daughters, and made their home on the east
side of Main Street, about one hundred and
fifty feet south of the bridge, on the south side
of what is now Tufts Place. Her lirother,
Nathaniel Bradlee, lived in Boston, at the
corner of Tremont and Hollis Streets. His
carpenter's shop and his kitchen, on Saturday
niglits, when friends and neighbors gathered
to enjoy his codfish suppers, were meeting-
places for Boston's most devoted patriots.
From this shop a detachment of Mohawks
who 'turned Boston Harlior into a teapot'
went forth on their work of destruction. In
the kitchen Mrs. Bradlee antl Mrs. Fulton dis-
guised the master of the house and several
of Ills comrades, and later heated water in the
great copper boiler, and provided all that was
needful to transform these Indians into re-
spectable Bostonians. Natl^aniel Bradlee's
principles were well known; and a spy, ho])ing
to find some proof against him, i)eered in at
the kitchen window, but saw these two women
moving about so ciuietly antl naturally that
he passed on, little dreaming what was really
in ])rogress there.

" A year and a half later Sarah Fulton heard
the alarm of Paul Revere as he 'crossed the
bridge into Medford town,' and a few days
after the place became the headquarters of
General Stark's New Hampshire regiment.
Then came the battle of Bunker Hill. All

day the people of Medfonl watched the battle
with anxious hearts: many a son and brother
were there— dying, maybe, just out of their
reach. At sunset the wounded were brought
into town, and a large open space by Wade's
Tavern, between the bridge and South Street,
was turneil into a field hospital. Surgeons
were few, but the women did their l)est as mu'ses.
Among them the steady nerves of Sarah Fulton
made her a leader. One poor fellow had a
bullet in his cheek, and she removed it. She
almost forgot the circumstance until, years
after, he came to thank her for her service.

" During the siege of Boston, detachments
of British soldiers often came across the river
under protection of their ships, .searching for
fuel in Metlford. One day a loail of wood
intended for the troops at Cambridge was ex-
])ected to come through town, and one of these
bantls of soldiers was there before it. Sarah
Fulton, knowing that the wooil would be lost
unless something was done, and hoping that
private jjroperty would be respecteel, sent her
husband to meet the team, buy the load, and
bring it home. He carried out the first part
of the {programme, but on the way to the house
he met the soldiers, wht) seizetl the wood.
When his wife heard the story, she flung on a
shawl and went in pursuit. Overtaking the
})arty, she took the oxen by the horns ami turned
them round. The men threatenetl to shoot
her, but she .shouted ilefiantly, as she started
her team, 'Shoot away!' Astonishment, ad-
miration, and amusement were too much for
the regulars, and they unconditionally sur-
rendered.

"Soon after Major Brooks, later our hon-
ored Governor, was given despatches by Gen-
eral Washington which must be delivered in-
side the enemy's lines. Late one night he
came to John Fulton, knowing his patriotism
and his intimate knowledge of Boston, and
asked him to undertake the trust. He was
not able to go, but his wife volunteered. Her
offer was accepted. A long, lonely, and dan-
gerous walk it was to the waterside in Charles-
town, but she reached there in safety, and,
finding a boat, rowed across the river. Cau-
tiously making her way to the place she sought,
she delivered her ilespatches, ami returned as



she had come. \\'heu the first streak of dawn
appeared, she stood safe on her own door-
stone. In recognition of her services General
Washington visited her. It is said that, ac-
cording to the fashion of the day, John Fulton,
on this occasion, brewed a potation whose
chief ingredient was the far-famed jiroduct of
the town. The little silver-mounteil ladle
was dipped in the steaming concoction, and
the first glass from Mrs. Fulton's new punch-
bowl was sipped by his Excellency. This was
the proudest day of Sarah Fulton's life. The
chair in which he sat and the punch-bowl and
ladle were always sacred, and are still treas-
ured by her descendants.

" Years after. General Lafayette was her
guest, and we can safely say he was .seated in
General Washington's chair, served with punch
from the same jjunch-bowl, and entertained
with the story of that memorable visit.

"Sarah Fulton was never afraid of man or
beast: as .she once told her little grandson,
she 'never turned her back on anything.' Her
strength of mind was matched by her streitgth
of body. After the Revolution she made her
home on the old road to Stoneham, which at
the first town meeting after her death was
named Fulton Street in her honor. More than
a mile from the square, the cellar of the house
can still be seen, and many Medford people
remember the building itself.

"In spite of the long distance Sarah Fulton,
even in extreme old age, was in the habit of
walking to and from the I'nitarian church every
Sunday. Those who knew her could scarcely
comprehend that she hatl passed fourscore
and ten years.

" Her humble home was always hospitably
open, especially to the children of her brothers,
who, if they could leave the luxury of their
own homes and come to Medford for a visit,
felt their happiness was complete. She saw
grandchildren and great-grandchildren grow
up arounil her, ami in the atmosphere of their
love and reverence she spent her last days.
One night in November, 1835, a month before
her ninety-fifth birthday, she lay down to sleej),
and in the morning her daughters found her
lying with a peaceful smile on her face, dead.
They laid her in the old Salem Street Cemetery,

and there she sleeps, among her old friends and
neighbors.

"Patriotism, courage, and righteousness
were among her possessions."

A chapter of the Daughters of the American
Revolution named in honor of Mrs. Fulton
was organized in Medford, December 17, 1896,
with seventeen memlM-rs. Its charter was
presented January 26, 1897. The first officers
were: Regent, Mrs. Mary S. Cioodale; Vice-
Regent, Mrs. Mary B. Loomis; Secretary, Miss
Helen T. Wild; Registrar, Mrs. Enmia W.
Goodwin; Treasurer, Miss Adeline B. Gill;
Historian, Miss Eliza M. Gill.

During Mrs. Goodale's administration a tab-
let was erected to mark the site of the home
of Mrs. Fulton during the Revolution. During
the Spa^iish War the members of the chapter
were active in work for the soldiers. They
gave liberally of time, work, and money to
assist the enlisted men of Medford, and also
contributed to the Massachusetts ^'olunteer
Aid Association.

December 5, 1898, Mrs. Mary B. Loomis
was elected Regent. During her term of
office the chapter erected a memorial in the
Salem Street Cemetery, Medford, to mark the
last resting-place of Mrs. Fulton. The stone
used was the doorstep of the hou.se on Fulton
Street where she lived for many years anil
where she died. It is inscribed: —

Sarah Bradlee Fulton,
a heroine of the revolution.

1900.

In April, 1899, a loan exhibition was held
by the chapter in the Royal House, Medford,
which was attended by a large number of
persons from far and near. The proceeds
enabled the ladies in 1901 to open the Royal
House to the public for a ixTmanent exhibition.
They also published a descriptive jiamphlet
relating to it. The house also is the head-
(piarters of the chai)ter. The mansion, which
is a fine example of colonial architecture, was
remodelled by Isaac Royall in 1732, and it
is known to have existe&lt;i in a plainer form as



early as 1690. During the siege of Boston
it was the headquarters of the New Hampshire
division of the Continental army.



FRANCI'^S LAUGHTON MACE, one of
the best beloved poets of Maine, was
born in Orono, on January 15, 1836.
She died at Los Gatos, Cal., July 20,
1899. She was a daughter of Sumner Laugh-
ton, M.D., and his wife, Mary A. Parker Laugh-
ton. Dr. Lauglit(m was a ibhysician of excel-
lent standing in his profession. He removed
to Foxcroft when Frances was a year old, and
removed thence with his family to liangor when
she was about fourteen. She had already made
excellent i)rogress in the schools of Foxcroft,
reading all the iEneid of Virgil and his Bucolics
at twelve and thirteen, and writing much under
the tutelage and with the encouragement of
both friends and teachers.

The principal of the Foxcroft Academy at
the time she was a student there was Mr.
Thomas Ta.sh, afterward of Portland, and of
much ability as a teacher, well-known in Maine
educational circles. He gave her work not only
close and friendly criticism, but warm apjire-
ciation. "It was he," she said long after-
ward, "who gave me courage to persevere."

In Bangor she continued her studies at the
high school, completing the course at sixteen,
and with private teachers. She was always an
eager and diligent student, and her thorough-
ness and zeal are evidenced in her themes
themselves and in her often lavish use of classic
allusion and imagery. Her first verses were
printed in the Waterville Mail when she was
only twelve years old. It was not long be-
fore her poems began to attract attention, and,
some of them coming under the eye of the editor
of the New York Journal of Conunerce, she was
invited to contribute to that paper. The series
of poems published in that journal includes
some of the loveliest and most significant of
her minor verse.

In 1855 she was married to Mr. Benjamin ?I.
Mace, a lawyer of Bangor, where they resided
till the hope of firmer health for both induced
their removal to San Jose, Cal.

The twoscore and more of years of Mrs. Mace's



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



343



life in Bangor after her marriage were very
fruitful years. Notwithstanding the cares of
her home and of the eight little ones who came
to gladden it (four of them living, to go with her
to the Californian home), she was still an in-
defatigable student. Her vocation as poet was
to her, as Mrs. Browning had said of her own
calling long before, "a serious thing." Every-
thing that could contribute to the enrichment
and tlignity of her poetry was made to yield
^ts revenues: classic story and local legend alike
were woven into it. She was constantly seek-
ing its betterment and continually increasing
the stores of knowledge and association which
should enhance its charm.

Mrs. Mace's work is very strongly localized.
Indeed, by far the best known and best loved
of her poems have their roots deep in home
soil. Her sweetest lyrics are those which crys-
tallize some intimate experience or a.ssociution
of her own. Choice as is the workmanslii}) of
her longer and more studied poems, it is the
slighter and more spontaneous ones that win
and hold the affection.

This is strikingly evident in her first volume,
"Legends, Lyrics, and Sonnets," published in
1883. The tenderness, the serenity, the satis-
fied affection, the moral and spiritual elevation
of the.se poems, impress one throughout the
book. All the loves her life had known, with
all the fruition of them, are garnered in this
little gray-garbed volume; and her fame would
have been secure in it had she never written
more.

Although this collection includes some of the
most spontaneous of her minor verse, antl though
it is by these lyrics rather than by her longer
poems that she is most lovingly remembered,
the book held, too, work that conunanded the
attention of the wider and more critical world
outside her immediate circle of friends or her
accvistomed readers. "Israfil," one of the
longest and most finished poems in the volume,
was published in Harper s Magazine in 1877.
It is one of the strongest and stateliest of her
poems, and is instinct with a profound and in-
sistent faith. Many of the poems in this and
in the succeeding volume were suggested by the
scenery and associations of the Mount Desert
region, and will link her fame with its own.



In this volume are printetl the well-known
verses, "Only Waiting." This tender lyric was
written when she was a girl of eighteen, and
was first published in 1854 in the Waterville
Mail, appearing with the signature "Inez." It
has since been printed in many hooks of sacred
song. That it travelled far and touched many
hearts is shown by the fact that Mrs. Mace re-
ceived letters of gratitude for its consolation
from every State and Territory in the Union.
Despite the irrefragable proofs that attest her
own writing, her claim to its authorship was at
one time disputed. It is pleasant to know that
Dr. James Martineau, having included "Only
Waiting" in his " Hynms of Praise and Prayer,"
gave her, in the second edition, credit for it,
and wrote Mrs. Mace a most cordial letter of
ajjpreciation.

A second volume of poems was published in
1887, with the title, " Under Pine ami Palm."
These verses are of great sweetness and pathos.
The lines of dedication, in which she say.s — with
a touching allusion to a haltit of her girlhood,
that of turning at once to her nearest and dear-
est ones with each "poem as it was completed —
she comes to

" Read once more
My latest verse to those who loved me first,"

are exceedingly graceful and tender. And only
a little less wistful are "The Woods of Maine,"
from which we make (juotation here:—

" To all the wide, wild woods of Maine
The singinj; birds have come again;
In thickets dense and skyward bough
Their nests of love are builded now;
And daybreak hears one blithesome strain
From ail the wide, wild woods of Maine.

■' In all the deep, green woods of Maine
The myriad wild flowers wake again;
On mossy knoll, by whispering rill,
Their new life opens, shy and still;
Unseen, unknown, as spring days wane,
They sweeten all the woods of Maine.

" The fair and fragrant woods of Maine!
To dwellers far on shore and plain
The forest's breath of healing flows
In every wandering wind that blows;
And life throbs fresh in every vein
Where bloom the boundless woods of Maine."

The book opens with a long poem, "The Heart
of Katahclin," suggesting the very atmosphere
of Maine's kingUest mountain. Following it
are a series of lyrical memories, seven in num-
ber, entitled "Midsunuiier on Mount Desert."
The .collection includes also tlie poem read at
tlie unveiling of the copy of the W(&gt;stmiiister
Abbey bust of the jtoet Longfellow in Port-
land, "Me., in LSSf).

The second half of the volume contains
jjoems written fluring her residence in Califor-
nia, in many instances suggested by its scenery,
its associations, and especially by its beauty
and ])romise. Such poems as "The New Italv,"
"Los Angeles," "Mount Hamilton," and "Ves-
pers at San Juan" show her quick intuition of
the forces around her and her swift divination
of the future they were sha|)ing. Yet it is evi-
dent that her thoughts were always straying
to more familiar tilings and to remembered
scenes.

And it came to pass that out of this longing
remembrance of home, out of the sorrows that
one after another came to her in these later
years, and out of the long (piiescence of a linger-
ing physical helplessness, of which one or two
of her later poems give most i)athetic reminder,
there were born a nol)le patience, a serene and
sufficing trust, a larger and devouter thought,
hallowing all that she had wrought before.

KATHERINE MAY RICKER, one of
the most ])opular of the younger
contralto singers of New England,
is a member of one of the oldest
and best known families of Maine, the Rickers
of Poland Springs. They are of "ancient
lineage, descending from the feudal and knightly
family of Riccar in Saxony in the fourteenth
century." The motto of the Riccar arms
(now in the possession of the Poland Sjirings
branch and said to be well attested) was
"Sai)ientia domun Dei," "Wisdom the gift
of God." Members of this Saxon family
settled in later times on the Island of Jersey,
whence came George and Maturin Riccar,
brothers, the ancestors of most, if not all,
of the name in America, a numerous and



widely scattered progeny. George, the elder
brother, was the first to come, advised, it
is believed, by Parson Reyner. He settled
at Cocheco, now Dover, N.H., about the
year 1670. Maturin, from whom is descended
the subject of this sketch, followed a few
years later. Both married here, and reared
families, George being the father of nine
children and Maturin of at least four. They
lived near together in garrison houses on
Dover Point.

Tradition has it that they were greatly
attached to each other, each frequently de-
claring that he did not want to know of the
other's death. The Indians, so the story
runs, planned to kill them both, and accord-
ingly lay in wait for them one morning, one
at each house. Hearing the shot that killed
his brother, the other ran to the door and
was himself instantly shot, so that they tlied
within five minutes of each other. The "Jour-
nal of Rev. John Pike," minister in Dover
at that time, relates the incident somewhat
differently, recording under date of June
4, 1706: "George Riccar and Maturin Riccar
of Cocheco were slain by Indians. George
was killed while running up the lane near
the garrison; Maturin was killed in his field, and
his little son Noah carried away." The first
narrative, however, is that ]iassed down the
line by Jabez Ricker, the grandson of Maturin.
Noah, the child captured, was taken to Canada,
where he became a Catholic priest. After
the massacre of the brothers their families
left Dover P«int, and went to Garrison House
Hill in Somersworth, N.H., there being seven
garrison houses near together.

Miss Ricker's line of descent from Maturin'
is through Joseph," Jabez,' Wentworth,^
Albert G.'' (born in 1812, married Charlotte
Schillinger, of Poland), and Wentworth Pottle"
Ricker, her father (a cousin of the Rickers
of Poland Spring House), who married Dorcas
Ann Merrill, daughter of Leonard Merrill,
one of the influential men of Falmouth and
a descendant of Cajitain James Merrill, who
settled there early in the eighteenth century.
The old homestead, erected in . 1727, was
Miss Ricker's birthplace, and is at present
occujjied by her family.

The stanch patriotism and hberaUty of
James Merrill and his neighbors at New Casco,
as the part of the town where they lived was
called, is shown by the following letter, which,
accompanied b\- fourteen cords of wood,
was sent to 8anmcl Adams, Esq., chairman
of the conmiittoc for the poor of Boston in
the troubled times preceding the outbreak of
the Revolution: —

"March 11, [/"TS. Gentlemen: We herewith
transmit to you by Captain Wormwcll and
Captain Lock some wood, which we cheerfully
give to our suffering brethren that are now
standing in the gap between us and slavery.
We are but few in numbers and of small ability,
and, as we earn our bread by the sweat of
our brow, shall ever hold in utter detestation
both men and measures that would rob us of
the fruits of our toils, and are ready with
our labors, with our lives, and with our estates
to stand or fall in the common cause of liberty.
And if we fall we shall die like men and Chris-
tians and enjoy the glorious privileges of the
sons of Cod.

"This from your humble servants of said
Parish, New Casco: Sanmel Cobb, Nathaniel
Carl, James Merrill."

The sterling qualities exhibited by Captain
Merrill have been transmitted to his descend-
ants, wIkj have been leaders in all matters
of progress and occupied positions of trust.

Miss Rieker received her early education
in the public schools of Falmouth and at
Westbrook Seminary. Her nmsical ability,
inherited from both parents, who were singers
of local reputation and possessed voices of
more than ordinary merit, evinced itself in
childhood. At the age of seventeen she began
vocal culture under Charles R. Adams, of
Boston, remaining one season. Returning
home, she contimied her study with William
H. Dennett, of Portland, to whom she feels
that she owes a great deal of her success.
By his advice she next stutlied with the great
maestro, Olivieri. During her studies with
Mr. Dennett she was engaged as conti'alto
of the Williston choir, remaining until her
departure for Europe in May, LS94. She
was also a member of the afternoon choir
at the Second Parish Church, under Mr.



Kotzschmar. Her hrst public appearance
was in the "Pirates of Penzance," given
by the society people of Portland. Her
wonderful voice and dramatic power came
as a surprise to the large audience, and, although
her part was a minor one, repeated demands
were made for her little solo. The success
of that night was the beginning of her rapiiUy
briglitening career. She was now in demand
at all amateur operas, one of her most popular
roles being Katisha in "The Mikado." While
in Portland she was a memljcr of several
musical clubs and other organizations, among
them being the Haydn (Quartette, wliicli
laecame (piite famous thnjughout Ni'W England,
the Rossini Club, the Haydn Association,
and the Portland Singers' Club. Later she
became a member of tlie McDowell Club
of Boston.

With Mrs. John Rand, Miss Alice Linwood
Philbrook, and Miss Florence G. Knight,
sh(^ was sent to re|)resent tlie Portland Rossini
Club at the Columbian Exposition. They
won for their club a diploma of sjjecial honor
for meritorious work; and, in addition. Miss
Rieker and her cousin. Miss Knight, were
awarded individual diplomas for the most
artistic i^erformance of the whole convention,
the only individual diplomas given to singers.
The awards were made by tw(dve of the lead-
ing musical critics of the world.

Li 1894 she went abroad, beginning her
European study with Signor Vannuccini in
London, contiiuiing under the same master
in Florence and again in London the second
season, when by his advice she studied also
with Signor Randegger in oratorio and English.
While in Europe she received much social
attenti(jn, l)oth in London and in Italy. Ever
since her return to Boston she has tilled the
position which she now holds, that of contralto
in the choir of Central Congregational Church,
one of the best church positions in Boston.
She has also devoted herself to concert and ora-
torio work. At the Maine Musical Festivals of
1S98 and 1900 she sang with D. Ffrangcon
Davies in the oratorio of "Elijah," her success
being only second to his. Her voice is peculiarly
suited to the contralto score of that work.
Another great success was achieved by her



346



REPRESENTATIN E WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



in February, 1S99, when at a few liours' notice
she sang in Mendelssohn's "St. Paul," given
by the Handel and Haydn Society. She
has also sung in Liza Lelunann's " Persian Gar-
tlen" several times. As a concert singer
she is in constant demand, appearing chiefly
in New England.

Gifted with a charming personality, Mi.ss
Kicker has a host of warm friends, social and
musical. She is a true Maine girl, fond of
the place of her birth. Her summers are
spent at the old liomestead, so full of her
childhood's memories.



ADA AIEXANDER ACHORN, D.O.-

/\ Mrs. Achorn was born in .luda, AVis.,
XV March 1, 1S6L Her father, George
W'ashinglon Alexander, of Scotch-
Irish descent, was born in LS21 in Columbus,
Ohio. In LS35 he removed with his father's
family to Indiana. Her mother, who.se maiden
name was Ruth Little, was born in LS23 in
Oxford, Ind.

Mr. and Mrs. Alexander migrating to Iowa
a few years after the birth of their daughter
Ada, she was educated in the public schools
of that State. At the age of seventeen she
began teaching school. This vocation she
followed successfully until her marriage to
Clinton F^dwin Achorn, which took place at
Cherokee, Iowa, January 10, 1882. Mr. and
Mrs. Achorn have one son, Kendall Lincoln
Achorn, born October 20, 1882. He is now
a Senior in the Lawrence scientific department
of Harvard LTniversity.

For several years Mrs. Achorn was enthu-
siastically engaged iii temperance work among
young people, she lieing in the Independent
Order of Gootl Templars, to her the best of all
organizations for its purpose, which she many
times worthily represented in district and State
sessions, and in which she still holds member-
ship. SJie did her first temi)erance work as
a member of the Woman's Christian Tem-
perance LTnion, and she belonged to that so-
ciety until her entire time was needed for her
practice. She is a member of the Woman's
Relief Corps, E. 0. C. Ord Corps, No. 105,
Department of Iowa, which she repeatedly



served in the capacity of treasurer, secretary,
and president. She also belongs to the Daugh-
teis of the American Revolution, Dorothy Dix
Chapter, Waltham, Mass., deriving her title
to membership through her descent from
Joseph Alexander, her father's paternal grand-
father, who enlisted at Simsbury, Pa., and
.served under General Putnam in the Revolu-
tionary War. He was a private and after-
ward successively Ensign, Lieutenant, and
Captain of Pennsylvania troops.

As a natui'al outcome of experience in other
social organizations, she became a leading
member of the Political E(iuality Club of her
home town, and had the honor to serve on the
connnittee which arranged the jirogranune
for the flrst celebration of " Foremothers' Day"
ever held in the country.

Several years ago, I)eing in ill health, her
attention was directed to osteopathy as offer-
ing some hope of restoration. The results were
so favorable that she with her husband took
up the study at the Northern Institute of Os-
teopathy, in Minneapolis, Miim., and after
finishing the course they each received the
degree of Doctor of Osteopathy. In 1897
they located themselves in Boston for the prac-
tice of their profession. Here Mrs. Achorn
is a pioneer in her work, being the first woman
to engage in the practice of osteopathy in New
England. In June, 1897, when the Boston
Institute of Osteopathy was organizerl, she
became the .secretary ami treasurer anil one
of its instructors, and she has been actively
identified with that institution to the present
time.

She is a member of the American Osteopathic
Association and of the Massachusetts Osteo-
pathic Society. She re])resented the Boston
Institute of C)ste()pathy at the sixth annual
meeting of the American Osteopathic Asso-
ciation, held in Milwaukee, Wis., August 6,
7, 8, 1902.

On account of its recent introduction the
science of osteopathy is allowed a few words of
explanation in these pages.

The following paragraphs are copied from
an address delivered by .1. Martin Littlejohn,

mate in Osteopathy, before the Royal Society

in London, and first printeil in the Journal
of the Science of Osteopathy of February, 1900 : —

" Osteopathy was first formulated by An-
drew T. Still, M.D., in 1874. He claimed that
a natural flow of blood is health; that disease
is the effect of local or general (listurl)ance
of the blootl; that to excite the nerves causes
the muscles to contract and compress the venous
fiow of blood to the heart; and that the hones
coukl be used as levers to relieve pressure on
nerves and arteries.

"The name Osteopathy was applied to the
new science on account of the fact that the
displacement of bones occupied the first place
in the category of causes or lesions producing
diseased conditions. . . . The underlying factor
is that of body order and physics tleveloped in
comiection with animal mechanics. . . .

"Osteopathy attempts to specialize the me-
chanical j3ruici])le in dealing with all kinds
of curable diseases, acute as well as chronic,
graduating pressure, tension, vibration, and
all the mechanical forms of physical stimula-
tion, in their application to muscles, bones,
blood-vessels, nerves, and organs of the body,
so as to gain therapeutic effects." It "repu-
diates drugs as foreign to the organism."



ADELAIDE FLORENCE CHASE, editor

/\ and publisher of the Club Calendar, is

/ \ a native of Fitchburg, Mass. She

comes of long lines of ancestry dating

back to the early settlement of the Bay Colony.

The daughter of Arrington and Sarah (Brown)
Gibson, .she is of the .seventh generation of the
family founded by John Gibson, to whom land
was granted in Caml)ridge (then called New-
towne), August 4, 1634. The line of descent
is: John'; John, Jr. ,M5orn about 1641; Timothy,'
born about 1679; Reuben,* born in Sudtniry,
1725; Israel,'' born in Fitchburg, 1765; Arring-
ton," born in Ashby in 1813; Adelaide Florence,
born May 5, 1862.

John GiKson, Jr.,^ fourth child of John' and
his wife Rebecca, .served in King Philip's War.
He married in 16(&gt;S Rebecca Errington, daugh-
ter of .\braham' and Rebecca (Cutler) Erring-
ton, of Cambridge, and grand-daughter of
Deacon Robert' Cutler, of Charlestown.



Deacon Timothy^ Gibson died in Stow,
Mass., in 1757. His first wife, Rebecca, the
mother of his twelve children, died in 1754.
She was a daughter of Stephen^ and Sarah
(Wootlward) Gates. Stephen' Gates, her grantl-
fathcr, came over in the "Diligent" in 1638.

Reuben* Gibson was one of the four Gibson
brothers who settled in that part of the old
town of Lunenburg which in 1764 became
Fitchburg. Reuben's farm of one hundretl
acres, on Pearl Hill, was ileeded to him by his
father in 1744. He was Sergeant in ('aptain
Ebenezer Wood's company, which marched
from Fitchburg on the Lexington alarm of
April 19, 1775. In 1776 lie was chairman of
the Committee on Safety and Correspomlence.
From the records he appears to have been a
Captain of militia. He and his brothers, it is
said, wen; "all good fighting men, famous for
great strength and courage." The house of
his brother Isaac was a garrison house, the
"Fort Gibson" of 1748, the time of the Indian
raid on the town. Captain Reuben Gibson
married at Sudbury in 1746 Lois Smitli, daugh-
ter of Thomas and Elizabeth Smith and grand-
daughter of John and Sarah (Hunt) Smith, of
Sudbury.

Israel^ Gibson was the seventh of a family
of eight children. He died in Fitchburg in
1818. His wife, Lucinda Whiting, a native of
Hanover, Mass., died July 15, 1870, in the
ninety-fourth year of her age. They hail nine
children.

Arrington" Gibson, the "Arrington Gibson,
3d," of the Fitchburg records, married April
14, 1834, Sarah Brown. She was born in Fitch-
burg, February 16, 1815, daughter of Amos antl
Sally (Mclntire) Brown.

Amos Brown, Mrs. Chase's maternal grantl-
father, was a son of Zachariah Brown, of Con-
cord, Mass., who marrieil November 27, 1766,
Martha Brown, of Watertown (or Waltham),
daughter of Daniel Brown.

Mr. and Mrs. Arrington" Gibson reared eleven
children, three .sons and eight daughters, Ade-
laide Florence being the youngest-born. She
was graduated from tlie Fitchburg High School
in 1880. After teaching school in that city
for a few months she entered the office of the
Fitchhunj Daily Sentinel, and improved her op-

portuiiity to leani the iicwspiiper business from
its beginning through all its branches.

On December 8, 1883, she was married to
Herbert Leon Chase, a native of New Hamp-
ton, N.H. For some years, or until May 1,
1898, Mr. and Mrs. Chase resided in Fitchburg.
Their home is now in \\'altham, Mass. Mr.
Chase is an o|)ti('ian, liis place of business
l)eing in Boston. Some of his ancestors served
in the Revolution. Mrs. Chase was one of the
charter members of th(&gt; Fitchlnu'g Woman's
Club, organized in 18(K). Realizing that a
periodical devoted exclusively to the interests

SIBYLLA ADELAIDE BAH.EY CRANE
was born in East Boston, Ma.ss., July
30, 1851, daughter of Henry Bailey
and his wife, Elizabeth Bellamy. Her
father was a contractor and Inhlder. His
ancestors were residents of Scituate, Ma,ss.
Her mother, a native of Kittery, Me., was the
daughter of John H. and Fanny (Keen) Bel-
lamy and grand-daughter of John Bellamy,
Jr., of Kittery, who married November 21,
1791, Tam.sen, daughter of Samuel King and
Mary (Orne) Haley.

Sibylla A. Bailey was educated in the public
schools of Boston, and for a number of years
she followed the profession of teacher in that
city. She was a lover of music and the fine



arts, and became an accomplished performer
on the piano and a pleasing vocalist.

On September 1, 1891, she was married in
Boston to the Rev. Dr. Oliver Crane, a native
of Montclair, N.J., and a graduate of Yale
College, cla,ss of 1845. Dr. Crane had been
a missionary in Turki'y for some years in his
early manhood, and later pastor of a Presby-
terian church in Carbonilale, Pa. liefore mar-
riage Mrs. Crane had made a brief trip to
Euro])e. After that event she accompanied
her hu.sl)an(l in an extended foreign tour,
travelling in the British Isles, on the Continent,
and in tlie I'^ast, spending a winter in Cairo
and visiting Syria, the scene of Dr. Crane's
missionary labors many years before. A large
number of i)hotographs and other souvenirs
attested the assiduity with which their labors
as collectors were i)ursued, from the Pyramids
of Egypt to the Alhaiubra. On their return
from abroad they took up their residence in
Boston. Here Dr. Crane died on November
29, ]89(i.

Mrs. Crane was loved l)y a large circle of
friends, not only for her talents and social
qualities, but also for her amiable disposition,
which was a marked trait in her character
from childhood. She inherited an admirable
physique, and had superior executive ability,
which made her a good' presiding officer. She
was prominent in musical and social circles
and in various patriotic and other organiza-
tions, and contributed liberally for the ad-
vancement of many worthy objects.

At the time of her death, which occurred
in Feljruary, 1902, she was president of the
Daughters of Mas.sachusetts, vice-president of
the Wednesday Morning Club, vice-i)resident
of the Castilian Club, and vice-regent of the
Boston Tea Party Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution. She was for several
years treasurer of the New England Woman's
Club and a member of the Executive Council
of the Boston Woman's Business League, alsjo
a director in the Woman's Club House Cor-
poration, a member of the Woman's Charity
Club, of the New England Woman's Press
A.ssociation, of the Moral Education Associa-
tion, of the Women's Educational and Indus-
trial Union, of the beneficent society connected

with the New England Conservatory of the
Cercle P'rancais de I'Alliance, and of the Society
for the University Education of Women.

General Henry B. Carrington, of Hyde Park,
Mass., who was intimately acquainted witli
Mrs. Sibylla Crane as the wife and afterward
the widow of his beloveil classmate, the Rev.
Oliver Crane, D.D., pays the following tribute
to her memory: —

"I did not know her personally until shortly
before their marriage, in the consvunmation
of whicli my wife and myself greatly rejoiceil.
His literary and poetical tastes found in her
congenial attributes the complement to his
most ardent wi.shes. Living so near my home,
they were like brother and sister to me. In
his last illness the intimacy became more con-
stant, until, as his last request, I })romi.scd
to give to her the affection and care of a ti'ue
brother as long as she should survive his de-
parture. And then, in the examination of
the literary and cla.ss material left by him,
I shared with her the care and disposition of
the same. . . . Tho.se years of intimate acquaint-
ance, thus ripened into years of a practical
brotherhootl, were gilded with ever-growing
appreciation of her noble qualities as wife,
daughter, and friend. Her dignity antl grace
as a woman and her refinement in tastes were
marked characteristics that any stranger would
honor. Her tender sympathies and liberal
charities abounded wlierever invoked by the
sick or the needy, and the serenity and poLse
of her character harmonized with attributes
which distinguished her from almost any other
of her sex."



ELIZABETH WILLIAMS MITCHELL,
of Boston, Mass., real estate agent,
is a native of Newport, Monmouth-
shire, England. Born February 7,
1874, daughter of William and Susan (Allen)
Williams, she came to this country in 1885,
her parents, with five boys and two girls,
leaving Liverpool on April 22 by the " Grand
Republic" of the White Star Line and arriving
in New York, May 5. The family went to
Salem, N.H., where the children's grand-
father, Henry Buck, who had inunigrated



some years previously, received them. Their
mother was born in England, December 10,
1848, and their father, July 8, 1847. They
were married September 21, 1869. The
father was a farmer, and still follows that
calling in Salem, N.H. In religion both
parents are Methodists. One boy and two
girls were born to them in Salem, N.H., making
ten children hi all — namely, Thomas, Alfred,
Elizabeth (the subject of this sketch), John,
Sarah Jane, William Henry, George, Susan,
Hikla May, and Harold Allen.

Mrs. Mitchell began to attend the common
schools in Newjjort, England, when she was
about five years oKl, and continued her studies
in the Salem schools until she was fourteen.
At the age of twenty she came to Boston,
and took the full covu'se at Comer's Business
College, where she was graduated November
30, 1897. On December 2 she ailvertised
in the Boston Herald for a position, and thereby
obtained employment the next day with the
E. J. Hammond Lumber Company in the
Exchange Building. She left that place after
three months to take a position with L. P.
Hollander &amp; Co., dry goods merchants of
Boston, but gave this up shortly to become
private .secretary of Miss E. P. Sohier, the
secretary of the Free Public Library Com-
mission. Retaining this position, at the same
time she accepted the office of agent for the
Massachu.setts Volunteer Aid Association, in
which Mi.ss Sohier was an active worker.
As agent, besides attending to an unusually
large correspondence, she had to investigate
every case for relief called to the attention
of the Association, visiting the dwellings of
the objects of the relief, ascertaining what
was needed, and, when the case was a worthy
one, supplying the same, such as fuel, clothing,
food, and lodging. In the performance of
her duties she was frecjuently obliged to travel
both in and out of the State. Yet, busy as
her secretaryship and agency made her, she
was able to add to her occupations that of
collector for the Associated Charities in their
admirable work of promoting, by their home
savings effort, the habit of saving among the
poor. This she did evenings, and the work
took her into the poorer families of the sundry

nationalities comprising the city's immigrant
population at both the North and South
Ends, enabling her to acquire valuable ex-
perience. The sums so collected by her at
each visit varietl from five to twenty-five
cents, the Associated Charities becoming
trustees therefor until the amount became
large enough to bank, when the owner was
duly notihed and atlvised what bank to place
it in. In this period she also performed the
arduous duty of visitor for tlie AsvSociated
Charities, investigating ami reporting cases
of extreme poverty coming umler her notice.
Nor was this all: at one time she simultaneously
served in no less than eight different cajjacities
of importance.

Her hrst experience in the real estate busi-
ness was in assisting the agent of the tenement
house ])ro])erty of the Boston Co-operative
Building Company, located in different parts
of the city. To this she devoted every iSatur-
day, visiting every tenement, and seeing that
a code of rules made by the proprietors was
observed.

In 1899 she gave up her engagement with
the As.sociated Charities to take charge of a
number of tenement houses on Lan.sdowne
Street for J. F. F. Brewster, a Boston real
estate dealer. A year later she had charge
of a number of apartment hou.ses in the Mount
Bowdoin district in Dorchester, rented by
the month. Later she obtained charge of
the Ellis Memorial Building in South Boston,
owned by the Improved Dwelling Association,
containing fifty-six tenements. She resigned
her agency for the Massachusetts Volunteer
Aid As.sociation in May, 190L

Besides the estates already named, she
now has charge of property on Rochester
and Eustis Streets, Edgerly Place, and other
localities. She has been remarkably success-
ful in handling the properties entrusted to
her. She gives them her pensonal super-
vision, and orders all repairs when necessary,
never taking a conmiission for such services
except from the proprietors. Of her own
volition she follows the example of the Bos-'
ton Co-operative Building Company, obliging
all tenants to observe a number of printed
rules displayed on sundry parts of the estates



subject to them (this in relation to tenement
or apartment property). Her tactful enforce-
ment of the rules has made a profitable in-
vestment of all the tenement property in her
hands, while at the same time the mutual
regard for each other's rights required of the
tenants by Ww. rules has made healthier and
hapi)ier homes for all. She collects rents
from about five hundred families, and, although
her rules are strict, they are obeyed. One
of her tenants says: —

"Mrs. Mitchell lias pretty strict rules, but
she is kind and helpful to us in many ways.
She means what she says. It is one of her
rules that all tenants must. pay in advance, but
if we have been sick, and are out of money, she
lets our rent run until we are able to pay it."

Another says: " Mrs. Mitchell has done a won-
derful lot of good arovmd here. She is always
bright and cheerful when she comes to see
us. She always says something encouraging."

About four years ago three blocks of tene-
ments on Lansdowne Street, Roxbury, were '
placed under her management. She saw there
was urgent neetl of a kindergarten in the
vicinity. Her appeal to the city having
been refused, she succeeded in getting the
Kindergarten Training School to furnish
teachers. She then had her office arranged
for a school-room, reserving only one corner
for her desk, where she attends to business
thrice a week. Every day, from nine o'clock
till one, twenty small children attend this
school, with two training-school girls for
teachers. In the same school there are weekly
classes for girls in reading and sewing and a
gymnasium for boys. • By special effort a
branch of the Public Lilirary was established
in the school-room, so that the whole neighbor-
hood has free access to good reading.

In regard to the statement that many of
the ])oor do not appreciate a bath-tub, but
use it as a receptacle for various articles, she
says: "None of my tenants neglect their
bath-tubs. In the first place, I would not
allow it; and, in the second, the tenants show
a desire for cleanliness when encouraged in it."

The sanitary condition of her houses is
unusually good, as she makes every effort
to promote the cleanliness and good health

of the tenants, ami allows none who are in-
toxicated to remain.

By making the comfort of her tenants her
chief object Mrs. Mitchell believes that every
other purpose of her business is best served.
Then she feels a conscientious obligation to
tlo good whenever the occasion offers in the
course of her business relations with her tenants.
Among the laboring people she has frequent
occasion to give a word of advice in season.
Gaudy furniture bought on the instalment
plan in the home of a poor family (juickly
arouses her indignation. She discourages
such purchases when she can do so without
giving offence. Siie is also opi)osed t(j the
practice among many poor families of in-
suring its members, as constituting a deplorable
leak of their slender rescnu'ces.

Besides caring for dwellings as described,
she buys, .sells, and lea.ses estates, and trans-
acts insurance business. In former years her
business was carried on under the name of
E. A. Williams: it is now conducted under
that of E. W. Mitchell. -She was married
to William Frederick Mitchell, October 15,
1902, in Boston, by the Rev. Henry Martin
Saville, of St. Mark's Church, Dorchester.

Mr. Mitchell was born in Auburn, Me.,
September 2, 1876, son of Almon and Clara
(Henderson) Mitchell. His mother was Eng-
lish - born. His father, born in AVebster,
Me., was son of Hiram Mitchell, who was a
land-owner and a man of importance in the
district. At the Mitchell homestead were
preserved sundry ancestral relics, including
a bayonet that saw service in the Revolution.
Mr. Mitchell was brought up in Sabattus,
Me., receiving his early education in the schools,
grammar and high, of the district. In April,
1S90, he obtained employment in the print-
ing department of the Hollingsworth &amp; Whitney
Company, paper manufacturers. Sub.se(juently
he had charge of their stereotyping depart-
ment for four years. In the fall and winter
seasons of this period he attended evening
school. When the late war with Spain began,
he enlisted in Jmie, 1898, in the Ignited States
Hospital Corps, and went to Fort Myer,
Va., arriving there July 5, 1898, and serving
in the general hospital for about six months.



Then he accompanied the corps upon the
United States transport "Sheridan," by way
of the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal,
to Manila, in (he Philippines, where he arrived
April 7, 1899, soon after the breaking out
of the insin-rection of the natives against
American control. While there he saw the
bombardment of ParaiuKjue and the skirmish
known as the battle of Quinguia. He aided
in removing the wounded from the field to
the "Sheridan" after the last-named action,
and subse(iuently shared in attending to
their needs; and he went back to Manila
with the body of Colonel Stoutenburg, of a
Nebraska regiment.

From what he saw of the natives Mr. Mitchell
acquired a high opinion of their intelligence
and of their fitness for self-government. He
saw none of the cruelties allegetl to have been
inflicted on them by our soldiers, whereas
he was a witness to the general gootl treat-
ment of Filij)ino prisoners, especially of the
wounded at our soldiers' hands. Returning
to Boston in the fall of 1901, he spent the
ensuing year in the capacity of nurse at the
City Hospital. He also became a law student
of the Boston University Class of 1903.

He is a member of the following University
organizations: the Class Senate, the Quiz
Club, the Bigelow Club, and the William E.
Russell Club. Since his marriage he has
been engaged in the real estate business, it
having no connection with that of Mrs. Mitchell.
He makes a specialty of looking up titles
to real estate. He is a member of the Y. M.
C. A. and of the Harvard Improvement Asso-
ciation of Dorchester; and he is Prelate in the
Cross and Crown Commandery of the Knights
of Malta.

In religion Mrs. Mitchell is an Episcopalian.
She was a member of the Girls' Friendly
Society of Boston and of the Athene Club
of Dorchester.

ters of the American Revolution, was

son (Jones) Worth, of Charlestown, and on
the paternal side comes from Vermont and
Nantucket Quaker stock. Her father is a
lineal descendant in the seventh generation
of William Worth, of Nantucket (son of John
Worth, of Devonshire, England), the Hne being
William'; John,' born in 1666; Richard,' 1692;
Lionel," 1737; William,^ 1762; Samuel," 1795;
Ira Allen,' born October 23, 1828, during the
temporary stay of his parents at Farnham,
Canada. Lionel' Worth, brother of William,'
settled at Salisbury, Mass.; and Richartl'
Worth, another brother, settletl at Newbury
and later removed to New Jensey.

William' Worth married in Nantucket in
1665 Sarah Macy, daughter of Thomas' Macy.
John," their only son, married Miriam Gardner,
daughter of Richard Gardner, Sr. RichanP
Worth married in 1729, fifth month, twentieth
day, Sarah Hoeg. Lionel' married in 1761
Martha Mitchell, a native of Cuba, but then
a resident of Kittery, Me. This marriage, it
is said, brought Spanish blood into the
family.

W^illiam,'* eldest child of Lionel" and Martha,
was born in Loudon, N.H. He died at Starks-
boro, Vt., in 1849, twelfth month, twenty-
third day. His wife was Bet.sy Tibbetts.
Samuel," their eighth child, born in Loudon,
removed with his father to Starksboro, Vt.
He died at Farnham, Canada, not long after
the birth of his son Ira. Samuel" Worth mar-
ried in February, 1822, Mrs. Phebe Husted
Carpenter, a widow, daughter of Ezekiel Husted
and granfl-daughter of Jethro and Rachel
(Brewer) Husted. Her Husted ancestors were
among the early Dutch settlers of Schenec-
tady, N.Y.

Mrs. Pendergast's mother, a native of Charles-
town, Mass., was born July 14, 1832, the daugh-
ter of Joshua and Abigail (Thompson) Jones.
Her father, Joshua Jones, was born in 1799
in Burlington, being a son of Aaron and Re-
becca (Beard) Jones and grandson of Joshua
Jones, who was of Woburn in Revolutionary
times. Rebecca Beard, wife of Aaron Jones,
is said to have been of Scotch descent.

Abigail, wife of Joshua Jones of Charles-
town and grandmother of Mrs. Pendergast,
was a daughter of Captain Jonathan" Thomp-



son, who was born in Woburn, April 26, 1760,
son of SamueP and Abigail (Tidd) Thompson.
Samuel,^ born in Woburn, October 30, 1731,
was of the fifth generation in descent from
James Thompson, of Woburn, who became
a member of the church in Charlestown in
August, 1633, and in 1640 was one of the thirty-
two men who subscribed to the town orders
of Woburn, where he settletl. The Thomp-
son line of ancestry is: James,' Jonathan,' '
Samuel,"'' Jonathan," .•\l)igail,' Mrs. Pender-
gast's maternal grandmotlier, who was born
August 23, 1800, and died December 28, 1876.
(See "Memorial of James Thompson and his
Descendants," by the Rev. Leander Thomp-
son, that book being also the authority for the
civil and military records of Thompson ances-
tors following.)

Samuel Thoiniison, great-great-grandfather
of Mrs. Pendergast, was fitted for college be-
fore he was seventeen, but on account of his
father's sudden death chang'd his plans and
retnained at home, the family needing his help.
The house on Elm Street, North Woburn, in
which he lived, and where he died August 17,
1820, was built by his father about 1-730, and
partly rebuilt by himself in 1764. He became
a surveyor, and engaged in important surveys
in Woburn and in other towns, some of his
work being on the Middlesex Canal.

While on the latter survey, he discovered in
Wilmington a wild apj)le-trce who.se fruit he
named the "Pecker," as the tree showed that
woodpeckers abounded in that region. He
sub.sequently named this variety of apples
"the Thomp.son." Many trees were grafted
by Samuel Thompson and his brother Abijah.
They gave grafts of the trees to a friend and
neighbor. Colonel Loanmii Baldwin, who cul-
tivated them with great .success and distributed
the fruit far and wide. This, we are told, is
the true story of the "Baldwin" ap{)le, formerly
the "Thompson," as certified by the monu-
ment at Wilmington.

In 1758, during the French and Indian War,
Samuel Thomjison held a commission as Lieu-
tenant of provincials, and was stationed for
a time near Lake George. "On the morning
of the 19th of April, 1775, when the alarm was
given that the British troops were marching

towaixl Concortl, he iiml his two brothers were
among the first to comprehend the grave im-
portance of the occasion. Innnediately seiz-
ing his musket, he hurried to the scene of ac-
tion, where he performed heroic service. He
brought home a musket taken by his own
hands from a British sohUer whom he had
wounded in the conflict."

Sanuiel Thopipson was a Deacon of the Con-
gregational church of Woburn nearly thirty-
six years. Among other offices which he held
was that of parish clerk. Selectman, Represent-
ative to the General Court for eight years,
and Justice of the Peace more than thirty
years. " His character for the strictest in-
tegrity was known and appreciated through-
out his own and neighboring counties; and,
although he was a constant witness of liti-
gation, he was universally and em])hati-
cally called, by those who knew him, a peace-
maker."

His death occurred August 17, 1820. His
first wife was Abigail Titld, of Woburn, who
died in 176S; his second, Lydia Jones, of Con-
cord, who died in 1788; and his third, Esther,
widow of Jesse Wyman and daughter of the
Rev. Joseph Burbeen, of Wobvu'n.

Jonathan Thompson, although not cjuite
fifteen years of age when the alarm of war
was sounded April 19, 1775, borrowed a musket,
and followed his father and uncle to Concord,
taking with him the leaden weights of the
scales, which he had moulded into bullets at
the shop of a neighbor.

" ( )n his arrival at Concord the more direct
fighting was past, and the enemy were just
starting on their retreat toward Boston. Notic-
ing that the method of annoyance employed
by his countrymen was that of gaining the
head of the retreating columns by a circuitous
route, and then from a favorable position,
previously chosen, pouring their shot among
the ranks till all had passeil, he did the same.
In one of these circuits, to their nmtual sur-
prise, he met his father, who at once exclaimed:
'Why, Jonathan, are you here? Well, take
care of yourself. Your uncle Dani d has been
killed. Be prudent, my son, and take care
of yourself.' Father and son then each pur-
sued his way. Jonathan foUowetl the retreat-



ing army to Lexington and then to West Cam-
bridge, now Arlington, from which place he
crossed over to Medford, where, with others,
he sought refuge in a barn, reaching home
safely early the following morning.

" He subsequently served a campaign as
fifer and several more as a private. He was
at Ticonderoga and in Arnold's flotilla on Lake
Champlain, the vessel during the action there
being run ashore to avoid a surrender, and
the crew escaping into the neighboring forest,
where for three days they dodgeil the Indians
and were without food. They at last escaped
the pursuit by swimming a river, across which,
the day being cold and the Indians having no
canoe, their savage pursuers declined to follow
them. Jonathan Thompson was subsequently
at Stillwater, at Saratoga, at the surrender of
Burgoyne, White Plains, etc., serving in the
army about three years." During a part of
the time he served as drummer. After the
Revolution he became Captain of militia, and
until his death, November 20, 1836, was famil-
iarly called Captain John.

Jonathan" Thompson, Mrs. Pendergast's
great-grandfather, married August 9, 1781,
Mary, daughter of Deacon Jeduthan'^ Rich-
ardson (Thomas,* SamueP^'), of that part of
Woburn that is now Winchester.

Deacon Jeduthan^ Richardson, great-great-
grantlfather of Mrs. Pendergast, was a Lieu-
tenant in the Third Company, Second Middle-
sex County Regiment, in the Revolutionary
War.

Another of her great-great-grandfathers,
Joshua Jones, of Woburn, was a soldier in Cap-
tain Walker's company. Colonel David Greene's
regiment, and was in service at the time of the
Lexington alarm, April 19, 1775; and in the
same company was a fourth great-great-grand-
father, Samuel Beard, of Wilmington.

Ira Allen and Emily Thompson (Jones)
Worth hatl one son, Charles Frederick, who
died in infancy. They removed to Charlestown
when their daughter Ella was a year old; and
she received her education in its public schools,
being graduated .with honors from the high
school, July 24, 1868, the day before her seven-
teenth birthday. She entereil upon the active
duties of life by accepting an appointment



354



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



as teacher of the Bunker Hill Primary School
(No. 6). While holding the position, her
success as a teacher being established, she
received a flattering call to teach in Toledo,
Ohio; and her declination was received with
regret by the superintendent of schools of
that city.

In 1873 she resigned her position, and became
the wife of George Henry Pendergast, a well-
known and highly respected citizen of Charles-
town. They now live in Somerville, having
recently removed to their new home, at the
corner of Broadway and Sycamore Street.
They have two children: Florence Worth, born
April 17, 1886; and Harold Worth, born Feb-
ruary 14, 1892. These children were the
nucleus of the Jonathan Thompson Society
of the C. A. R.

Mrs. Pendergast was actively identified with
the First Universalist Church of Charlestown for
many years, and was before her marriage one
of a party of young amateurs who aided the
church treasury by giving theatrical enter-
tainments, in which she filled the role of lead-
ing lady with considerable merit. The Norum-
bega Woman's Club, of Charlestown, welcomed
her as a member soon after its organization.
She accepted an election as its vice-president,
but has declined the honor of becoming presi-
dent, which has twice been tendered. Although
continuing her interest and membership in
the club, other duties prevented her from
accepting its leadership. Mrs. Pendergast
is a life member of the Hunt Asylum for
Destitute Children, is interested in the Win-
chester Home for Aged Women, and has been
an early and continuous friend of the Boston
Floating Hospital, a charity very near her
heart.

In February, 1898, Mrs. Pendergast with
others organized the Jonathan Thompson So-
ciety of the Children of the American Revo-
lution, and she conducted it successfully for
over two years, holding most of the meetings
in her own home. In April, 1900, she gave
up its presidency (but continues as a contribut-
ing member), and assumed the duties of Regent
of Bunker Hill Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution. She is a charter mem-
ber of this chapter, and served three years as



Vice-Regent before accepting the ofhce of
Regent. The chapter prospered under her
guidance. Her progressive ideas, executive
ability, and efficient management met the ap-
proval of the members. The term of office
as Regent expired in April, 1902.

Recently requested to become the State
Regent of the Massachusetts D. A. R., Mrs.
Pendergast on account of home cares felt obliged
to decline the honor, as she did two years ago,
when urged to take the position of State Di-
rector for Massachusetts Children of the Ameri-
can Revolution.

Mrs. Pendergast is a woman of literary talent
and the author of several poems. The ode sung
at the reunion of the Charlestown High School
Alunmi Association in 1S84 was written by her
for that occasion.

Her spacious home contains many relics,
books, and souvenirs of value, among them
being the sword l)rought home by Samuel
Thompson from the French and Indian wars
and the drumsticks used l)y Jonathan Thomp-
.son in the Revolution. Upon the wall hang
the Pendergast coat of aims and the Worth
coat of arms, both framed and artistically ex-
ecuted.

An aunt. Miss Nancy Pendergast, who is a
member of her family, was an army nurse dur-
ing the Civil War, and served in the hospitals at
Point Lookout and Anna])olis.



BARBARA GALPIN.— For twenty-five
years Mrs. Galpin has been identified
with the SomerriUe Journal, which
is said to be one of the best and most
widely known weekly local papers in the United
States, l)eing in a class by itself in tlie matter
of literary excellence, home attractions, and
editorial enterprise.

Mrs. Galpin was born in Weathersfield, Vt.,
daughter of Henry Clay Johnson. Her moth-
er's maiden name was Helen Frances Jones.
From four years of age she lived in Claremont,
N.H., where she attended the Stevens High
School. At sixteen she married Henry Wallace
Galpin, a well-to-do citizen, many years her
senior. One son, George, was born to them.
While she was still in her teens, her husband

(Wed, and complications in business matters
wrecked the estate, and left her dependent
upon her own energies.

Coming to Somerville a quarter of a century
ago, this woman, now honored in social, fra-
ternal, and professional life, took her place at
the compositor's case, where she soon became
an expert. Incidentally she held copy, and
at her own motion l)egan to edit manuscript,
through which cchting she first attracted
attention. She soon became a proof-reader,
and gave the paper its distinction for ty-
pographical as well as literary excellence.
From this it was a short cut to editorial
management, which she combined with pro-
motion of circulation, where her business
ability first showed itself. When, sixteen years
ago, the proprietor became the treasurer of
Middlesex County, Mrs. Galpin assumed the
management of the business details, while re-
taining oversight of the circulation schemes
and all literary and special features of the
pa])er.

The Woman's Page, which she conducts,
and which has been one of the leaiiing feat-
ures of the paper, has been on as high a level
as the work in any of the popular literary
weeklies, and would of itself give her tlistinc-
tion in journalism. Her many series of
articles on travel, both in America and in Eu-
rope, are among the most readable and in-
structive of their kind in magazine literature.
One of the most complete of her series has
been issued in book form, under the caption
"In Foreign Lantls." Her historical articles
have attracted even more attention, and one
of these has been published by the Somer-
ville Historical Society as its first official issue.
As a writer of verse and songs, Mrs. Galpin
has won high praise. She has been ecjually
fortunate in public speaking. Her promi-
nence in various lines of activity leil to invi-
tations to make addresses before women's
clubs, historical .societies, and various other
associations. Her platform work is as care-
fully prepared as is the work from her ]:)en,and
her reputation as a speaker is well-nigh equal
to that in literary effort. Her most important
addresses in point of honor were before the
Suburban Press Association of New England



and the Woman's Congress at the Workl's
Fair in 1893.

Mrs. Galpin has given her son a liberal
and professional education. She has a beauti-
ful home on Spring Hill, with a valuable li-
brary, and has won a place in the esteem and
respect of the citizens rarely won by man or
woman in any community. It was an article
from her pen that led to the first meeting of
the Heptorean Club of Somerville, of which
she was one of the organizers. She became a
charter member, has been treasurer since the
foundation of the club, has been on the Board
of Directors from the first, and has hatl much
influence in making this one of the leading
women's clubs of the country. Mrs. Galpin
was also a charter member of the New Eng-
lanil Woman's Press Club, of which she was
treasurer for several years.

At the completion of twenty-five years in
journalism in one office and under one manage-
ment, in the fall of 1903, the citizens of Somer-
ville gave Mrs. Galpin a reception and dinner
at the Vendome in Boston, as a testimonial
of their appreciation of her efforts in all lines
of work in the city.

The Mayor, Iildward Glines, presented the
greetings of the city, anil other city officials,
noted educators, and celebrated women of the
State paid tribute to Mrs. Galpin's work and
character.

Notwithstanding her busy life, she has been
a leailer in many philantliropic and progres-
sive civic movements. Few women have
impressed themselves upon the community
so effectively in so many ways as has she, and
in everything she has undertaken she has been
eminently successful. While still in the prime
of life, she is winning ilistinction as a writer
and as a speaker, in society and in philan-
thropy, though her energies are largely devoted
to the literary and office direction of a pros-
perous weekly journal.



SARAH ELIZABETH FULLER, a Past
National President of the Woman's Re-
lief Corps, was the first President of the
Department of Ma.ssachusetts — the pio-
neer State organization — and has a record of

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



forty years' faithful service for the soldiers of
the Union, she having enrolled herself as a
worker in the Christian Commission during the
early days of the Civil War.

She was born August 1, 1S38, in Portland,
Me. She is descended on the paternal side
from a titled English family, whose ancestry
she is able to trace back for over three hun-
dred years, and on the maternal side is of
Scottish extraction. Her father, Samuel Mills,
was born July 23, 1S04, and dieil January 31,
1888. He married Betsey Haines, who was born
June 17, 1811, died February 21, 1886. Sanuiel
Mills was son of Jacob Mills, Jr., born in 1763,
and his wife, Sarah Taylor, born in 1765;
grandson of Jacob Mills, born in 1720, and
his wife, Elizabeth Cutts, born in 1729; and
great-grand.son of John Mills, who died in 17S().

Many of her ancestors were distinguislicHl
for piety and scholarship, some being noted
lawyers and two great-uncles filling the ofhce
of Secretary of State in Maine. Her grandsires
on both sides fought in the Revolutionary
War, also in the War of 1812.

Her father, Samuel Mills, who was an intense
abolitionist and a public-spiriteil citizen, taught
his daughter to take an interest in the leading
topics of the day. When only a school-girl,
she attended with him meetings which were
addressed by Daniel Webster, Rufus Choate,
Charles Sunmer, Wendell Phillips, and other
great orators of that j^eriod. These early les-
sons had a marked effect upon her character.
Her education was begun in the public schools
of Portland, but, her parents removing to East
Boston in 1849, her school studies were com-
pleted in that city.

In 185.5 Sarah E. Mills married George W.
Fuller,, of Canton, Me. In 1861 the call for
seventy-five thousand men aroused a spirit of
patriotism that left its shadow on her threshold.
Mr. P\iller respondinl to the call for volunteers,
but was rejected as physically unable to bear
the hardships of war. In 1862 he volunteered
in the naval service, on the gunboat " Roanoke,"
but his frail constitution was d(H'med a barrier.
He did not, however, abandon the hope of serv-
ing his country. On February 12, 1864, he
enrolled his name for the third time, and was
mustered into the .service six days later as a



member of Company C, Fourth Massachusetts
Cavalry. The regiment remained in camp at
Readville until April 24, when it sailed from
Boston for Newport News, Va., on the steamer
" \\'estern Metropolis." At Petersbiu'g in the
following June Mr. Fuller was stricken with
malarial tyi)hoid fever, and was removed to
the hospital at Portsmouth, Va. He died July
2, 1864, and is buried in the National Cemetery
at Hampton, \'a.

As stated aliove, from the early days of the
Civil War Mrs. Fuller assisted in preparing hos-
pital stores and other comforts for the soldiers.
She also participated in many patriotic con-
certs given in Maine and M;issachusetts for the
hosjMtal fund. The ilay after the news of the
battle of Antietam was received at the North,
she arranged with the help of a few others a
concert fnjm which four hmidred dollars were
realized. This money was converted into ar-
ticles which were forwarded to the front in
less than two days after the concert was given.
For seventeen years Mrs. l^'uller was a faithful
member of the Handel and Haydn Society of
lioston.

Remembering with gratitude that one of the
noble band of army nurses ministered to her
husband in the hospital, she has consecrated
her life to the soldiers' cause. She represented
Ward One of Boston on the Executive Com-
mittee of the Christian Conunission. \Mien
the Grand Army of the Rei)ublic was formed,
its objects enlisted her sympathies. In 1871
she assisted in forming a Ladies' Aid Society,
auxiliary to Joseph Hooker Post, No. 23, of
East I^oston. She served as secretary, vice-
president, and president, also as a delegate to
the State convention of Ladies' Auxiliary So-
cieties, held at Fitchburg, February 12, 1879.
At this convention the Woman's State Relief
Corps of Massachu.setts was formed. Mrs.
Fuller was cho.sen president, and was the first
signer to its constitution. She was re-elected
to this office in 1880 and in 1881. That she
won the suj^port of many who were at first
sce|)tical in regard to tli(&gt; success of the move-
ment is now a matter of record. There were
not a few discouragements, but voice and pen
united to surmount them; for, eloquent in
speech and convincing in argument, Mrs.

Fuller wisely directed both for the best inter-
ests of the cause.

The platform of the new order, welcoming
to membership all loyal women who were will-
ing to work for the veterans, was a broad one.
The impressive ritualistic service and thorough
methods of organizing indicated that the order
had been formed upon u permanent basis. To
win the approval of the Grand Army was the
next step taken in the line of progress, for local
corps could only be instituted by request of
posts. General Horace Binney Sargent, De-
partment Commander when the Woman's Re-
lief Corps was formed, his successor, Captain
John G. B. Adams, and Captain James F.
Meech, Assistant Adjutant-general, gave hearty
support to Mrs. Fuller and her a.ssociates. The
use of Grand Army heatkiuarters in Boston was
tendered them for weekly meetings. Here they
consulted with i)ost ccjuimanders, ex])lained the
objects of Relief Corps work to numerous in-
quirers, and outlined plans that i)roved of great
value.

In 18SI acommittee was chosen by the women
of the Relief (!orps to co-operate with the
trustees of the. Soldiers' Home in their plans
for the bazaar. Mrs. Fuller was chairman, and
by her personal appeals, official correspondence,
and public addresses created great interest in
the project, as shown by the fact that the Re-
lief Cori)s tables netted four thousand one hun-
dred and eighty-nine dollars and twenty-five
cents. Mrs. Fuller was the first woman to give
a public address in behalf of the Home, accept-
ing an invitation exteniled by General Sargent
to speak in Haverhill. When the Home was
dedicated, Mrs. Fuller in an eloquent address
presented, on behalf of friends, a Bible, burgee,
and flag, which were procured at her suggestion.
These gifts the trustees acknowledged by a vote
of thanks, beautifully engrossed, now hanging on
the walls of department headfiuarters.

Mrs. Fuller has served in official jxisitions in
the Ladies' Aid Association oi the Soldiers'
Home ever since its formation, in 1SS2. At
present she is one of the vice-presidents. A
room in the Home has been dedicated in her
honor by the Department W. R. C, and her
portrait, the gift of John A. Hawes Relief Corps,
No. 3, of East Boston, has been placed upon its



walls. This corps also presented her portrait
to Grand Army Hall. William Logan Rodman
Post, No. 1, of New Bedford, likewise has thus
honored her. Her portrait also hangs upon
the walls of department headquarters in Bos-
ton, a gift from her many friends throughout
the State.

Upon n^tiring from the presidency at the
annual convention in 1882, Mrs. Fuller was
chosen secretary of the Department of Massa-
chusetts. In her capacity as President and
secretary she travelled thousands of miles, in-
stituted nineteen corps in Ma.ssachusetts, five
in Maine, and assisted Mrs. E. Florence Barker
and Mrs. M. S. Goodale, associate officers, at
the institution of eighteen others. The De-
partment Encampment, G. A. R., of Massachu-
.setts adopted a resolution January 27, 1881,
recognizing the Woman's Relief Corps as "an
invaluable ally in its mission of charity and
loyalty" and "as a noble band of Christian
women, who, while not of the Grand Army of
the Repuf)lic, are auxiliary to it." ' The word
"State" was dro])ped, and the word "Depart-
ment" substituted, thus conforming to the
title of the Grand Army.

Mrs. Fuller conducted a large correspond-
ence, writing hundreds of letters and arousing
an interest in the order outside of Massachu-
setts. Sh(^ believed in a national organization,
and penned the first letter in its behalf. She
secured the interest of jirominent comrades in
New Hampshire, and it was announceil in
general orders of Department Connnander
George Bowers, of that State, that a conven-
tion would be held at Laconia, October 21,
1880. Mrs. Fuller and Mrs. E. Florence Barker
were invited to organize a State Department.
The success of the work having been assureil
in Massachu.setts and New Hampshire, a cor-
respondence was conducted with the G. A. R.
officials in Connecticut. As the result, in No-
vember, 1882, Mrs. Fuller, in company with
Mrs. Barker (her successor as Department
President), organized several corps in that
State. The Union Board, comprising the De-
partments of Mas.sachu,setts, New Hampshire,
and Coimecticut, was formeil with heailquar-
ters in Boston.

Mrs. Fuller, who realizetl from the first the

necessity for a national order, was one of the
three delegates chosen to represent the Depart-
ment of Massachusetts at the convention in
Denver, Col., in 1883. This convention, callcil
by Commander-in-chief Paul Van Der Voort,
resulted in the National Woman's Relief Cor]is,
the early history of which is given in the sketch
of Mrs. E. Florence Barker. Mrs. Fuller was
a prominent participant in the convention,
and was unanimously chosen National Sec-
retary. A busy year ensued. Over two
thousand communications were written and
many hundred pages of instruction prepared
by her, numerous otlier duties also receiving
attention. From September 5, 1SS3, to Feb-
ruary 23, 1884, she issued sup])lies for eiglity-
nine cor))s.

At the second National ('onvention, held at
Minneapolis, July, 1884, she was elected Senior
Vice-President. Dining that year she insti-
tuted three corps in Rhode Island and visited
Vermont on a tour of inspection, organizing a
department in that State. At the third Na-
tional Convention, held in Portland, Me., in
June, 1885, she was elected National President,
and, upon returning home tendered her resig-
nation as Dei)artment secretary of Massachu-
setts. Meanwhile she had organized Corps No.
3 in East Boston, auxiliary to John A. Hawes
Post, No. 159, and for nearly two years served
as its president. In view of her retirement
from the presidency of Corps No. 3, in order to
enter upon her duties as the official heatl of
the National Woman's Relief Corps, the post
on July 24, 1885, adopted a series of resolutions
ex])ressing their warm ajjpreciation of her
loyalty and devotion to the principles of the
order and of the valuable services she had
rendered them, and assiu'ing her that the sin-
cere and heartfelt good wishes of the post
would follow her day by day, as she continued
to labor for the good of the order in the high
position to which she had been called.

louring her year as National President, Mrs.
Fuller visited the Departments of New Hamp-
shire, New York, Penn.sylvania, Ohio, and Illi-
nois. She carried on a large correspondence
and addressed many {)ublic gatherings. She
issued a series of eight general orders, one of
which, a memorial tribute to General Grant,



was widely read, and considered a document
of historic interest.

It was dated " He;i(l&lt;(uarters Woman's Re-
lief Corps, Auxiliary to the Grand Army of the
Republic, Boston, July 23, 1885," and was in
part as follows: —

"On this bright suamier morning the bells
are tolling the reciuiem of our country's noble
dead.

" Ex-President Ulyi^ses S. Cirant has closetl
his eyes and laid him ilown to rest. The long,
weary months of pairi and suffering are over,
and our brave, lion-liearted Commander and
comrade is no more. . . .

"As an auxiliary to the Grand Army of the
Republic, who to-day mourn the loss of their
conn-ade, it is fitting Jiat we, the members of
the Woman's Relief ('orps, should unite with
them in our expre.ssio is of sorrow and mourn-
ing.

"Therefore, in recognition of the faithful ser-
vices of this patriot, sildier, and friend, and as
a tribute of our respectt and love for the 'Hero
of A]ipomattox' and (:ur grateful rememl)rance
of his licroic deeds, the charters of all corps
throughout our order will be draped in emblems
of mourning for sixty days, and at the first
regular meeting after the receipt of this order
all corjis shall set apart one hour for special
services commemorati-^e of his life and glorious
deeds as a soldier. . .

"Dei)artment and corps presidents are
charged with a jjrompt distribution of this
order.

" By command of

" Sarah E. Fuller,
" Ndlionnl President.
"Eleanor B. ^^■heeler,
"National Secretary^

At the fourth annual convention in San
Francisco in July, 188(), Mrs. Fuller was elected
a member of the National Executive Board,
and at St. Louis a year later was unanimously
cliosen a life member of the board. In LS89
she was elected secretary of the Conmiittee of
Arrangements for the Eighth National Con-
vention, to be held in Boston in 1890. As sec-
retary of the National Pension Connnittee for



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



359



Army Nurses, she was called to \Vashington in
June, 1889. She conferred with committees
and Congressmen, rendering valualjle aid in
support of favorable legislation for the pending
bill. She was prostrated by the intense heat
from which the city of Washington suffered
during that summer. A severe illness followed,
resulting in serious deafness, and she was obliged
to defer active work for two years.

She was elected Department Treasurer in
February, 1892, and has Ijeen unanimously re-
elected at every subsequent State convention.
She can rightfully claim the honor of being the
pioneer of the Woman's Relief Corps. The
organization, which now numbers one hundred
and fift}' thousand members, is largely intlebted
to her for the written work which was the foun-
dation of its ritualistic system. Of her it may
be said, as of Alexander Hamilton, that valu-
able facts are stored away in the deep recesses
of her mind, to rest untlisturbed until needed
for reference. She is recognized authority on
historical matters. She has delivered Memo-
rial Day addresses in Maine, New Hampshire,
and Massachusetts, and has addressed hun-
dreds of camp-fires and other patriotic gather-
ings. She has friends in every State in the
Union.

She is a member of the Executive Committee
of Arrangements for the National Convention
in Boston (August, 1904), chairman of the En-
tertainment Conmiittee, and a worker on sev-
eral sub-committees.

As National Counselor she has performed
active duties during the, past year, and will
have a prominent part in all the receptions and
other gatherings connected with the Order
during encampment week.

Her activities have not been confined to one
branch of work. She is broad-mintled, and
her executive ability is quickly recognized in
any organization in which she becomes inter-
ested. In the Sunday-school coimected with
the Meridian Street Methodist Episcopal Church,
of East Boston, of which she is a member, she
was for many years the teacher of a large class
of young ladies. In temperance work she has
always been active, filling prominent offices in
the Independent Order of Good Templars, and
is a Past Grand Conunaniler of the United



Order of the Golden Cross. Three years she
has served as chaplain of the Sarah Bradlee
Fulton Chapter, Daughters of the American
Revolution, of Medford. She is also an earnest
worker in the International Order of King's
Daughters and Sons, holding for six years the
ofhcc of leader of the Inasnuich Union of Med-
fonl.

Unselfish and tender-hearted to a marked
degree, she is beloved by all who are privileged
to know her. To the fact that she is sunny and
optimistic by nature, with the helpful faculty
of seeing always the humorous side of things,
is owing largely her power to overcome formi-
dable obstacles in the line of duty. She is
always just and impartial, seeking ever for both
sides of the question, willing to concede, but
remaining true to her convictions.

Cieorge Samuel Taylor Fuller, of Medford,
her son, with whom she (a mother teiulerly
cherished) makes her home, was born Novem-
ber 27, 1856. He is a graduate of the Lyman
(iranunar School of I'^ast Boston, also of the
Boston I'Jiglish High School. Since his resi-
dence in Medford he has been identified with
plans for the benefit of the city, and has served
as a member of the city government. At the
last election he was chosen a member of the
school boaril. He is corresi)onding secretary
of the Medford Historical Society, serving his
third year in that position. September 19,
1887, he married Ella Jane Prescott, of Exeter,
N.H., who also conies of Revolutionary ances-
tors. They have one son, George Prescott
Fuller, a patriotic lad, interesteil in all that
jiertains to the American flag anil its defenders.



GRACE ATWOOD POPE was born in
the historic town of Plymouth, Mass.,
being the daughter of Edward B. and
Deborah Cilley (Pratt) Atwood. She
married in 1893 John Parker Pope, the son of
Colonel Pope of the Marine Corjjs. On the
maternal side she traces her ancestry back to
a number of the "Mayflower" Pilgrims, among
them, to mention but a few, l)eing Dr. Sanuiel
Fuller, William Brewster, Francis Eaton,
Stephen Hopkins, and Isaac Allerton. The
following is a recortl of the Fuller line: —



360



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Dr. Samuel Fuller ilied in 1633. The Rev.
Samuel Fuller, born in 1625, his son by his
third wife, Britlget Lee, was minister at Middle-
boro. Samuel Fuller, third, born in 165S, son
of the Rev. Samuel and his wife Elizabeth,
married Mercy Eaton. Deacon John Fuller,
born in 1698, married Deborah Ring in 1723.
Their daughter, Deborah Fuller, liorn in 1729,
married Kimball Prince. Deacon .John Prince,
born in 1768, married Elizabeth Sherman.
Mercy I'rince, born hi 1793, married Hervey
Cushman, a lineal descendant of Robert Cush-
man through his only son, Thomas, whose
wife was Mary, daughter of Isaac Allerton.
Eveline Cu.shman, born in 1818, married Lucius
Pratt, and died in 1901. Deborah Cilley Pratt,
born of this marriage, married Edward B.
Atwood, as above indicated, and became the
mother of (irace Atwood, now Mrs. Pope.

Descent from Elder Brewster is through his
son Jonathan,^ whose daughter Mary' married
John^ Turner, Sr. (Hum])lirey*), of Scituate.
Ruth^ Turner married in 168.5 Captain Thomas"
Prince, son of Elder John^ Prince, of Hull.
Job' Prince, son of Ca])tain Thomas^ and Ruth,
married&gt;Abigail, daughter of C'aptain Christopher
Kimball, lived in Kingston, Mass., and was
father of Kimball Prince above named.

Deborah Ring, wife of Deacon John Fuller
and mother of Deborah Fuller, wife of Kimliall
Prince, was a grand-daughter of Andrew Ring
and his wife Deborah, who was a daughter of
Stephen Hopkins.

Grace Atwood Pope was educated in private
schools and at Bradford Academy. She early
showed herself a lover of i)ooks and an original
thinker, with a natural gift for composition.
Her first article written for jiublication appeared
in the Saturday Evening (lazctte when she was
a girl of sixteen. After her marriage she re-
sided by turns in the New Fjigland, Middle,
and Southern States. But she did not din-ing
these years lo.se her interest in educational
matters, books, and book-makers.

Arriving in Boston from New Orleans a hnv
years since, she .saw an advertisement calling
for literary work, and, answ(&gt;ring it, .soon assumed
regular duties upon The Writer. It was while
.she was filling this position that .she was invited
to become editor of a publication just then



coming into existence, The Brown Book.
Declining a post which she felt involved too
much responsibility, she consented to write
for its pages, which she did for two years, only
to become, at the end of that time, its assistant
editor. In May, 1903, she was appointed editor
of Modern Women, a monthly magazine devoted
to woman's best interests, and whose special
aims arc best set forth in Mrs. Pope's own
words in the initial number, here cjuoted but
in part: —

" Beginning with this issue, Modern Wome7i
presents to you a new owner and a new editor,
who beg for your gentle leniency toward their
efforts to publish a magazine for the pleasure
and profit of its subscribers. It opens its
pages hospitably, and hopes to draw around
it, both within and without, many women of
many minds. It will be edited for women
generally interested in affairs, topics of the
home, handiwork, physical and beauty culture,
literature, fiction, and humanity. . . .

" Modern views of life will be presented in
a bright, attractive manner, giving what is
pleasant, and, mayhap, some little which is
not. The g\iiding principle will be to grant
the freedom of its pages to the best thoughts
of the wiiole country."

With her own ability as writer, her unfail-
ing good judgment, and, best of all, her ideas,
Mrs. Pope will no doubt make of thi.s publica-
tion a magazine of wide circulation and digni-
fied standing.



RLLEN VERNOR DELANO, historian
of Thomas Kempton Chapter, Daugh-
ters of the Revolution, was born in
Warren, R.I., May 31, 1848. Her par-
ents were William Sweet Bennett and his
wife, Nancy Wilmarth. On her father's side
she is descended from Edward Bennett and
on her mother's from Thomas Wilmarth.
These two immigrant progenitors, be it noted,
were numbered among the original proprie-
tors of the town of Rehoboth, Ma.ss., which
was incorporated in 1645.

A genealogical work of about fifty pages,
entitled "The Bennett, Bently, and Beers
Families," by S. ]^. Bennett, gives a brief rec-

cnl of the early Bennett generations in Amer-
ica, and states that the family seat in Wilt-
shire, England, is at Pitthouse, also that the
Bennett family had, in the time of Charles
I., considerable importance. Sir Henry Ben-
nett, it says, was private secretary to Charles
II., who was King of England 1660-85. The
Bennett mentioned in the following paragraph,
copied from the same book, nmst have been
living at a much earlier date than any of the
foregoing : —

In 1619, when a chapel in Youghal, Ireland,
was being repaired, Richard, Lord Boyle,
" provided recumbent stone effigies of a man
and woman upon a tomb which bears this in-
scription — 'Here lyeth the bodies of Richard
Bennett and Ellis Barry, his wife, the first
founders of this chapel. ¥w the reviving of
their memory I have had their figures cut in
stone.'"

"The General Armory of England, Scot-
land, Ireland, and Wales," by Sir Bernard-
Burke, has this record: —

" Bennett, Pyt House, County Wilts, a very
ancient family, of which a pedigree of thirteen
descents is recorded in the College of Arms."

Edward' Bennett emigrated from Wey-
mouth, England, with his wife and four chil-
dren, and settled at Weymouth, Mass., but in
a few years removed to Rehoboth, where he
died 1645~6. SamueP Bennett, born in Eng-
land in 1628, son of Edward, resided in Provi-
dence and at East Greenwich, R.I., where he
was a large landholder. He was General
Sergeant in 1652; Commissioner, 1657; on the
Grand Jury, 1661; Deputy, 1668, 1674, and
1678. SamueP Bennett died in 1684. His
son, William' Bennett, born in 1673, married
Rachel Weaver in 1693, and died in 1753.
William^ Bennett, born June 3, 1694, son of
A\'illiam' and Rachel, married Jane Sweet, of
Warwick, R.I., March 19, 1723. Their son
Benjamin^ married January 1, 1770, Anna
Miller, of Fall River, antl had a son. Sweet
William" Bennett (born August 9, 1779, died
April 27, 1858), whose wife was Mary Boomer,
of Fall River. William' Sweet Bennett, born
March 30, 1811, .son of the last named couple,
married January 21, 1838, Nancy Wihiiarth,
whose birth in Uxbridge, Mass., occurred June



6, 1813. He died October 14, 1884, his wife
surviving him until May 10, 1900.

Thomas' Wilmarth .settled in Braintree, Mass.,
in March, 1638. Later he moved to Rehoboth,
where he was a man of imjjortance. His wife
Elizabeth died in 1676. Thomas Wilmarth,
Jr.,^ of Rehoboth, married Mary Robinson,
June 7, 1674. Their son Sanmel,' born Au-
gust 30, 1688, married June 22, 1719, Eliza-
beth Chubb, and had a son John,* whose birth
date was August 12, 1727. He was married
February 20, 1761, to Phcebe Briggs. Their
son Preston,* who was born September 24,
1772, and tiled in 1841, married Desire Fuller,
January 3, 1798. Their daughter Nancy" mar-
ried William Sweet Beimett in Fall River, and
was the mother of Ellen Wrnor, the subject
of this sketch, who married Mo.ses Abbott
Delano in Acushnet, October 9, 1872.

Mns'. J*]llen V. Delano was educated in the
public schools of Fall River and New Bedford,
taking a three years' course in the New Betlfortl
High School. She has practically been a stu-
tlent, especially of metaphysics, all her life.
She is a firm believer in Christian Science, is
a member of the Mother Church in Boston,
and for tlie last ten years has practised heal-
ing, in all of which time she has never lost a
case that has come under her thought.

Mrs. Delano is the historian of Thomas
Kempton Chapter, Daughters of the Revolu-
tion, and a director of the Major Israel Fear-
ing Chapter, Junior Au.xiliary, Sons and Daugh-
ters of the Revolution. Abiel Fuller, her
mother's maternal grandfather, and his father,
Jeduthan Fuller, who married Elizabeth Dag-
gett, are on record as soldiers of the Revolu-
tion, Jeduthan as one of the minute-men who
marched from Attleboro on the alarm of
Bunker Hill, in June, 1775, and his son serv-
ing in August, 1780, in Colonel Isaac Dean's
regiment, marching to Tiverton, R.I., on an
alarm.

Mrs. Delano is a member of the W^oman's
Suffrage League of New Bedford, also of the
Old Dartmouth Historical Society of that
city and a life mendjer of the Cape Cod
Pilgrim Memorial Association. By virtue of
the public services of her remote ancestor,
Samuel Bennett, above mentioned, she is eligi-

ble to membership in the Society of Colonial
Dames.

Mrs. Delano's husband, Moses Ablwtt Del-
ano, is a mining engineer and a thirty-second
degree Mason. He was born in Fairhaven,-
Mass., October 30, 1848. His father, Moses
H. Delano, who is still living in Fairhaven,
was born in that town, July 21, 1820. He
married Amantla F. Eldridge, October 12,
1845. The parents of Moses H. were Joshua
Delano, Jr., who was born in 1783 and died
in 1855, and Eunice Reed Ellis, whom he mar-
ried November 24, 1807. Joshua, Jr., was son
of Captain Joshua Delano, Sr., a soldier in the
[{evolution, who was born in 1746, and died
May 20, 1S19, and whose wife was Patience
Snow. Captain Joshua's father was Jethro
Delano, born July 31, 1701, who married Eliza-
beth Pofje, of Sandwich. Jethro was son of
Lieutenant Jonathan (born in Duxbury in
1647, died in Dartmouth in 1720) and his
wife, Mercy ^\'arren, grand-daughter of Rich-
ard Warren, of the "Mayflower."

Lieutenant Jonathan Delano was son of
Philip De La Noye by his first wife, Hester
Dewsbury, of Duxbury, whom he married in
Decemlier, 1634 (Plymouth Colony Records,
vol. i,). Philip De La Noye (son of Jean de
Lannoy), born at Leyden, Holland, in 1602,
ba])tized December 6, 1603, came to Plymouth
in the .ship "Fortune" in 1621, and died in
Bridgewater, Mass., in 1681. His second wife,
whom he married in 1657, was Mary, widow
of James Glass and daughter of William Pontus.

According to "The Royal Chart of Lannoy,"
in the Delano Genealogy, the line of ancestry
goes back to "600 b.c," given as "the earliest
known date, authentic or otherwise."

Mr. and Mrs. Delano have one child, a son,
Preston lirady Delano, who was born in Phienix,
Mich., April 2, 1886, Mr. Delano being then
superintendent of the Pha&gt;nix and St. Clair
mines at that place. This son fitted for Har-
vard at Mr. Mosher's Hoine Preparatory School,
and successfully passed the examination. He
is greatly interested in athletic sports, win-
ning the silver cup in the tennis tournament
in Fairhaven, Old Home Week, 1903, and the
cup at the Country Club, New Bedford, Sep-
tember, 1903.



ELIZABETH ELLEN HAYWARD, Past
Presitlent of the J. G. Foster Corps,
W. R. C. No. 174, of South P&gt;aming-
ham, Mass., is a native of Keene, N.H.
She was born September 8, 1841, daugh-
ter of Ho.sea and Hannah D. (Britton) Chase.
Her father, Hosea Chase, was a descendant
in the sixth generation of A(|uila Chase, "a
mariner from Cornwall, Englantl," who set-
tled in Hampton, N.H., in 1640, and in 1646
removed to Newbury, Mass. The line is:
Aquila,' Moses,' Daniel,-' Caleb,^ Stephen,^
Hosea." Atjuila Chase married Anna Wheeler,
daughter of Jolm AVlieeler, of Hampton. His
son, Moses Chase, married in 1684 Ann Fol-
lansbee, and lived in Newbiu'v. Daniel Chase,
son of Mo.ses and Ann, married Sarah March,
and eventually settled in Sutton, Mass. Their
son Caleb married Sarah Prince. Steplien
Cha.se, son of Caleb and father of Hosea, was
born in Sutton, Mass., April 26, 1763. He
dieil in Keene, N.PL, April 6, 1830. Bet'sey
Cliase, his wife, was born August 25, 1767,
and died August 12, 1850.

It is of interest to note in this connection
that Caleb Chase, grandfather of Ho.sca, was
brother to Sanuiel Chase, the great-grand-
father of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase.

Hosea Chase and Hannah Drusilla Britton
were married in Keene at the residence of
her brother-in-law, Cajitain William Brad-
ford, November 4, 1833, by the Rev. Mr. Sul-
livan, pastor of the Unitarian .church. They
at once began their home-making in the new
house built by Mr. Chase on his farm in Keene,
adjoining that of his brother Charles, the house
standing on high land overlooking the mead-
ows through which flows the beautiful Ashuelot
River.

Hosea Chase was born in Keene, N.H.,
April 23, 1805, and died November 17, 1874.
His wife, Hannah D., was born in Westmore-
land, N.H., August 21, 1811, and died in South
Framingham, Mass., February 28, 1896. Their
children were: Martha S., who married Ed-
mund J. Perham, and died in 1860; Frances
A., who died in 1867; Hosea B., who died in
infancy; Elizabeth E. (Mrs. Hayward); Will-
iam H., who died at .seventeen; and Daniel
W., who died in 1867 in his twenty-second

year. Edniuml J. Perhaiii in the Civil War
enlisted in the Ninth New Hampshire Infan-
try, and dietl in the service at Knoxville, Md.
Frances Ann Chase taught school in Keene
for fourteen years.

Elizabeth Ellen Chase in her girlhooil at-
tended the public schools of Keene and, for
one term, Momit Ca-sar Seminary, in iSwanzey,
N.H. In early life she united with the Uni-
tarian church in Keene. She was at one time
secretary of the Gospel Temperance Union
of Keene.

On the 7th of September, 1S59, she was
married by the Rev. William O. White to tlic
Rev. William Willis Haywanl. Mr. Hayward
was born in Hancock, N.H., October 17, 1&lt;S;M,
son of Charles Hayward and Ann, daughter
of Jacob G. and Betsey (Stanley) Lakin, the
latter a scliool-teachi'r in her district.

Mr. Hayward's maternal grandfather was
a son of Leuuiel Lakin, a soldier in the Revo-
lutionary army, son of William, the second
permanent .settler of Hancock, descended from
William' Lakin, an early settler in Reading,
Mass.

Charles Hayward, born in LS()6, son of Charles
Prescott" Haywanl and his wife, Sarah Mason,
was descended from George' Haywanl, one
of the early settlers of Concord, Mass., through
Josej)h,^ born in 1643, and his second wife,
Elizabeth Treadwell ; Simeon,^ who married Re-
becca Hartwell; Lieutenant Joseph,* who
married Abigail Hosmer; and Joseph,^ born
in 1746, who married Rebecca, tlaughter of
Colonel Charles Prescott, of Concord, and was
the father of Charles Prescott Hayward.

The Rev. \Villiam W. Hayward was edu-
cated in the public schools, in the academies
at Hancock, Peterboro, and Francestown,
and at the New England Normal Institute
in Lancaster, Mass. For nine winters he taught
in the country schools and for three years
in private schools. At twenty-one years of
age he was elected a member of the superin-
tending school committee in Hancock. He
afterward served for one year as superintendent
of schools at Newfane, Vt., three years as a
member of the school board in Keene, N.H.,
and one year as chairman thereof. Deciding
to enter the ministry, he studied two years



with the Rev. Lenmel Willis in Warner, N.H.,
autl was ordainetl in June, 1859, as a Universal-
ist, at Enfield, N.H. He took a subsequent
course of study at the Tufts Divinity School,
from which he received the degree of B.D.
in 1871, being the first graduate from this
school. He was settled as pastor of Universal-
ist churches at Newfane, Vt., P'airfield, Me.,
Keene, N.H., and in Wakefield, Acton, Me-
thuen, Plymouth, and South Framingham,
Mass.

A resident of the Pine Ti-ec State during
the Civil War, he enlisted in the Thirteenth
Regiment, Maine \^olunteers, conunanded by
Colonel Henry Russ, Jr., and .served as chap-
lain.

While he was in the ainiy, Mrs. Haywartl
spent several weeks with him, literally on the
picket line, at Martinsburg, W. \n., at that
time the base of (jeneral Phil Sheridan's sup-
plies and the object of repeated and untiring
attacks on the i)art of tlie confederates of
Mosby, the noted guerrilla. When Mrs. Hay-
ward went to Martinsburg, firing upon the
night trains on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad
was a frequent occurrence. On reaching the
Martinsburg station at about five o'clock of
a November morning, she was informed by
the officer in charge that the Thirteenth Maine
had left the town. A private, however, cor-
rected the mistake, and to him was entrusted
the task of conducting her through the town,
past .several barricades in the streets, to the
headquarters of the regiment. Mrs. Hayward
was an excellent honsewoman, and soon be-
came deservedly popular with the soldiers.
She assisted the captains in making out the
pay-rolls, and has the enviable record of never
having maile a mistake. She rendered good
service in the convalescent camps and in the
hospital, writing letters for the sick and
wounded and taking care of their money,
which in times of danger she concealed about
her person.

In the various parishes over which her hus-
band presided, Mrs. Hayward was active in
church and Sunday-school work, for several
years being superintendent of a Sunday-school.
An active member for some j'ears of the Wom-
an's Centenary Association of the Universalist



364



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Church, she raised one hundred doHars for the
centenary fund.

Mr. and Mrs. Hayward were graduated from
the Chautauqua Lit(&gt;rary and Scientific Cir-
cle of South Franiinffliani in ISSS. She was
president of the Woman's Christian Temper-
ance Union and a leader in the campaign against
the Tujuor saloons in Framingliam, meeting
with great success. Having i)een selected
by a special conuuittee to write a history of
the town of Hancock, N.H., Mr. Hayward
for seven years devotetl all the time he could
spare from parish and other public duties to
this work. The book was published in 18S9,
and contains over a thou.sand printed i)ages
of valuable material. It is recognized by
histoi'ical and genealogical societies and by the
officials of public libraries as one of the best
town histories ever issued.

In its jireparation Mrs. Hayward rendered
valuable assistance. Diligently searching four
volumes of town and one of church records,
she compiled the list of marriages, nearly a
thousand in number.

In June, 1SS9, Mr. Hayward accepted a
call to the First Congregational (Unitarian)
Church in Medfield, Mass. He won the love
and respect of the citizens of the town, as in
former places where he had been settletl as
pastor. Popular with the young and ever
thoughtful of their interests, he was active
in the guild movement (since his death named
the Hayward Guild) and in temperance and
charitable work. The Norfolk Unitarian Club
was organized by him ; and the various branches
of work, in all of which he was assisted by his
wife, prospered under his charge. His ad-
dress on the occasion of the one hundredth
anniversary of the church, October S, ISSO,
was published in pamphlet form. Mr. Hay-
ward was a friend of the Woman's Relief Corps,
and in 1891 he accompanied Mrs. Hayward,
who was a delegate, to the National Conven-
tion held in Detroit, Mich.

As an officer of the National Army Chaplains'
Association, which he helped to form in De-
troit in 1891, as a Memorial Day orator and
a leading spirit in many philanthropic move-
ments, he was widely known; and his death,
which occurred in Medfield, July 26, 1892,



caused soriow in many sections of the country.
The conmiittee of the church in Medfield paid
the following tribute to his memory: "We
look back upon the years of his pastorate as
years of pros]jerity in the history of this church
and parish and as years marked by dee|) in-
tei'cst in all that pertains to the building up
of true, noble Christian character and stinui-
lating its people to useful Christian lives. We
respected him for his true manliness, dignity,
and unselfishness." The Young People's Re-
ligious Guild remembered with gratitude the
interest manifested liy him in their organiza-
tion.

Resolutions of respect, recognizing and re-
cording his elevated character, his fidelity to
duty, the exalted princi|)les which governed
his life, his forbearing sympathy and good
will, were pas.sed by the Medfield Historical
Society, the General J. G. Foster Post, G. A. P.,
of South Framingham, and by the Relief Corps
auxiliary to the Grand Army post in Milford,
N.H., where Mr. Hayward gave his last Me-
morial Day address.

The Norfolk I'nitarian Conference, in a
letter to Mrs. Hayward, testified that "they
all regarded Mr. Hayward with honor and re-
spect for his sterling faithfulness, his blame-
less record, and his earnest devotedness to
his profe.';sion. His uniform courtesy, dignity,
and friendliness won the affection of all, and
made him always a welcome companion."

A former pastor of the church in Keene
wrote to her : " You have the comfort of reflecting
that you have been a true helpmeet to your
husband these many years. By your energy,
your sympathy, your judgment, your ready
])lanning for the social interests of a ])arish,
as well as for the advancement of the church
and Sunday-school, you have shown a spirit
of co-operation that must have been invaluable
to him."

Mr. Hayward, who had been identified with
the Masons, the Temple of Honor, and United
Order of the Golden Cross, was an officer of
Beaver Brook Lodge of Odd Fellows at Keene,
N.H. He had four brothers, two of whom
are living in New Hampshire.

Mrs. Hayward is a member of the Daughters
of New Hampshire and a charter member of

365



the Historical Society of Hancock, N.H. For
four years she was chaphiin of the Relief Corps
connected with General J. G. Foster Post.
Before this corps joined the National Woman's
Relief Corps (it being an independent local
society previous to 1S97), she was chaplain
for two years of the corps auxiliary to the post
in Walpole, at the same time retaining her
membership in the "Independent Corj)s" of
South Framingham. Since the latter has be-
come a part of the Department of Massachu-
setts, W. R. C, Mrs. Hayward has been active
in the State and national work. She is one
of the official visitors and directors of the
Ladies' Aid Association of the Sokliers' Home
in Chelsea, Mass. She has attended the Na-
tional Conventions in Western cities as a dele-
gate from the Department of Massachusetts.
In 1902 sht' was [president of the corps in South
Framingham, where she has resided since the
death of her husband, and at the close of her
official year was presented with a gold liadge
as a testimonial of regard. A woman of
dignity and culture, she is an excellent
presiding officer. She is a National Aiile in
the Woman's Relief Corps and is now serving
the W. R. C. as one of the National Execu-
tive Committee, being also on the Finance and
Floral Conmiittees of the National Cunvention
to be held in Boston in August, 1904, in con-
nection with the National Encampment of
the G. A. R.



HANNAH J. BAILEY, of Winthrop
Centre, Me., National Superintend-
ent, W. C. T. U., Department of
Peace and International Arbitration,
was born in Cornwall-on-the-Hudson, July 5,
1839, being the daughter of David and Letitia
(Clark) Johnston and the first of a family
of eight children. Her father was a minister
in the Society of Friends, and her mother one
of the most devoted and loving Christian
women who ever helped to make a home. Her
maternal ancestry has been traced back to
Samuel Clark, of whom the compiler of a brief
genealogy issued (second edition) in 1897 says:
"I find that the probabilities are very strong
that Samuel Clark, Sr., came from England



in 1630, the year in which Governor Winthrop,
the Rev. Richard Denton, Thomas Wicks,
and over a thousand others first sailed to Amer-
ica. With the last two named he was closely
associated at Stamford, Conn."

During her childhood the subject of this
sketch attentled the district schools of Corn-
wall, until her parents removed to Plattekill,
in Ulster County, New York, about seventeen
miles from her birthplace. There she became
an eager student in another district school,
to which she had to walk a mile each day.
Afterward she was sent to a Friends' boarding-
school in her native State. Here, as well as
by her own independent efforts, by much read-
ing and in other ways, she acquired a good
practical education, but never ceased to regret
her parents' limited circumstances, which ren-
dered it impossible for her to pursue a college
course. For nine years after returning home
she taught school. She then became the wife
of Moses Bailey, a well-known oil-cloth manu-
facturer, of Winthrop Centre, Me.

After Mr. Bailey's ileath, which occurred
in 1882, when their only child was a boy of
twelve, Mrs. Bailey showed rare executive
ability in conducting his extensive business
affairs. This she tlid for nine years.

Being a birthright member of the Society
of Friends, always strong in its [)eace princi-
ples, Mrs. Bailey is admirably adapted to inter-
est others in the work of her Department of
Peace and International Arbitration. The
work accomplished has been mainly of an edu-
cational character. Peace bands have been
formed among children, clergymen invited
to preach in the interest of the cause, and peti-
tions have been circulated. To this work
Mrs. Bailey was appointed in 1887 by the
National Union and in 1888 by the Wodd's
Woman's Christian Temperance Union. As
a result of her persistent efforts and those of
her co-workers, the Peace and International
Arbitration Department of the W. C. T. U.
has been organized in twenty-eight States
and in the District of Columbia. It is now
organized in fourteen cf)untries, and there are
also many lands in which effectual work is
being done unofficially. The W. C. T. U.
Peace Department has taken part in all the



366



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



World's Peace Congresses held since its organi-
zation. Among its publications are two offi-
cial papers, one for adults and one for children,
and two books called "Voices of Peace" and
"Gleanings on the Subject of Peace and Arbi-
tration." The department, in connection with
other peace societies of the world, observes
the third Sunday of December each year as
Peace Sunday. Able lecturers are busy, going
about a great deal of the time educating
public opinion in the interests of this important
work.

Mrs. Bailey has travelled extensively in
Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States.
In helping to advance other reforms, also,
Mrs. Bailey has been active. Together with
two or three other prominent ladies of her
State, she has been trying for years to olUain
a reformatory prison for women in Maine.
The outlook toward good results of their untir-
ing efforts now seems encouraging.

Mrs. Bailey became president of the Maine
Equal Suffrage Association in 1891, and held
the position for six years. She was one of
the judges in the Department of Liberal Arts at
the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, having
been appointed by the Board of Lady Managers.
At Washington in. 1895 she was elected treasurer
of the National Council of Women for three
years. Similar positions she has held for
many years at a time in the work of her church.
Three times she has received appointment
from the governor of her State to represent
Maine on the National Board of Charities and
Correction.

For many years Mrs. Bailey has been in the
habit of aiding, both financially and by letters
of encouragement and counsel, young people
of limited means who have shown themselves
desirous of obtaining a good education in order
to take part in the work and reforms of the
world. As her proteges pay her back the
money loaned them, she passes it on to other
ambitious young persons of her acquaintance,
and thus the beautiful work continues.

At her home, "Sunnyslope," Mrs. Bailey
practises the doctrine which she advocates so
enthusiastically — the "brotherhood of all man-
kind under the white banner of peace" — and
welcomes guests from every land. Mrs. Bailey



puts her horses, carriages, and boats at the
command of her visitors, while each morning
usually finds her for several hours at her tlesk,
with her faithful secretary sitting neiir, receiv-
ing and sending out letters and other manu-
scripts to promote the interests of the cause
she loves.

Mrs. Bailey's home is delightfully situated
in a town containing five large lakes and fine
mountain scenery. The church of her choice
stands on a slight eminence on the south.
On her beautiful grounds gravel walks are laid
out among choice flowers and plants, with a
fountain throwing up sparkling spray. A
greenhouse joined to the dwelling supplies
flowers all the year around for the pulpit of the
church and for the comfort and cheer of
"shut-in" friends and neighbors.

Mrs. Bailey's friends often remonstrate with
her against the strenuous life she lives, fearing
that her strength may not be (&gt;qual to so much
effort, but she smiles as she replies, "I must
be among those who wear out, not those who
rust out.' There are few, if any, of the philan-
thropists of the world who more enjoy their
work than does the subject of this sketch.
Truly does she live " not to be ministered unto,
but to minister"

"For the cause that needs assistance.
For the wrongs that need resistance,
For the future in the distance,
And the fiood that she cm dc."

SUSIE CHAMPNEY CLARK.— Near the
summit of Nonantum Hill, which marks
a boundary between Newton ami
Brighton, Mass., the subject of this
sketch was born. Her parents, James Clark
and Welthy Jane (Park) Clark, came of sterling
stock in the Green Mountain State. The mater-
nal ancestors, Daniel Harrington and Welthy
(Ladd) Park, were of Puritan descent, the
progenitor of their line, Richard Park, being
a landed proprietor in Cambridge, Mass., in
1636. The paternal grandparents, Nathaniel
and Betsey Clark, claimed for their posterity
a faint strain of North American Indian blood.

As the story has oome down, passed, lip to Up,
from one generation to another, a Ch\rk maiden
was carried into captivity by a chisky chief-
tain in the French and Indian War. He soon
after, most amiably, passed to the happy
hunting-grounds of his race, his captive re-
turning to her people in \'erniont, where his
son, who bore the family name of his mother,
Clark, became the progenitor of a line of male
descendants, each bearing many of the better
traits of the red man, tempered and modified
by civilization, such as stalwart physique, keen
love of nature, unusual strength of memory,
with a marked gift of healing. Miss (^lark is said
to be the seventh in descent from the chieftain,
the towering height of some of her ancestors
being obliteratetl in her very diminutive or-
ganism. She lived in Brighton until her
eighth year^ when, after the loss of her fathei-,
she removed with her mother to Quincy, 111.,
where in the broad, free life of the A\'est the
forming years of her gii-lhood were spent.
When she hail reached the age of fifteen, her
mother was again married to Francis H. John-
son, of Cambridge, Mass., which city has since
been her home.

Always delicate in health and completely
prostrated a year or two after her removal
to Cambridge, Miss Clark for many years was
a confirmed and partially paralyzed invalid,
her opportunities for school training being
thus restrictetl to the high schools of Quincy
and Cambridge. But the Infinite Wisdom
makes no mistakes in training its instruments
for appointed service, and an education was
gained on that pillow of prolonged suffering
which no university could grant — an educa-
tion in the .sense of educing those latent powers
of the soul which can only gain fruition through
the growth of the spiritual or psychic nature,
thus encouraged by enforced seclusion from
the world of physical and mental activity. It
was a hard and painful curriculum, one sadly
prolonged by ignorance concerning the power
of the spirit to dominate physical conditions
and by unconsciousness of her own innate gifts
of healing. But there came an hour, as she
approached her third decade, when the purpose
to be thus wrought seemed fully accomplished,
when from the gates of death, through which



she had nearly passed, she was raised almost
instantaneously, miraculously, as it seemed,
by the agency of a modern exponent of the
science of healing, to perfect health and strength,
an emancipation which, in the many useful
years that have since elapsed, has known no
illness, no pain, or exhaustion, although she
has come constantly in touch with disease of
every kind.

A few months later her own life work of min-
istration to the sick and suffering, of uplift-
ing humanity from physical bondage, opened
before her, a service she might never have
chosen, but she could not be disobedient to
the divine prompting or to the call of human
need. She has never made any claim to public
{)atronage or recognition, but has performed
lier mission unobtrusively, courting obscurity
rather than popularity. Her name has never
appeared among the advertisements in the
press or on any door, at home or abroad; and
no cure among her many phenomenal cases
has ever been publicly reportetl. Yet many
of the most noted authors, editors, and pro-
fessional literati of the country are numbered
among her grateful patrons, while the poor and
the destitute have likewise abundantly shared
in her ministrations. That her success has
been unvarying, she claims is due to the fact
that the element of personal effort is so largely
eliminated from her work. She feels that the
healing is done through her instrumentality,
not by her, through a baptism from the one
Power in the universe, with whom " all things
are possible." Through her psychometric gift,
or by the u.se of the soul's sense of touch, she
has made accurate diagnoses of internal con-
ditions, reflecting them in her own conscious-
ness as if in a mirror placed in front of the
patient. Psychic or soul healing, she claims,
reaches the realm of causation, and gains
at-one-ment with the hidden springs of Being
as does no other method.

Miss Clark is allied with none of the modern
healing cults. Christian, mental, or divine
science, her work being representative of a
distinct and individual type. For eighteen
years she has labored constantly, in season and
out of season, not alone in Boston and its
extended suburbs, but in New York, Brook-

lyn, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, and
throughout California, where during five winters
she has had a large and successful practice.
She has also lectured widely in the cities above
mentioned on spiritual and ethical topics,
teaching many classes, outlining her gospel
of health, presenting spiritual truth and the
true science of Being through color symbolism
and also through musical vibrations, inter-
pretations which have proved very helpful
to the many lives thus blessed and uplifted.
For a time she held in Boston regular Sunday
services, which served as a means of growth
and refreshment to interested auditors. Of
late, public speaking on a wide range of sub-
jects has largely taken the place of the work of
healing, though this duty can never be wholly
laid aside. She claims that the true doctor,
as the name (docere, to teach) implies, nmst
ever be an efficient teacher.

Miss Clark wields also a prolific pen, and
some of her books have become household
benefactors. Not a few instances have been
reported where marked healing has occurred
from reading her early volume, "A Look LTp-
ward," a book which had to be replaced in the
Boston Public Library because the first copy
was worn out by constant use. Other similar
works of hers are entitled "To Bear Witness,"
"Pilate's Query," "The Melody of Life," and
"Key-notes for Daily Harmonies." To quote
from the New York Press: " Miss Clark presents
her gospel in language quite free from the
illogical and dogmatic statements of some
writings in this line, and with the clear touch
of psychic illumination which many others
lack. Her message is one of life, of liberty,
of purity, health, and the most exalted s])irit-
uality. It is a sincere, earnest, and heljjful
endeavor to raise mortals above the low mate-
rial plane on which too many are content to
exist and toil and suffer." In lighter vein
she has written spicy sketches of travel in
"The Round Trip from the Hub to the Golden
Gate," "Lorita, an Alaskan Maiden," and
" Souvenirs of Travel." Among her metaphysi-
cal pamphlets are included "What is Thought?"
"The New Renaissance," "Is it Hypnotism?"
"Metaphysical Queries," and "Short Lessons
in Theosophy." Much editorial work has also



been done by her on various journals and
magazines.

Among Miss Clark's possessions are artistic
gifts, whose unfoldment and exercise are held
in abeyance by the more important humanita-
rian impulse and need. She has crossed the
continent ten times, and visited every State
and Territory in the Union, even Alaska being
to her familiar ground. It is perhaps safe
for the writer to ]jredict that the major por-
tion of Miss Clark's spiritual and literary
work still awaits her. c. s. c.



1IZZIK ALLEN PACKARD was born
in Falmouth, Me., in 1853, the daugh-
^ ter of Reulien Allen and his wife,
Emily J. Allen, who was a woman of
sterling character.

Lizzie Allen was educated in the public
schools of her native town and at Westbrook
Seminary, where she was a student for two
years. She was married in March, 1872,
to Samuel Adams Packard, who belongs to
a well-known Maine family, and who is one
of the oldest active practitioners of dentistry
in Portland. Seven chiklren have been born
of their union, and six of them are living.

Socially Mrs. Packard is a favorite, and
takes an interest in all the (juestions of the
ilay. She is a woman of attractive personality,
and makes an excellent presitling officer.
She is now president of the A. B. C. Klass,
a woman's club which has an interesting
history, and is named for Mrs. A. B. C. Keene,
a cultivated woman, formerly of Bangor,
under whose leadership in that city the earlier
classes for home study were formed. Mrs.
Packard is also treasurer of the Mentone
Club, which, since its inception six years
ago, has had for its course of study the history
of Maine. P'or some years Mrs. Packard
has been active in the work of the Samaritan
Association, one of the oldest charities in
Portland. Conspicuous among her good
deeds is the efficient work she did during .
tlie year 1899 in the line of school-room deco-
ration. Any stranger going into the Deering
High School or the Saunders Street Primary
School finds evidence of nmch thorough,

painstaking labor, the walls being adorned
with valuable pictures, which delight and
educate the pupils. It was no easy matter
to obtain these. Mrs. Packard knows how
many hours of persuasive talking were needed
at first to arouse any enthusiasm, how per-
sistently contributions were sought, and what
numerous entertainments were given before
funds were forthcoming with which to
purchase them. During this year of exacting
toil she proved herself an energetic and untiring
worker. The results are certainly gratifying.
During the eleven years that Dr. Packard
was a member of the Deering Board of Edu-
cation, he found his wife always interestetl
in the plans which pointed toward better
methods and higher aims in the local .schools.
Essentially a lover of children, she is am-
'bitious for them, and rejoices in their ever-
increasing advantages.

Mrs. Packard has always proved herself
a devoted home-maker and housekeeper.
In her private life those who know her best
esteem her most. Dr. and Mrs. Packard
attend the Congregational church.



SUSAN B. ANTHONY, in virtue of her
birtli, her parentage, her six years of
budding childhood |)assed nt the foot of
"Old Greylock" in the Berkshire range
of hills, also through the residence of her an-
cestors in direct line, both maternal and pater-
nal, with most if not all of their kith and kin,
for seven generations, in Rhode Island or South-
eastern or Western Massachusetts, may be
justly claimed as a New England woman.

Daughter of Daniel and Lucy (Read) An-
thony, she was born at Adams, Mass., Febru-
ary 15, 1820, and was named for an aunt,
Susan Anthony Brownell. Th(&gt; history of the
family in America l)egins with the arrival at
Portsmouth, R.I., in 1634, of John Anthony,
a native of Hempstead, England, and then
twenty-seven years of age. He served the
colony as a Deputy, 1666-72. He had three
sons — John, Jr., Joseph, and Aljraham — and
two daughters.

John, Jr., was the father of Albro' Anthony,
whose daughter ]&lt;]lizabeth,'' born in 1728,



married a Scotsman, Gilbert Stuart, Sr., and
became the mother of Gilbert Stuart, born in
1755, the great portrait painter.

From John Anthony, the immigrant, to
Daniel Anthony, of Adams, Mass., the line
appears (from the printed records consulted)
to have descended through Abraham," William,'
William, Jr.,' Daviil,^ Humphrey." William
Anthony, son of Abraham and his wife, Alice
Woodell, or Wodell, marrietl in 1695 Mary
Coggeshall, who belonged to a family well
known in Portsmouth, R.I., to this day.

David Anthony married Judith Hicks.
Shortly before the Revolution he removed
from Dartmouth, Mass., where his son Hum-
phrey was born in 1770, to Berkshire, settling
near Adams. Judith Hicks probably belonged
to the family founded by Roljert Hicks, who
came over in the "Fortune" in 1621.

Humphrey Anthony married Hannah Lap-
ham. Both were birthright Quakers, or
Friends, and she was an Elder, and in " meet-
ing" sat on the "high seat." Their son Daniel
was born in 1794. At the time of the division
in 1826 between the liberal and the orthodox
Friends, he sided with the liberals, or Ilicksites.
He was educated at Nine Partners, a Friends'
boarding-school, and began active life as a
teacher, shortly becoming a cotton manufact-
urer, some years later a farm-owner, and then
engaging in the insurance business, the family
home being successively in Adams, Mass., Bat-
tenville. Centre Falls, and Rochester, N.Y.
Mr. Anthony was a man of excellent business
capacity, true moral courage, and sterling in-
tegrity; his wife, Lucy Read Anthony, a woman
of sweet dis))osition and gentle manners, yet not
lacking native energy and force of character.
Her father, Daniel Reatl, was a native of Re-
hoboth, Ma.ss., a Ilniversalist in religion, a
Whig in politics. Her mother, Susanna Rich-
ardson Read, was from Scituate.

The removal of Daniel Anthony and his
family from Adams to Battenville, N.Y., forty-
four miles distant, took place in 1826. Young
as she was at this time, Susan had already,
from her close association with "Old Graylock"
— visible embodiment of strength and uplift,
its top seeming to touch the sky — received an
inspiration destined to remain with her through



370



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



life. At, Battenville the Anthony chiUh-en,
two boys and four girls, were taught in a private
school at home. At the age of fifteen Susan
was a teacher in that school. At seventeen
she taught in a family at Easton, N.Y., receiv-
ing her hoard and one dollar per week. The
next summer she taught a district school and
"boarded round," her wages being a tlollar and
a half ])er week. Following that, she attended
successively a boarding-schoc)l. Miss Deborah
Moul.son's, at Hamilton, near Philadelphia, ami a
private school at home taught by Daniel Wright.
Here ended, 1830, her school-da3's proper.
From the first she had shown herself precociously
intelligent, ambitious to learn, and fond of
mastering difficult ))rolilenis.

The winter had brought business reverses
to Mr. Anthony. With characteristic honesty
he turned over his property to his creditors,
reserving only the bare necessities allowed
by law, and in March removed to Centre Falls,
two Tuiles away. For some time after, Susan's
energies were devoted to domestic concerns,
such as washing, cooking, spinning, and weav-
ing, with (piilting bees, apple bees, sleigh rides,
and other rural diversions, not to mention
eligible offers of marriage at this period and
later on to keep life from being dull and pleas-
ureless. Her next school was at New Rochelle,
N.Y. For teaching a sunmier term of fifteen
weeks she was jiaid thirty dollars.

The final migration of Daniel Anthony and
his household, now depleted by the marriage
of two daughters, was in 1845, the journey
being made by railroad and canal to a farm
three miles west of Rochester, N.Y. For
three years from May, 1846, Susan was an
assistant in the Canajoharie Academy, the
principal of which, Daniel H. Hagar, failed not
in after life to cx))ress high aj)preciation of her
ability and services as a teacher. In 1850 and
1851 she was at home, managing the farm, her
father attending to his business in Syracuse.
After one more brief term of school, in the
spring of 1852 she gave up teaching, to devote
herself henceforth with singleness of purpose
and rare continuity of effort to the stremions
activities of her " fifty years of noble endeavor
for the freedom of women," activities thus
sununed up and circumstantially set forth in her



authorized biography (happily not finished),
"The Life and Work of Susan R. Anthony," by
Ida Husted Harper, published in 1898. In these
well-filled volumes, two in number, the leading
facts and events, together with numerous stir-
ring incidents and anuising episodes in her
])ul)lic career, are recordcMl in chronological
order, ])assages from letters and from her diary
revealing more intimate experiences of joy and
of sorrow, bearing witness to strong family
affections and a large capacity for friendship.
The work is carefully indexed, and each vol-
ume prefaced by a copious table of contents,
with conspicuous headings, marking various
turning-points and stages in the life journey
therein set forth. For example may be cited:

While teaching at Canajoharie, Miss Anthony
.served as secretary of the local society of the
Daughters of Temperance; and at a supper on
March 1, 1849, to which they invited the people
of the village, she made the ])rincipal address,
reading it from her manuscript. It was her
first platform utterance.

It may here be mentioned that the Woman's
Rights Convention that met at Seneca Falls
in .Inly, 1848, and adjourned to meet in Roches-
ter, August 2, had been attended by her father,
mother, and sister Mary, and that they had
signed its declaration. Reading with interest



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



371



the New York Tribune reports of a similar
convention in Worcester, Mass., October, 1850,
Miss Anthony " sympathized fully with the
demand for equal rights for women, but was
not yet (juite convinced that these included
the suffrage."

In 1S51 , as the president of a lotlge of Daugh-
ters of Temperance in Rochester, she was very
active in raising funds and organizing societies
to carry on temperance work, and there "first
&lt;lisplayed that executive ability which was
destined to make her famous." Attending in
that winter an anti-slavery meeting conducted
by Stephen and Abby Kelley Foster, she was
so much interested that she accompanied them
for a week in their lecturing toiu'. In the fol-
lowing May she first met I'^^lizabeth Cady .Stan-
ton, who afterward said of her, "I liked her
thoroughly from the beginning." From their
second meeting in the next sunmier at the home
of Mrs. Stanton dated their lifelong friendship,
acquaintance with Lucy Stone beginning at
the same time and place.

Miss Anthony's experience as a delegate
from the Daughters of Temperance to the
mass meeting held by the Sons of Temperance
at Albany early in 1852 would have disheart-
ened a less heroic woman. "Her credentials,
with those of other wonien delegates, were
accepted, but, when she rose to speak to a
motion, she was informed by the presiding
officer that ' the sisters were not invited there
to speak, but to listen and learn.' She and
three or four other ladies at once left the hall."
The women then held a little meeting of
their own, which the Rev. Sanuiel .1. May
helped to organize. The result was the first
Woman's State Temperance Convention. This
was held in Rochester in April of the same
year. At Syracuse in September, 1852, she
attended for the first time a Woman's Rights
Convention. From that convention she " came
away thoroughly convinced that the right
which woman needed above every other, the
one, indeed, which would secure to her all
others, was the right of suffrage."

At the first annual meeting of the Woman's
State Temperance Society, held in Rochester
in June, ISS;^, Miss Anthony was re-elected
secretary, but refused to serve, stating that



" the vote showed they would not accept the
principle of woman's rights, and, as she be-
lieved thoroughly in standing for the equal-
ity of woman, she would not act as officer of
such a society. . . . Miss Anthony, although
a total abstainer all her life, was never again
connected with a temperance organization."
In 1854 Judge William Hay, of Saratoga,
brought out a new edition of his romance,
"Isabel d' Avalos," dedicated as follows: —

TO
SUSAN n. ANTHONY

Whose earnestness of purp&lt;)se, honesty of intention,
unremittin;^ industry, indefatigable perseverance, and
extraordinary business talent are .surpassed only by
the virtues of her life, devoted, like that of Dorothea
Dix, to the cause of humanity.

In the winter of 1861 a number of aboli-
tionists under the leadership of Susan B. An-
thony planned a series of meetings to be held
in the State of New York. In the small towns
the meetings passed off quietly; but in every
city, from Buffalo, where the first one was held
on January 3, to Albany, they were broken up
by mobs. At Albany the Democratic mayor,
George H. Thacher, true to his oath to support
the Constitution of the United States and the
State of New York, aimounced to their op})o-
nents his intention of protecting them in the
right of speech. On the day apjwinted Asso-
ciation Hall was filled to the doors. "The
mayor went on the i)latform, ami announced
that he had placed policemen in citizens'
clothes in various parts of the hall, and that
whoever made the least disturbance would be
at once arrested. Then he laid a revolver
across his knees, and sat during the morning,
afternoon, and evening sessions. Several
times the mob broke forth, and each time
arrests were promptly made. Toward the
close of the evening he said to Mi.ss Anthony,
'If you insist upon holding your meetings to-
morrow, I shall still protect you; but, if you
will adjourn at the clo.se of this session, I shall
consiiler it a personal favor.' Of course, she
willingly acceded to his request." This closed
the series of conventions. Inmiediately after-
ward the State Woman's Rights Convention



372



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



was held in Albany, February 7 and S, and this
was the last of those conventions for five years.

In the summer of 1862 Miss Anthony attended
her last State Teachers' Convention, which
was held in Rochester. For ten years she had
kept up her membership dues, and had not
missed an annual meeting; ami since 1.S.53, when
she first made her voice heard in the tlelibera-
tions, she had advocated the rights of women
teachers to hold office in the organization, to
serve on committees, to exercise free speech,
and to receive ecjual pay with men for ecjual
work.

In the fall she entered the lecture field,
speaking extempore on "Emancipation the Duty
of the Government." A prominent citizen, after
hearing her at Mecklenburg, wrote to her,
"There is not a man among all the political
speakers who can make that &lt;luty as plain
as you have done."

In New York City, at an enthusiastic meet-
ing held in Dr. Cheever's church on May 14,
1863, in a dark period of the Civil War, when
speeches were made by Angelina Grimke
W^eld, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
Susan B. Anthony, and others, was formed the
Woman's National Loyal League, to give suj)-
port to the government in its war for freedom.
Mrs. Stanton was elected president. Miss An-
thony secretary of the organization. Its ftbject
was to secure jjetitions to the Senate and House
of Representatives, praying for an act emanci-
pating all persons of African descent held in
involuntary servitude. To this work Miss An-
thony devoted her energies for a year and a
half, sending out from the headciuarters of the
league. Room '20, Cooper Institute, where she
remained all through the hot sununer, thou-
sands of blank petitions, accomj)anied by a
circular letter asking for .'signers to the peti-
tions. Charles Sunmer distriliuted these peti-
tions under his frank; and on February 9, 1S64,
he presented to the Senate the first instalment
of the filled-out petitions, saying: "These peti-
tions are signed by one hundred thousand men
and women. They are from all parts of the
country and from every condition of life. They
ask nothing less than universal emancipation,
and this they a.sk directly from the hands of
Congress." In August, 1864, the nutnber of



signatures had reached nearly four hundred
thousand. Charles Sunmer and Henry Wilson
testified that " these petitions formed the bul-
wark of their demand for Congressional action
to abolish slavery."

In January, ISfiS, a few weeks after the re-
turn of Miss Anthony from Kansa.s, where in
the fall of 1867 she had taken part in the suf-
frage campaign for woman and the negro man,
was issued in New York City the first number
of the Revolution, a weekly paper conducted
by Mi.ss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton in the inter-
ests of women, George Francis Train and David
M. Melliss, of the New York World, agreeing to
sup])ly the needful funds until the paper should
be on a paying basis. Its motto was: "Men,
their rights and nothing more. Women, their
rights and nothing less." Parker Pillsbury was
one of the editors. The undertaking was con-
sidered ill-advi.sed by the majority of suffragists.
Miss Anthony writes: "All the old friends, with
scarce an exce|ition, are sure we are wrong.
Only time can tell, but I believe we are right,
hence bound to succeed." The New York Home
Journal comments: "The Revolution is plucky,
keen, and wide-awake. Some of its ways are not
at all to our taste, yet we are glad to recognize
in it the inspiration of the noblest aims, and
the sagacity and talent to accom])lish what it
desires. It is on the right track, whether it has
taken the right train or not."

The Independent, in concluding a "breezy
editorial," said, "Its business management is
in the good hands of Miss Susan B. Anthony,
who has long been known as one of the most
indefatigable, honest, obstinate, faithful, cross-
grained, and noble-minded of the famous women
of America."

After two and one-half years of hard work
the Revolution was given up for financial reasons,
Miss Anthony assuming ))ersonally the entire
indcljtedness, ten tliousand dollars. She wasted
no time in mourning over her disappointment
and losses. Alone she started to earn the
money to pay this debt with interest. For an
evening lectiu'e at Hornellsville four davs later
she received one hundred and fifty dollars.
Says her biographer, "Miss Anthony worked
unceasingly through winter's cold and sum-
mer's heat, lecturing sometimes under private



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



373



auspices, sometimes under those of a bureau,
and herself arranging for unengaged nights."
In six years the work was done. On May 1,
1876, she wrote: "The (iay of juhile(&gt; for nie
has come. I have paid the last dollar of the
Revolution debt!"

On November 5, 1S72, at an election held in
the city of Rochester for a Rej^resentative in
Congress, Susan B. Anthony and fourteen otlier
women cast their ballots. This remarkable
act was done untler the conviction that it was
in accordance with the Constitution of the
United States, as explained by Francis Minor,
of St. Louis, Henry R. Selilen, of Rochester,
and Albert G. Riddle, of A\'ashington, all lead-
ing members of the bar, who believed women had
a right to vote under the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. It was also intended as a test case.
Many of the leading ])apers supported her,
but the fifteen women of Rochester who voted
were all arrested. Miss Anthony's trial took
place in June, 1S73, at Canandaigua. Judge
Selden testified that he advised her to vote,
and in a masterly address argued her case from
a legal, constitutional, and moral standpoint.
The prosecuting attorney followed. Associate
Justice Ward Hunt then delivered his opinion,
and directed the jury to bring in a verdict of
guilty. The next day he sentenced her to pay
a fine of one hundred dollars and costs. "May
it plea.se your honor," said she, "I will never
pay a dollar of your unjust penalty," and she
never did. Even by opponents of woman suf-
frage the action of Judge Hunt was denounced
as arbitrary and illegal.

On May 15, 1869, women from nineteen
States, who had come to New York as tlelegates
to the third anniversary of the Ecjual Rights As-
sociation, met and formed a new organization,
to be called the "National Woman Suffrage
Association, whose special object should be
a sixteenth amendment to the Federal Con-
stitution, securing the ballot to the women
of the nation on etiual terms with men." Mrs.
Stanton was elected president, Anna Dickinson
one of the vice-[)residents, and Miss Anthony
one of the executive committee. To the supe-
rior business ability of Miss Anthony as planner
and manager, occupying various ofhcial posi-
tions, the success of the many annual conven-



tions since held by the society has been largely
due.

In November, 1869, was formed the American
Suffrage Association, numbering among its
leading members Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe,
and Mary A. Livermore. The union of the
two societies. National and American, pro-
posed by the American in Deceml)er, 1887,
was effected in February, 1890. For bringing
about this result more credit is acknowledged
to be due to Alice Stone Blackwell than to any
other one person.

Of the new National-American Suffrage Asso-
ciation Mrs. Stanton was the president in 1890
and 1891, when she asked to be relieved on
account of age. Miss Anthony was made presi-
dent in 1892, and held the office till 1900,
when she declined re-election, and was made
an honorary president for life. On resigning
active leadership at the age of eighty, she said,
"I expect to do more for woman suffrage in
the next decade than ever before."

After fifty years of toilsome activity and heroic
devotion to a principle, her cheerful testimony
is, "I do not look back upon a hard life: I liave
been continually at work because I enjoyed
being busy." Conviction that her "cause was
just and she was in good company" helped her
over many hard places.

The .secret of her continuance and her suc-
cess may be gathered from the remark of
Charles Dudley W'arner after a suffrage con-
vention at Hartford, Conn., in the sixties:
" Susan Anthony is my favorite. . . . You
could .see in every motion and in her very silence
that the cause was all she cared for; self was
utterly forgotten."

It was Mrs. Stanton, long-time intimate
friend of Mi.ss Anthony, who wrote of her, " I
can truly say she is the most upright, coura-
geous, self-sacrificing, magnanimous human
being I have ever known."

Work on the History of Woman Suffrage,
planned by Miss Anthony, Mrs. Stanton, and
Mrs. Oage, and which they expected would
be a pamphlet of a few hundretl pages, was
begim on the first of August, 1870, at the home
of Mrs. Stanton. As material for the history,
Miss Anthony had collected and preserved,
during the quarter of a century preceding.



374



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



letters, reports, and other documents, filling
several large trunks and boxes. To examine
and assort these was in itself no slight task. In
her diary Miss Anthony wrote, " I am innnersed
to my ears, and feel almost discouraged. . . .
The work before me is simply api)alling."
The pamphlet idea was soon outgrown. The
undertaking progressed intermittently, differ-
ent writers assisting, Miss Anthony devoting
months antl months of toil, as well as bearing
the burden of the business responsibility, to
the conclusion. The first volume was issued in
May, 1881. The second volume was completed
in April, 1882. The third appeared in Decem-
ber, 1SS6. These three were edited by Mrs.
Stanton anil Mrs. Gage. Their preparation and
publication were made possible by the legacy of
Mrs. Eliza Jackson Eddy. The fourth volume,
edited by Susan B. Anthony and Ida Husted
Harper, completing the record of the century,
was published at the beginning of 1003. In
the account of the thirty-second annual Suf-
frage Convention, in Washington, D.C., in Feb-
ruary, 1900, mention is made of Miss Anthony's
report as a delegate to the International Congress
of Women in London in 1899 ami her descrip-
tion of the reception of the Congress Ijy the
Queen at Windsor Castle. There is also an in-
teresting account of the notable celebration of
Miss Anthony's eightieth birthday.

As we have no warrant for here producing
any considerable portion of the contents of
Mrs. Harper's " Life and Work of Susan B.
Anthony," readily as its bright paragraphs
lend themselves to quotation, the foregoing
glances and glimpses must suffice to represent
that veteran reformer in these pages. In
conclusion it may be remarked that the bi-
ography above named leaves Mi.ss Anthonj"
where it found her — at the foot of Old (jrey-
lock: here, at the ancestral homestead, on the
29th of July, 1897, she attended, as guest of
honor, the annual meeting of the Bei'kshire
Historical Society, and on the following day,
with a numerous band of kinsfolk and friemls,
the Anthony Ileunion, a notable gatiieriiig
on their native heath of many loyal American
citizens, not a few of them true-born sons and
daughters of New England.

M. H. G.



HARRIET AMANDA CHAMBERLIN,
a Past President of Willard C. Kins-
ley Woman's Relief Corps, No. 21,
of Somerville, Mass., was born in
Freeman, Me., October 9, 1837, daughter of
Bartholomew and Mary (Tarr) Clayton. Her
])arents were from Farmingtun, Me. Her pa-
ternal grandfather, John Clayton, a native of
Manchester, England, came to America as
a soldier in the British army, and .served under
General Burgoyne in 1777. He received his
discharge in September, 1783, and not long
after settled in Augusta, then a part of Hallowell,
Me. About the year 1787 he married Sally
Austin. Bartholomew, above named, was
their seventh child. Two sons of John
Clayton served on the American side in the
War of 1812, and twenty-three of his de-
scendants fought for the I'nion in the Civil
War, 1861-65.

Harriet A., daughter of liartholomew Clay-
ton and his wife Mary, was educated in the
l^ublic schools of Freeman and the academy
in Farmington. After completing her course
of study she taught school for two years in
Maine, and then came to Massachusetts.

On January 31, 1862, she was married to

ESTELLE M. H. MERRILL, journalist,
was born at Jefferson, Lincoln County,
Me., in 1858, daughter of Oilman E.
and Celenda S. Hatch. As a child
Estelle M. Hatch attended the public schools
of her native town. At fourteen years of age
she entered Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Mass.,
and upon her graduation returnetl to Jeffer-
son to teach. At the end of two years' suc-
cessful work in that place she again came to
Massachusetts, and taught school for three
years in Hyde Park. She will always be
gratefully remembered as a strong factor in
establishing in the public schools of Hyde
Park an additional course, giving practical
business training, opportunities for which pre-
viously could be obtained only at private
schools.

A lover of nature from her girlhood, when
she u.seil to wander through the Maine woods,
iluring h'cr periotl of teaching in the grannnar
and high school gratles at Hyde Park .she was
fitting herself at the Harvard Aimex and
with private teachers to take a professorship
in botany, her favorite study. She also fur-
nished at intervals articles for the Boston
Transcript, written under the signature of
"Jean Kincaid."

A break in health, the result of overwork,
necessitated rest and change. During her long
convalescence she used her pen more and
more, her first regular work as a journalist
being on the Boston Globe. From furnishing
si«'cial articles she progressed to a salaried
position. Journalism became such a fasci-
nating occupation that, though she was offered
a lucrative professorship in botany in a South-
ern college at this juncture, she chose to re-
main in the newspaper field.

On October 1, 1887, she was married to Mr.
Sanuiel Men-ill, a native of Charlestown, N.H.,
a member of the Suffolk County bar anil of
the editorial staff of the Boston Globe.

Mrs. Merrill is well-known as a leatler and
speaker in the club world. She is the foumler
of the Cantabrigia Club, of which she is now
honorary vice-president; was one of the char-
ter members of the New England Woman's
Press Association and its first secretary: is
president of the Wheaton Seminary Club and

an active member of the Fathers' and Moth-
ers' Club. Interested in many philanthropical
movements, she is vice-president of the Wom-
an's Charity Club and an officer in the Asso-
ciated Charities of Cambridge. She is a pleas-
ing and instructive lecturer on a vari(&gt;ty of
subjects, especially on educational and sociolog-
ical questions.

She has recently become co-editor, with
Dr. Mary Wood Allen, of American Mothcr-
hood, a Boston magazine devoted to the in-
terests of mothers and home-makers.



LAVINA J. SPAULDING (Mrs. William
C. Spaulding), president of the Aroos-
^ took County Woman's Christian Tem-
perance Union, was born in Pugwash,
N.S., but from early childhood has been a resi-
dent of Maine. Her ])arents, John and Sarah
(King) Sterling, were natives of Halifax, N.S.,
and both came of good olil Kngli.sh stock. Her
grandparents on the motiier's side were Charles
and Sarah King, and on her father's side were
Captain John and Margaret Sterling, of Hali-
fax, N.S.

When Lavina Sterling was too young to
remember very distinctly the place of her na-
tivity or to have any strong affiliations there-
with, her parents removcnl to Fort Fairfield,
Me. She was thus reared and educated under
the American flag, and is intensely American
in all her instincts and proclivities.

It was in the pioneer days of Northern Maine,
when the location of the north-eastern boundary
was a mooted (piestion between the govern-
ments of the United States and Great Britain,
that the Sterling home was established in the
frontier town of J'^ort Fairfield. .John Sterling,
the father, at once became one of the feading
men of the little settlement, which at that time
was merely an opening in the grand old "forest
primeval," where a few hardy and adventurous
spirits, like himself, had penetrated the wilder-
ness and made homes for themselves and fam-
ilies.

His house was the central point of the new
settlement and the hospitable abiding-place
of all strangers who cnme ff)r a temjiorary stay
in the little forest village. The locality had



been one of the most imjjortant points
in the famous Aroostook War, when the
State of Maine made its brave and manly
protest against the encroachments of British
greed; and a log fort and blockhouse had been
there erected under Governoi- Fairfield's admin-
istration, thus giving the name to the frontier
town.

liefore the glowing fire of hard-wood logs,
piled high upon the ample hearth, the younger
members of the Sterling family listened to the
stories of the stirring times when the homes of
the villagers were upon "disputed territory,"
and when Great Britain was striving to gain
permanent possession of this fair land. Amid
these healthful natural surroundings was the
youth of Lavina Sterling passed, and within
the influence of these stui'dy conditions was
her character" formed. Here she early imbibed
those sterling ((ualities of mind and heart which
.she has continued to retain, even after the
union with the man of her choice brought with
it a. change of name.

These frontier villages in Northern Aroostook
developed with wonderful rapidity after the
treaty of 1S42 had terininateil the long contro-
versy and established the boundary beyond
dispute. Soon good schools were established,
and, as the ])opulation rapidly increased liy
the innnigration of sturdy settlers, a degree of
culture obtained, rugged at first, of necessity,
but based upon the honest {principle that in
their isolated condition all ilmst work heartily
tf)gether for the common weal.

In the public schools of the town Miss Ster-
ling acquired the rudiments of a good English
education, which was su{)plemente(l by a course
of study in Houlton Academy, now Kicker
Classical Institute. In July, 1865, she was
united in marriage to Mr. \\'illiam Cole Spauld-
ing, of Buckfield, Me., now one of the most
prosperous merchants of Aroostook County.
Mrs. SpauUling had two children, both worthy
sons of a devoted mother. John Sterling
vSpaulding, who, after coming to man's estate,
entered into business witfi his father, passed
to the higher life on December 15, 1896. The
remaining son, Atwood William Spaulding,
was military secretary, with the rank of Major,
on the staff of Governor Powers. He is at the

present time in business with his father in
Caribou.

In comparatively early life, when she w^as
the centre of a beautiful and attractive home,
with a devoted husband ever striving to pro-
mote her wishes, and when two affectionate
sons were in the most receptive years of child-
hood and youth, Mrs. Spaulding became deeply
interested in the aims ami purposes of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union, be-
coming a member in the early years of its his-
tory. To the upbuilding of this organization
and to the working out of its principles she has
spared no reasonable effort. At home, abroad,
in legislative halls, in church councils, and
in social circles she has given voice to her sin-
cerest convictions. Her abilities and thorough,
conscientious integrity were early recognized
in the v*^tate organization, where she has occu-
pied responsil)le otlicial positions. Some of
these she resigned upon the earnest solicitation
of friends (who saw the need of her esi)ecia]
services in the county), to accept in 1SS9 the
county presidency, which honorable position
she still holds.

Mrs. S]xuilding has taken an active part in
all good works and never missed an op])ortunity
to lend a helping hand to any unfortunate
who comes within her notice. At home and
within the thriving village of Caribou her most
active work has been done, and here she is best
loved and most appreciated. It was largely
due to her efforts, aidetl by a few other public-
spirited ladies of the town, that the town library
was first established. This library, ' which
was first maintained as a reading-room, soon
outgrew its original resources, and was turned
over to the town.

Mrs. Spaulding is also president of the Social
Club of Caribou, organized in 1898, is an active
member of the Literary Club, and is in close
touch with all the agencies, charital)le and other-
wise, for the im])rovement of the town and the
best interests of its citizens. In religious mat-
ters her affiliation is with the Episcopal church.

Mrs. S|)aulding is a w'oman of pleasing pres-
ence, bright, attractive, and a most interesting
conversationalist. In giving attention to public
work she has never, in the least, neglected her
household duties. Her charming residence in



Caribou is an ideal home, where all the domestic
virtues are fully exemplified.

This brief notice was written by one who has
long known and loved her, and who.se most
difficult task, in writing these lines, has been to
refrain from too much of compliment and praise,
he being aware that anything like fulsome
flattery would be to her extremely distasteful.

E. w.



ANNA FLORENCE GRANT, printer,
/\ is a native of Portland, Maine. Her
-Z _\. parents. Captain Frank M. and Joan
Morse (Grant) Grant, removing to Bos-
ton in her girlhood, her education was received
in the public schools of both cities. After
her graduation she took a full cour.se at Bur-
ilett's Business College, which she completed
with honors. Her aptitutle for a business ca-
reer early began to manifest itself, and, when she
was only twenty years old, she availed herself
of an opportunity to buy out the printing e.s-
tablishment on Court Street, Boston, of two
young men who were selling out. Becom-
ing proprietor of the entire business plant,
she proceeded to luiild up a trade. In these
times of sharp competition it is no simple mat-
ter to achieve success along any line, and the
art preservative of all arts is far from being
an exception. This Mi.ss Grant, with her su-
perior ([ualifications and recognizing no such
word as fail, has done. Entering the business
without previous experience other than that
gained by frequenting a printing-office and
learning to set type as a pastime, she cjuickly
mastered the details, and became very proficient
in type-setting, proof-reading, making-up, and
printing.

At this time Miss Grant was the only woman
in Boston who owned and operated a printing
establishment — an establishment, too, of which
any man might well be proud, containing large
presses run by electricity and having men as
type-setters and in the shipping-room. Dur-
ing the first year (1891) she advertised largely,
and received orders from every State and Ter-
ritory in the Union, as well as some from abroad.
One important factor in her business is the en-
graving and printing of fine invitations and



378



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OE NEW ENGLAND



cards for weddings and society events gener-
ally. Another department in which she takes
especial pride is that of making blank bonks,
in connection with which she takes orders for
binding, ruling, perforating, and electrotyping.
She has printed everything, from a newspaper
to a label the size of a postage stanij); from
cards to law blanks, pamphlets, and books.

She is stationer for several leading women's
clubs, and does stamping and embossing of
the best (luality. She is a very careful manager,
making all her own estimates and figuring on
contract work. She has many original ideas
about her work, one of her specialties being
advertising novelties. She has also manu-
factured some labor-saving devices for the
counting-room, one of which, the "acme petty
ledger," has met with a large sale. Her present
place of business is at 42 Summer Street.

Miss Grant is a womanly woman, controlling
her office with a dignity and kindly authority
which have won for her the high respect of
all her employees. Possessed of great tact
and the courage which makes stepping-stones
of obstacles, her progress has been steadily
onward; and, with '^Semper fideiis" for her
motto, she has truly deserved her success.

Her work was represented at all the exhibi-
tions of the Portland Society of Art. One of
her landscapes was thus mentioned : " The
live, graceful treatment of the long ranks of
willows, the shadowy foreground, contrasting
with the airy, sunlighted middle distance, all
suggest the great French master, Corot";

San Francisco a critic said, "Tiie man who
painted these pictures knew his Inisiness."

Kinsley Post, G. A. R. This was one of the
first women's societies in Massachusetts recog-
nized as an auxiliary to a post of the Grand

was very prosperous as a local organization,
it decided in 18S2 to broaden its work and re-
organize as a subordinate corps of the Depart-
ment of Massachusetts, W. R. C, imder the
title of Willard C. Kinsley Relief Corps, No.
21. Mrs. Knapj) was a charter member, and

Mr. and Mrs. Knapp have many friends in
various sections of the State. Their only child,
Roselth Adams, was born in Somerville, Sep-
tember 1, 1879. She was married September
17, 1902, to Granville Domett Breed, of
Cambridge, Mass., a direct descendant of the
family once the owners of Breed's Hill,
Charlestown. Mrs. Breed is a professional
elocutionist. She is a member of the Ruskin

ANNA DOW HINDS CHAPMAN, vice-

/\ jiresident since November, 1890, of the
X \. Portland McAll Auxiliary, has a na-
tional reputation as a worker for the
McAll Mission. A resilient of Portland, her
native city, she is active in church and philan-
thropic work, and is also a recognized social
leatler.

Her parents, Benjamin Franklin and Adri-
anna Veazie (Cha.se) Hinds, were both born in
Maine in the thirties of the nineteenth century,
her father being the .son of Elisha and Ann P.
(Dow) Hinds. Jienjamin F. Hinds was for
over thirty years assistant cashier at the Port-
land Custom House. He ilied in 1897. Mrs.
Hinds, Mrs. Chapman's mother, was a woman
of great religious faith. This she inherited
from her mother, Mrs. Sarah Frances Chase,
who was known for her love of the church and
her great benevolence.

Anna Dow Hinds was educated in the
public schools of Portland and at Bratlford
Academy, Bradford, Mass., where she was
graduated in 1872. She sub.seciuently taught
in one of the grammar schools of Portland.
In the fall of 1875 she resigned her position
as teacher, and married the Hon. Charles J.
Chapman, one of the leailing citizens of Port-
land. Mr. Chapman was graduated from
Bowdoin College with high honors in 1868.
For many years he was a member of the Port-
land School Board, a part of the time as super-
intendent of schools. He was prominent in
Republican politics, and was Mayor of Port-
lanil in 1886, 1887, and 1888. The latter
year he was elected by a largely increased
majority, and his administration received the
support of both parties. He was a success-
ful merchant and banker. For several years
he was president of the Chapman Bank, and
he held this position at the time of his death,
which occurretl sudiienly in the fall of 1898.
Clear-headed, upright, and progressive, as
a business man for more than a quarter of a
century, engageil in large mercantile and

financial transactions, and as a public official,
he commanded the confidence and respect of
the entire community. His loss was widely
and deeply felt.

Mrs. Chapman was a helpmeet and com-
panion to her husband, rendering by her
social ([ualities valuable assistance during his
political career. She has had a memorial
window placed in Williston Cliurch (Congre-
gational). It was unveiled the Easter follow-
ing his death.

Five children were born to Mr. and Mrs.
Chapman, and all of them are living, namely:
Marion Carter; Robert Franklin, who was
graduated at Bowdoin College in 19(J0; Charles
Jarvis, Jr. (Yale, 1905); Philip Freeland (Bow-
doin, 1906); and Harrison Carter.

While deeply interestetl in her church and
mi.ssionary work, Mrs. Chapman always finds
time to jilan for her children's pleasure. Her
house in Portland and her sunnner home,
"The Towers," at Great Diamond Island in
Casco Bay, are usually filled with young
people.

For the past twelve years Mrs. Chapman
has been a leading spirit in Maine in the work
of the McAll Mission, to which she is earnestly
devoted. This mission was founded by the
Rev. Robert W. McAll (Congregationalist),
a native of Macclesfield, England, for the
purpose of giving religious instruction, "highly
evangelical and undenominational," to the
common people of France. The wf)rk was
begun in Paris by Mr. McAll and his wife
in July, 1872, and continued by him until
his death in 1893. Dispensaries, industrial
schools, and reading-rooms are sustained by
the mi.ssion, which does not establish churches.
The American McAll A.ssociation, for the
collection of funds, was founded in 1883.

The Portland McAll Auxiliary, for the
same object, was organized in February, 1887,
in State Street Chapel, under the direction
of Professor J. C. Bracq, general secretary
of the American McAll Association. Mrs.
Ellen Carpenter was elected president, and
served until her removal from that city. For
many months Mrs. W^illiam H. Fenn, vice-
president of the American A.ssociation, pre-
sided over the meetings. In November, 1890,



Mrs. Carpenter resigned, and ^Mrs. Chapman,
who had been one of the vice-presidents
since its organization, was elected to fill the
vacancy. The work progressed under her
direction, and the next year a new station
was opened through the efforts of the mission.
For the support of this, in addition to money
given for the general work, one hundred dol-
lars is annually expended. Mrs. Chapman in-
troduced ])arlor meetings, which have been
regularly held. These gatherings are of social
interest and helpful in advancing the cau.se.
In May last the treasurer announced a gift
of one thousand dollars from an unknown
friend. The a.ssociation has al)out one hun-
dred members, and has contributed over
f(jur thousand dollars to the work of missions
in France. Mrs. H. W. Noyes has held for
twelve years the office of secretary of the
Porthincl Mission. At the annual meetings
of the American Association Mrs. Chapman
has represented in an able maimer the local
.society.

Mrs. Chapman is a director of the S. P. C. A.
Society and a member of the Literary and
Benevolent Associates. She is planning an
extensive trip abroad, and during her travels
will visit different branches of the McAll
Mission.



ANNIE FIELDS, author, known al-so
/\ as Mrs. James T. Fields, judicious
X jL helper of the poor, is a native of Bos-
ton and a resident of that city, hav-
ing a sunnner home at Manchester-by-the-Sea.
Her birth occurred in the fourth decatle of the
nineteenth century, her marriage in 1854.

Daughter of Dr. Zalxliel Boylston and Sarah
May (Holland) Adams, she is of the eighth
generation of tlie family founded by the im-
migrant, Henry Adams, of Braintree, who died
in 1646. Her Adams line of ancestry is:
Henry,' Joseph,^ Jo.seph,' Captain Ebenezer,^
Deacon Ebenezer,'* Zabdiel," Dr. Zabdiel Boyls-
ton.' Deacon Ebenezer Adams, her great-
grandfather, was cousin to President John
Adams, the latter being son of Deacon John^
and his wife, Susanne Boylston, and the former
son of Deacon John's brother, Captain Eben-

ezor Atlaius, whoye wife was Aiiiie Boylston,
sister to Susanna.

The wife of Josepli^ Adams and mother of
Captain Ebenezer^ and Deacon John'' afore-
said was Hannah Bass, daughter of John and
Ruth (Alden) Bass and grand-chiughter of
John Alden and his wife Priscilla. Sure enough,
then, is Annie J'ields, poet and friend of poets,
a "Mayflower" descendant.

Mrs. Fields's maternal grandparents were
Captain John and Saraii (May) Holland, the
grandfather a Boston merchant and ship-
owner. The grandmother was a daughter of
SamueP and Abigail (Williams) May. She was
sister of Joseph'' May, wlio.se daughter Ai.iigaiP
married Amos Bronson Alcott and was the
mother of Louise May Alcott; and sister to
Joseph" May's brother Sanuiel, who married
Mary Goddard and was the father of Abby W.
May of honored memory.

For years Mrs. James T. Fields has been one
of the leading workers in the A.s.sociated Char-
ities of Boston, in which organization she has
served as vice-president and director, and as
corresponding secretaiy of District No. 7,
giving much time and energy to the study of
social and economic (|uestions and the practical
work of befriending the poor.

The writings of Mrs. Fields i)etray a cul-
tivated mind, a wide ac&lt;iuaintanc4' and loving
intimacy with books ami their producers, and
possess a literary and person;d flavoi- of un-
failing charm. It may be noted in passing
that one of the teachers by whose instructions
she profited in her youth was George B. I']merson,
who for a number of years kept an excellent
private school in Boston. Mrs. Fields has been
a contributor to the Atlaiilic, Ilar/ier's, the
CcnluTjj, and other magazines. Her first book
of poems, "llnder the Olive," was followed l)y
a memoir of her husband, entitled "James T.
Fields: Biograjjliical Notes and Per.s(jnal
Sketches, with Unpublished Fragments and
Tributes of Men and W'omen of Letters," 1881;
"How to help the Poor," 1883; "Whittier:
Notes of his Life and Frien.l.ships," 1893:
"A Shelf of Old Books," 1894: "The Singhig
Shepherd, and Other Poems," 1895; "Authors
and Friends," 1896; "Life and Letters of
Harriet Beecher Stowe," 1897; "Hawthorne,"



in the Beacon Biographies, 1899 ; " Orpheus,
a Mas(iue," 1899.

Early in the present year, 1904, after an
interim of impaired health and cessation of
literary activity, appeared from the pen of
Mrs. P'ields a little volume on Charles Dudley
Warner, in the Contemporary Men of Letters
Series. What was said by a competent critic
of her "Authors antl Friends" may here be
cited as applicable to this attractive monograpli
of later date: —

"It is because Mrs. Fields herself was born
just early and just late enough, and through
circumstance and native endowment came
into the closest intimacy and sympathy with
the men and women whose names shine forth
most clearly in our century's record of letters,
that her book has an unconunon charm and
value." M. H. G.



GEORGIA ABBIE RUSSELL, Agent
for the Massachusetts State Board
of Prison Conmiissioners, has for
the past six years had charge of
the work of aiding discharged female prisoners.
She is a daughter of George Woodliury and
Abigail (Bunker) Russell. When she was two
weeks old, her mother died, and her father,
a few months later, went to California, leav-
ing her in charge of Benjamin Bunker, an
uncle, whose wife, Elizabeth Ober Burnham,
was her mother's cousin.

George Woodbury Rus.sell, her father, who
was born in vSalem, Mass., and was for many
years a sea captain, died in California when
she was seven years old. His ancestors were
men of prominence in the army and navy,
and the family was noted for its charitable
deeds. Miss Russell remembers accompany-
ing her aunt and grandmother to homes of
the sick and afflicted, and she was often sent
on errands of mercy. Mrs. Abigail Bunker
Russell, the mother above named, was born
in Beverly, Mass. She also was descended
from a family interested in charitable works.
Miss Russell's grandfather Bunker was a
gunner in the navy during the Revolution,
and her great-grandfather was' the owner
of the farm in Cliarlestown on which Bunker



384



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Hill is situated. His wife was one of the
Breed family whose farm joined that of the
elder Bunker. Their fiekls, inclutling the
memorable Breeil's Hill, were the scenes of
sanguinary strife in those dark days.

Miss Russell, in referring to her aunt under
whose care she was placed when an infant,
says: "She eventually proved her worth as
mother and friend. Blessed remembiance of
that dear soul, whose noble Christian life
was one long sacrifice for others, was an in-
centive to me to imitate her exam[)le. The
tenacity with which she clung to her friends
was a marked trait in her character, she being
always a sunbeam in their presence. Her
cheerful, warm-hearted greeting, her unselfish
deeds of kindness, her tender interest in the
welfare of her friends, her hopeful si)irit,
and unassuming and sustaining religious
faith and Christian life will ever be remem-
bered by all who were brought in contact with
her."

With the exception of three years of public
school life, Miss Russell received her education
in private schools, completing it in Phila-
delphia in 1871. The following year she
entered the pension ofhce in Boston, and
served under the administrations of Dr. Phelps,
the Hon. D. W. Gooch, and General B. F.
Peach. Plfteen years of that time she was
chief clerk of the Pension Bureau. In 1898
she entered the service of the Prison Com-
missioners at the State House as Miss Frye's
successor. In continuing the work as Agent
for Discharged Female Prisoners she has aimed
to instil into the minds of unfortunate women
the necessity of being self-respecting and self-
supjjorting.

In her first report to the Board of Commis-
sioners she said: —

"On January 20, 1898, Miss Sarah Kllen
Frye closed her labors for discharged prisoners.
For weeks prior to that time her failing strength
had demanded rest, which her energy and
devotion to her work forbade. On that day,
however, she became seriously ill, and on
the fourth day of March the end came. As
her successor, I fully appreciate her labor
of love, and realize through personal experi-
ence the responsibility and immensity of her



work. Four hundred and thirty-nine women
have been furnished with work since February
9, 1898. Contrary to the usual custom of
giving office fees, which is often a source
of temptation, I go with them to the employ-
ment bureau, or previously arrange for them,
so that no money shall pass through their
hands. Many letters have been written to
hotels and private homes for positions for
these women, thus saving many office fees.
After a home or work has been provided,
the interest does not cease here, as visits
are made at their homes as far as practicable,
a corres]&gt;ontlence is kept up with a large
number, and it is found that the attention
is not wholly lost, for many appreciative
letters are returned to the office.

"Seven hundred and two letters have been
sent to these women. Seventy-eight girls
have been sent to home and friends, five
sent to hospitals, and two to the Home of
the Good Samaritan.

" ^^'hen it is considered what a large amount
of investigation is required to enable the
agent to deal intelligently and fairly with
the gi'eat number of cases constantly demanding
attention, besides the clerical work of the
office, I find that the days are not long enough
to accomplish all I would wish.

"To lift fallen womanhood out of the slough
of despair, and lead her to a realizing sense
that she possesses within herself the elements
of a nobler life, is to accomplish much in this
field of labor. This point once reached, to
perfect the rest is only needed the helping
hand which will aid her to become self-support-
ing. It is impossible to sum up the results
of the work. However, this comforting
thought comes to me: 'Daughter, be not
dismayed by the painful labors which thou
hast undertaken for me, but let my promise
strengthen and comfort thee in all events.' "

Extracts from the last report given by
Miss Rii.ssell, under date October 1, 1902,
also show the spirit, untiring zeal, and success
with which she labors: —

"Time has brought us to the close of another
year, and we gratefully acknowledge that
the hand of the Lord has been with us, and
that much good has been accomplished.

" I assume at the start that every woman
who obeys the moral law and earns an honest
living is a benefit to the world; that, disregard-
ing higher motives, to make of a dischargetl
prisoner such an individual, rather tiian an
outcast, a pauper, or a confirmed criminal,
is, as a matter of business, profitable; that
the average prisoner at the time of tlischarge,
staniling at a point where the downward
patli opens smooth and broail and the uinvard
ruggetl and narrow, recjuires assistance —
assistance of such a kind and given in such
a manner as experience has shown that each
particular case requires. This assistance the
State has generously given to the cause of
humanity, antl for liumanity's sake the Re-
deemer suffered.

"As to the desired end, there is, among
civilized ])eople in a Christian lantl, no chance
for controversy: the only possible contention
is, how that end may best be attained.

"There are women to whom imprisonment
has meant something, who if they have sinned
have also suffered, who.se repentance is sincere,
and who desire to live l)lamelessly in the
future. Of this class 1 recall sixty-seven
cases. This number may appear small, but
the future of every one of these was in peril;
and who shall jjlace a value upon a human
soul? It was the one lost sheep, and not
the ninety and nine safely within the fold,
for which the Shepherd concerned himself.
I recall three instances of the power of divine
Love. One case was that of a girl who came
to me a year ago, somewhat under the influence
of liquor, and asked me to save her from
her friends. I took her to a place of safety,
where I could watch over her, and in due
course of time sent her to a Christian home
in Kansas, where she is making for herself
a name above reproach.

" Another case was of a girl now being
educated for a missionary. Still another
started last week for the South, to become
a teacher in a .school for girls. These living
testimonies and the thought of my Master's
example give me courage to press on with
renewed effort and watchfulness over these
hopeful ca.ses, to make for them a living reality
of the words of the Master when he said,



' Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'

" Do this, antl to many a storm-beaten
spirit the midnight darkness of despair will
be illumined by the bright sun.shine of hope
fulfilled. Of one thousand five hundred and
seven women who have been helped this year,
eight hundred and ninety-three have been
furnished employment, four hundred and
twenty-six sent to home and frientls, one
lumdred and two sent to hospitals, seven
sent to insane asylums, fifty-eight have died,
and twenty-one have been married."

Miss Russell is a Roman Catholic in her
religious faith. She is a member of the Mon-
day Evening Club of Boston. She is greatly
interestetl in the Twentieth Century Club
and in all well-advised efforts for the advance-
ment of woman.



MARGARET J. MAGENNIS is one of
the best known and most highly
respected and beloved among the
newspaper women in Boston. In
her honor a room was detiicated by the Massa-
chusetts Flower Mission of the W. C. T. U.
at the New England Home for Deaf Mutes,
Allston, on July 11 of the present year, 1904.
This tribute is significant of one among the
many worthy benevolent enterprises for which
Mrs. Magennis has worked with pen and voice.
Her literary aptitude was inherited, and she
drifted into the work almost as her birthright.
Her father was Archibald McMechan, of Norman
and Scotch-Irish anc(\stry. He was widely
known over the country for liberalism and
defence of the tenant farmer. Her mother
was Mary Nelson, of Norfolk (England) stock,
of which Lord Nelson was a famed member.
From her grandmother, Mollie Morehead, she
inherited her Scottish blood. Mrs. Magennis
was born in Greater Belfast, Ireland. She
married young, and was left a widcnv at an early
age.

Mrs. Magennis was one of the first repre-
sentatives of her sex to engage in the profession
of journalism in Boston. Her first contribu-
tions to the ])ress ajipeared in the Watchvwii
and Reflector in 1868. She was afterward en-

gaged on a suburban weekly, and in 1874 ac-
cepted a position on the Boston Traveller, which
she still holds.

In the line of special reporting she has done
work such as women seldom enter. For ten
or twelve years she chronicled the proceedings
of one of the municipal courts, and, becoming
interested in the criminal class, es])ecially the
victims of intemperance, for several years she
voluntarily assisted one of the judges in taking
men and women on probation. Criminal re-
porting was at first repulsive to her sensitive
nature, but her loyalty to duty called forth her
unhesitating allegiance. Her reluctant task
became to her an opportunity for service to
the unfortunates of the Tombs. Among the
important reportorial work early undertaken
by her was that of the intiuest on the death of
Katie Curran, whf) was murdered by Jesse Pome-
roy. She described the big guns built in South
Boston, attended yacht races, and has handled
other strong matt(&gt;r.

In addition to her newspaper work Mrs.
Magennis has given time and energy to re-
ligious enter]3rises. She has filled the position
of Suffolk County Superintendent of IVison and
Almshouse Work for the* Woman's Christian
Temperance l^nion, and has made a jilace for
temj)erance in all the penal institutions. For
many years she has conducted gospel services
at Rainsford and Deer Islands, which necessi-
tatefl her leaving her home when living in Dor-
chester at ?ix o'clock on Sunday morning in
all sorts of weather. She has .systematically
visited the Chai'lestown State I'risoTi, the House
of Correction, and the various homes and mis-
sions in the city.

Mrs. Magennis has been identified with nearly
ev(&gt;ry charitable institution in Boston diu'ing
the past thirty-six years. She took the in-
itiative in the first free kindergarten, and worked
zealously for the school established in the pen-
insula. She made the first appeal through the
Traveller for industrial training at the Boston
Farm School, which has been for several years
in successful operation.' When the Massachu-
setts Indian Association was formed, Mrs.
Magennis was appointed on the pre.ss committee,
and was unwearied in her efforts with her ]ien.
She was a member of the National Prison



Association until the Ma,ssachusetts branch was
formed, to which she transferred her member-
ship. As a Sunday-school teacher in the North
End Mi.ssion from its inception, she became
acquainted with Miss Caroline Burnap, the
founder of the Home for the Aged and Friend-
l&lt;&gt;ss Women, and the first fair to aid the work
was held through the efforts of Mrs. Magennis.
She was also instrumental in founding a Home
for Aged Couples and subsequently the Working
(iirls' Home, on Pembroke Street, known as
the New lingland Helping Hand Society. The
Woman's Charity Club and the New England
W'oman's Press Association both claim her as
a valued membei'. She is also identified with
the State Flower Mission work, the New England
Home for Deaf Mutes, and is on the auxiliary
board of the Cullis Consumptive Home.

At the dedication of the room named in her
honor at Allstoi,!, July 11, as above mentioned,
there were many complimentary references to
her good work by leaders of philantlirojiic
movements in Boston. Mrs. Marion A.
McBride, in a report of the dedication cere-
monies which was printed in the Woman '.x
Journal, July 16, said: " If every good work of
hers were marked, there would be lines of
triumphal arches along the years wherein she
has worked in Boston. Strong touches of true
sympathy have given support to hundreds
whose lives have been lirighter for this woman's
thought. ' '

In the early part of her work she wrote a
series of stories over- the signature " Drift,"
which attracted much attention, as did also
her articles on the "Old Houses of Boston and
Vicinity." She is the author of the popular
little book entitled "The Foe of the Household;
or. Scenes in Temj^erance Work." A short
time ago she wrote sketches (illustrated) of the
old masters and teachers of Boston.

Her leisure hours have been given without
money and without jirice to aid others, and she
has always been ready to share with the needy
from her limited income. She is frequently
seen about Boston streets on her errands of
mercy, carrying parcels of clothing for some
])oor woman or child in need.

Mrs. Magennis is a member of the Woman's
Relief Cor])s, auxiliary to the Grand Armj^ of

roll. She conducted all the work of the corps
in an able manner, and endeared herself to the
members by her courtesy, her unselfish spirit,
and devotion to the cause. Although higher
honors have been conferred upon her by the
State Department, she still continues her work
for the Ideal corps, serving on committees, aid-
ing in Grand Army fairs and in all ways ]ios-
sibie for the welfare of the cause.

Fletcher Webster Post sincerely ai)preciates
her efforts in its belialf. As a Department
Aide on the staff of the Department President
of Massachusetts for several years, she officially
visited others corps in the State, serving as in-
spector, installing officer, and in various capac-
ities. As a delegate to national conventions
she has travelled extensively in the South and
West, and was a participant in the late conven-
tion at San Francisco, as delegate at large from
Massachusetts. At two successive State con-
ventions she was elected a m 'mber of the De-
))artment Executive Board, and in 1S92 was
appointed De]iartment Inspector. The exact-
ing duties of this position, wliich required a
thorough knowledge of the work, she ]ierformed
in a jileasing manner.

In the conclusion of her report to the conven-
tion held in Boston she .sunmiarized her official
work of the year as follows: " I have attenfled
ail council meetings; was present at sixteen
social or county tlays; attended sixteen exem-
plifications; instructed four corps; inspected
nineteen corps; was also present as a guest at
the inspection of eight corjis; have attended
twenty-seven receptions and other social gath-
erings; installed ten corps; have written six
hundred and nineteen letters and postals; have
visited in all sixty-six different corps at their
regular meeting; have repr(&gt;sented the Depart-
ment at three county days, also served as dele-
gate at national convention held in Washington,
and performed such otiier (hities as pertained
to my work. For the invitations that I was
unable to accept owing to official work I tender
my sincere thanks. To the assistant inspectors
who have served the Department so faithfully
I also express warmest thanks. To the many
who not only gave their time and strength to
the work but contributed their expenses I am
deeply grateful. The many kind letters re-



ceived front them will always be treasured as
pleasant memories of our year's work together,
and the friendships formed during the year will,
I trust, never be broken."

In 1908 Mrs. Goddard was appointed a Na-
tional Aide by Mrs. Lodusky J. Taylor, of Min-
nesota, National Presid(&gt;nt. In this position,
as in all others, she has rendered adniirable ser-
vice, and has been an earnest officer and a
liberal contributor, never failing to assist the
cause so near her heart. At the convention
held in Boston last February she was elected
Department Junior Vice-President.

George B. Goddard serve&lt;l five years with the
Army of the Potomac. He is a member of
Fletcher Webster Post, No. 13, and is deeply
interested in the work of the Woman's Relief
Corps, assisting his wife in advancing its ob-
jects. He is now a manufacturer of shoe sup-
plies and rawhide goods in Brockton. Mr. and
Mrs. Goddarfl have one daughter, Ida May,
who was born in Brockton, October 21, 1875.



A NNA BARIGHT CURRY, Dean of

/ \ the School of Exjire.ssion, Boston,
X. A. was born June 19, 1854, in Pough-
keepsie, N.Y. She- comes of ai long
line of (Quaker ancestors, broken only once
in two centuries. Her parents, Samuel Car-
penter and Frances (Dean) Baright, have
recently moved to North Adams, Mass.

The Barights .settled in Pleasant ^^^l]ey,
Dutchess County, N.Y., before the Revolu-
tion, on a grant of government land deeded
to them by King George. This homestead
remained in the family until about 1870. Two
Carpenter brothers came to America witli
William Penn. One of them settled in I'enn-
sylvania, the other in New York. Through
the Deans and Mal)betts, on h(&gt;r mother's side,
Mrs. Curry is descended from Josejih Castine,
one of the original nine patentees who owned
and settled the township of Nine Partners in
Dutchess County, New York. Her maternal
grandmother was Helen, yoimgest daughter
of General Samuel Augustus S. Barker by his
second wife. Miss Meribah Collins, of Dutchess
Countj', New York.

General Barker, originally of Branford, Conn.,

served in the Revolutionary War and in tlie
War of 1812. After the close of the Revolu-
tion he settled in Beeknian, N.Y. He was a
member of the New York Assembly. He died
November 19, 1819, and was buried on his
own estate in Beekman. His Revolutionary
record, as given in the Historical Register of
Officers of the Continental Army, is, in l)rief,
as follows: —

"Barker, Samuel Augustus S., (Ct.) Adju-
tant of Douglass' 6th Connecticut State Regi-
ment '2l)th June to— Dec, 1776 ; 1st Lieut, antl

in which General Barker participated may
not be uninteresting: —

Served in the battle of Long Island, August
27, 1776. Took part in the following retreat to
New York and in the hurried retreat from that
city, Septeml)er 15, upon the enemy's attack.
Was at the battle of White Plains, October 28.
In the summer of 1777 was in camp at Peeks-
kill, and was frequently detached our-expe-
dition or outpost duty. Served in August —
October on Hudson in Parsons's brigade under
Putnam. AVintered 1777-78 at West Point,
assisting in the construction of fortifications.
In the summer of 1778 encamped with the
main army under Wa.shington at White Plains.
Wintered 1778-79 at Redding. In the opera-
tions of 1779 served with Connecticut division
on east side of Hudson in Heath's wing. Its
light company under Captain Champion de-
tached to Meigs's light regiment, and engaged at
storming of Stony Point, July 15, 1779. Win-
tered 1779-80 at Morristown Heights, N.J., and
in movements of 1780 served with division on
both sides of the Hudson. On discovery of
Arnold's treason, Meigs's regiment was or-
dered with the troojjs to repair forthwith to
West Point in anticii)ation of ailvance of enemy.
Wintered 1780-81 at camp "Connecticut
Village," near the Robinson House, opposite
West Point, and then consolidated for forma-
tion of 1781-83.

Mrs. Curry's mother has in her possession
a wooden trencher made by General Barker



while a prisoner, during the War of 1812,
on a British war-ship in New York Harbor.

Mrs. Curry was graduated at Cook's Collegi-
ate Institute, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1873.
Before she was sixteen years old, she attracted
unusual attention in the work done at the
closing exercises of Gary Institute. Friends
at that time predicted a successful future in
public work.

Soon after graduating she was tendered a
position as teacher of elocution in the Mil-
waukee Female College. At the end of one year
she was offered the position for ten years,
with an annual increase in salary; but the
desire to study was stronger than financial
inducements, and in 1875 Miss Baright came
to Boston.

Professor Lewis B. Monroe, Dean of the
Boston University School of Oratory, recog-
nized her powers, and under his influence she
continued her studies. In 1877 she was gradu-
ated from the School of Oratory with the
highest class honors, and appointed by the
faculty to represent the class of 1877 at the
first Boston University commencement, held
in Tremont Temple. Her theme on this oc-
casion was "Elocution as a Fine Art," in which
she matle an appeal, not for one art, but for
Art. Miss Baright's enthusiasm on this oc-
casion was contagious, ami an audience of
three thousand responded to her ideals with
a fervor almost unheard of at a college com-
mencement.

Thus Miss Baright became associated with
the beginnings of the progressive movement
in the arts of the spoken word, which has
culminated in the School of Expression, Bos-
ton, of which S. S. Curry, Ph.D., is president.

At the opening exercises of the School of
Oratory in the fall of 1877 Miss Baright, then
a teacher in the school, gave a reading of Mrs.
Browning's " Rhyme of the Duche.'^s May."
The lyric possibilities of the ])oem were com-
bined with the most discriminating imperso-
nation, and all the subtler variety of treatment
brought into unity about the slender thread
of a story. Professor Monroe called her
aside after this reading and .said, " I do not
wish to lo.se you as a teacher, but it is only
right for you to know that your power point's

you to the platform." She did not take up
platform work, however, professionally, but
has directed her powers to train and develop
the art instinct in others.

In July, 1879, she opened at Martha's Vine-
yard the first summer school of oratory held
in the United States. Professor Monroe was
to have conducted this school, with Miss
Baright as an assistant. He was taken ill about
the date set for the opening. He telegraphed to
Miss Baright to go on and attend to the work.
His death occurred on the first day of the
school, and, although several other teachers
were in attendance, indecision and lack of leader-
ship seemed to threaten the disbanding of the
students. Miss Baright saw the situation, anfl,
with her characteristic readiness to meet emer-
gencies, organized the school, divided it into
classes, placed them under teachers, and start(&gt;d
the work, inspiring the confidence that held all
the students assembled at Martha's Y'lnf}-
yard for the five weeks' term.

Boston University disorganized the School
of Oratory, August 22, 1879. President War-
ren advised Miss Baright to take the name of
the old school and conduct a school herself.
As she demurred on account of her age anil
lack of experience, Dr. Warren said : " If you
do not, some one else will who is not as well
entitled to do it as you." Miss Baright, how-
ever, did not take the name of the school of
oratory, but opened classes in elocution and
expression. The name was taken by other
parties, and Miss Baright's career as a teacher
in Boston reached its second stage. •

In 1880, through Mr. W. E. Sheldon, editor
of the Journal of Education, Miss Baright
received an offer of a position in Philadelphia
as superintendent of teachers of the public
schools, at a salary of two thousand dollars
a year, which she did not accept.

On May 31, 1882, she was married to S. S.
Curry, Ph.D., afterward Snow Professor of
Oratory in Boston University anil founder of
the School of Expression, Boston, and on Juno
1 sailed with her husband for Europe, where
they spent several months in travel, retui'n-
ing to Boston the following autumn. Six
children have been born of their union, and
four of them are now living — I'^thcl (iertrudo



Curry, Mabel Campbell Curry, Gladys Ban-
ning Curry, and Haskel Brooks Curry.

In these later years ^Irs. Curry has been
associated with her husband in the develop-
ment and organization of the School of Ex-
pression, Boston, of which he is the founder
and jiresident. The aim of the School of
Expression is to emphasize the educational
value of artistic methods as applied to train-
ing in the use of the spoken word. A delicate
tribute by the late Professor J. W. Churchill
to the associated work of Mr. and Mrs. Curry
as princi{)als of the School of Expression is
particularly interesting: "Fortunate indeed
are those who come under the benign influ-
ence of ideals so pure and noble, who work
upon ])riiicii)les so clear, so sound, so truly
])hilos()]jhical, and therefore so wisely practical,
and who share in achievements so rich, varied,
and enduring. Happy indeed are those who
are guitled in their art studies by the philo-
sophic insight and scientific method of one of
the principals of the school and the beautiful
technique, inspirational interpretations, and
stimulating example of the other. Long may
this brilliant binary star, with its blended radi-
ance of philosophy and art, guide earnest
seekers after the true, the beautiful, and the
good in expressive speech, as they tread the
pathway of human perfection."

Belief in inspiration was Mrs. Curry's birth-
right, and the inalienable right of self-activity
was her heritage. Through her maternal
grandfather, Jonathan Dean, who was some-
thing of a poet, she came naturally by her love
of poetry and the drama. He died in early
manhoo(l, but, even in the days before public
reading had gained popular recognition, was
the favorite in social circles, where he recited
Shakespeare and poetry for the entertainment
of his friends. Jonathan Dean's brothers,
Edwin and Seneca, were also patrons and lovers
of art. One day they brought home a violin,
after having learned to play upon it in secret;
and their father, in the spirit of a martyr,
rak(^d open the coals in the oven, and laid this
instrument of sin upon the blazing embers.
But the art instinct is not thus to be
aniiihilat(&gt;(l. ]'&gt;dwin Dean later became owner
and patron of a theatre, and his (laughter,

actresses.

Mrs. Curry's strongest characteristic is the
harmonious co-ordination of intellectual and
emotional power. Her dramatic instinct has
developed into a deep insight into truth. She
has done some strong creative work in the vocal
interpretation of the dramatic and lyric spirits
in literature, notably in her readings from Mrs.
Browning's "The Rhyme of the Duchess
May," old ballads, Shelley's "Prometheus
Unbound," and Rossetti's "Sister Helen";
of the epic spirit in Tennyson's "Idylls of the
King"; in the blending of the epic and dra-
matic spirit in an adaptation from Homer's
Iliad and modern epic poems.

Of Mrs. Curry as a reader of the Bible, Dr.
William F. Warren, President of Boston Uni-
versity, has spoken unqualified appreciation.
Of her reading of "The Story of the Passion
of Christ, as tokl in the Gospels," a critic .says,
"It is the apotheosis of all art, and reveals in
art the reality of His life." As a teacher. Pro-
fessor Lewis B. Monroe said of her, "She is
the only one who has ever been able to take
classes from my hantls without losing their
attention." And Profe.ssor J. W. Churchill
said, "She is the greatest woman teacher of
elocution in the country."

Mrs. Curry, while not a club woman, has
held membership in the New England Woman's
Club, Cantabrigia Club (Cambridge), Boston
Browning Society.

Mrs. Curry is now editor of Expression, and
has in its columns made an application of dra-
matic principles to platform work. She feels
that hei" best years of work a,re to come.



SUSAN BREESE SNOW DEN FESSEN-
DEN was born December 10, 1S40, at Cin-
cinnati. Her father, Siilney Snowden, was
related through liis mother to President
WooLsey of Yale, President Cutler of Western
Reserve, S. F. B. Mor.se, of telegraph fame, to
Commodore Bree.se of the United States Navy,
and to many other literary and scientific men.
Mr. Snowden was a man of letters, remarkablefor
his fine rendering of Shakespeare, for his use of
English, antl for his eloquence. He died at the



early age of forty-two. His wife, Eliza Mitchell,
lived to the age of eighty. She was the daugh-
ter of Jethro and Mercy (Greene) Mitchell, both
of well-known Quaker families. Jethro Mitchell
was a native of Nantucket and a cousin of
Maria Mitchell. He went to Cincinnati about
1830, and many of his descendants still live in
that city. Through her grandmother, Mercy
Greene Mitchell, Mrs. Fessenden claims descent
from John Greene, of Warwick, from Roger
Williams, from Governor Caleb Carr, antl from
other fountlers of Rhode Island.

At seventeen Mrs. Fessenden (then Susan
Snowden) was graduated from the Cincinnati
Female Seminary, being the youngest member
of her cla.ss. Fond of study from her earliest
years, she had also shown great power for giving
out what she had learned. She began to teach
in the seminary immediately after graduating,
and continued to teach there until her marriage.

She was married March 10, 1864, to John H.
Fessenden, of Concord, N.H. Her three children
— Cornelia Snowden, Elizabeth Mitchell, and
William Chaftin — were born in Cincinnati, and
until they had completed their education the
mother's chief interest was in them and in her
home life. "A genius for motherhood" is
her chiklren's description of her. In 1871
Mrs. Fessenilen removed from Cinchmati to
Sioux City, la. There she remained for eleven
years, always taking an active interest in every-
thing pertaining to that young and growing
town. Its educational affairs were dear to
her, its schools became clubs for study. Its
philanthropic affairs, work for young girls, and
plans for helping the poor and tempted were
always in her mind. Just as in her earlier
years she had not hesitated to express herself
strongly on the abolition of slavery, she now
hail strong convictions regarding woman's en-
franchisement, help for the laboring classes,
and prohilMtion of the liquor traffic. She wrote
and s|)oke on all these subjects.

While living in Sioux City, it became neces-
sary for her to assume the support of her three
young children. Their education was the
determined puri)ose of her life. Accordingly
with fear and trembling, but without shrinking,
she borrowed money and bought out a china
antl silverware estal)lishment, antl carrietl on

a wholesale and retail business. Although she
had no business education, had not even studied
book-keeping, an&lt;l liitherto had been wholly
unacquainted with business, she made a marked
success of this enterprise, and continued in it
until the necessity was passed.

Convinced of the need of organized effort,
Mrs. Fessenden started the Young Women's
Christian Association of Sioux City, whose work
soon had a much wider scope than that of such
organizations in larger cities. The Association
rented an old building, where rooms were fitted
up for the worthy {)oor. One room was con-
verted into a chapel, and religious services
were held there regularly the year round. A
parlor organ, chandelier, and stove were given
by this lover of humanity, and she held herself
personally responsible for every service. During
a season of great floods on the Mis.sissippi mid-
night often found her still superintending the
lighting and heating of the building and the
feeding and putting to bed of tiie hundreds
of homeless sufferei-s who sought temporaiy
shelter. Her own house was stripped of chairs
for women with young children, and she did
her utmost, both as an individual and as Presi-
dent of the Y. W^. C. A., the organization having
assumed the care of these needy people.

Just before leaving Sioux City, Mrs. Fessenden
selected the site and measured the lot on which
was to be built a home for the organization
which she had for eight years served so faith-
fully as President. Here stands to-day the
Samaritan Hospital, carried on by the Y. W\ C. A.
for over twenty years. Although other hospitals
have since been built in Sioux City, this, the
first, still has the confidence and the support
of the community. In 1903, when Mrs. Fes-
senden revisited her old home, the trustees of
the hospital gave her a fine reception in recog-
nition of the fact that to her efforts they were
indebted for the conception of the hosjjital.

In 1882 Mrs. Fessenden removed to Boston
for the college education of her children. Her
two daughters entered Boston University wilh
the classes of 1886 and 1889, respectively, and
later her son with the class of 1894.

After the graduation of her elder daughter
Mrs. Fessenden took her family to I'An-ope, that
Cornelia might prepare herself to take the d(&gt;gree



Ph.D. After six months of study and an illness
of only three days this beautiful daughter was
calletl to a higher sphere. This was a blow from
which at first it seemed as if Mrs. Fessenden
could not possil:)ly recover. Upon her return
to America her friends |)revaile(l upon her to
enter on work with the \\ Oman's Christian Tem-
perance Union. First she was made National
Superintendent of Franchise. In 1890 she was
unanimously elected to the office of State Presi-
dent of the W. C. T. U. of Massachusetts, ami
continued in that oihce for eight years. In
1898 she resigned the presidency to' become
National Lecturer.

At the time of massacre of the Armenians
by the Turks, in 1896, Frances E. Willard and
Lady Henry Somerset sent about two hundred
refugees to New York. By cable they recjuested
Mrs. Fessenden among others to receive them
at Ellis Islanil, and to overcome if possible the
construction of law that might bar them from
admission.

In carrying out her part of this work it be-
came necessary for Mrs. Fessenden to visit New
York three times, consulting with the commis-
sioner of immigration and addressing ministers'
meetings to secure their signatures to a petition
to the United States government to call the.se
jjeople "refugees" and not "immigrants."
By this wording it was possible to avoid violat-
ing a most beneficent law. It was necessary
also for her to secure the signing of the bond for
forty thousand dollars. The W. C. T. U. had
to pledge that none of the refugees should
ever claim government support. W'hen these
details had been arranged, one hundred refugees
went to the Massachusetts W. C. T. U. and one
hundred to the Salvation Army. "With her one
hundred Mrs. Fessenden took the ferry from
Ellis Island, while from the grateful hearts of
those who had gathere&lt;l to help rose the beauti-
tiful " Prai.se God, from whom all blessings flow."

To find work for these refugees ignorant
of the language and customs of our country was
a gigantic task. It fell chiefly on Mrs. Ruth
Baker, the Corres])onding Secretary, Mrs. Fessen-
den's clo.se friend. At one time Mrs. I'essenden
herself had a thrilling experience in rescuing
some of these men from a place whitlier they
had been led by false representations. It

was a stronghold of outlaws in the Virginia
mountains that she had to visit in order to
accomplish her purpose; and it was through
the exercise of the greatest tact and promj)tness
that she succeeded in bringing the men away.

As President of the W. C. T. U., Mrs. Fessen-
den had many interesting experiences. One
of these was when, through the invitation from
the captain and chaplain, she conducted on
the United States warship "Massachusetts" a
Sunday service which was attended by sailors
from three vessels. Another was the occasion
when she presided at the banquet and reception
to Lady Henry Somerset at Music Hall ; and
a third at Hotel \'endome, the breakfast to
Frances E. Willard, at which there were six
hundred guests.

An experience of a different kind, which she
felt her office required of her, was a visit she
made to the slums, that she might see for her-
self life in its various phases. Accomjianied
by two policemen, she spent the entire night
irt the worst part of Boston, visiting Cliinose
and Italian quarters, police stations, and so-
called hotels.

In 1899 Mrs. Fessenden had a second great
loss in the death of her only son, AVilliam Chaffin
Fessenden, who had been graduated from An-
dover in 1898, and had entered upon his first
pastorate at New Boston, Mass. He was a
young man of high promise, both as preacher
and thinker.

Mrs. Fe.ssenden herself has frequently re-
sponded to invitations to preach in Congre-
gational, Baptist, and Methodist pulpits.
When only twelve years old, she united with
the Presbyterian church, at a time when young
people were rarely admitted to church member-
ship.

At present Mrs. Fes.senden is Vice-President
of the Massachusetts Woman's Suffrage Asso-
ciation, National Lectiwer for the W. C. T. U.,
and a leailer and teacher of classes in parlia-
mentary law. She early found that she could
most effectively help the causes in which she
was interested by the spoken rather than the
written word, and her literary work has been
confined to articles on vital subjects and stories
for children's magazines. As a speaker, her
power to hold audiences is very marked, and



people like Dr. Lorimer, Mary A. Livermore, the
late Joseph Cook, and Frances E. Willard have
spoken enthusiastically of her aV)ility. She
has a fine presence, a melodious voice, a logical
mind, and great skill in presenting her argu-
ments forcibly.

Joseph Cook praised her "good judgment,
good taste, courage, and alertness." Miss
Willard said: "It is her good fortune to have
something to say and to say it with clearness
and conviction, wit and wisdom." Neal Dow
said, "There is not within my knowledge a
more devoted friend of temperance, nor one
whose work on the platform is more acceptable
and effective than hers."

CARRO MORRELL CLARK, the only
woman publi.sher of note in the coun-
try to-day, is a native of Maine. Ten
years ago she left the pleasant farm
home in the town of Unity, where she was born,
aad came to Boston, having no definite purpose
beyond a desire to ascertain what chance
there was for a girl whose ambitions reached
beyond farm life. Her bright, busine.ss-like
manner carried her rapidly forward, and she
was so successful in her efforts for others that
she soon decided to rea]) the full benefit of her
energies for herself. Accordingly in 1892 she
opened in her own name a book and stationery
store in the Back Bay, where her patronage
included from the start .some of the most ex-
clusive families of Boston. Of this very .success-
ful enterpri.se -she was sole owner and man-
ager for about nine years.

In September, 1900, Miss Clark organized
the C. M. Clark Publishing Company of Boston,
of which she is the head. This enterprising
house in its first year of existence achievetl the
remarkable distinction of producing two works
of fiction both of which within one month
from their publication were clas.sed among the
six best selling books throughout the country.
The first was " Quincy Adams Sawyer," a New
England story, which came out on November
3, 1900, antl rapidly jumped into the very small
class of books selling nearly two hundred thou-
sand in less than one year from publication

date; and the second was the famous Aaron
Burr romance entitled " Blennerhassett," which
was puhhshed on September 6, 1901, with a
remarkable record — an advance sale of sixty
thousand copies before the publication date.
In less than one week from the time it ap-^
peared in the bookstores this l)(if)k had Ijecome
the best selling one in New York and Boston,
and within a month it was in the list of six l)est
selling books in the whole country. As Christ-
mas apj)roached, "Blennerhassett" was l;eing
produced in editions of twenty thousand copies,
and the one hundred and twenty-five thousand
mark was nearly reached in the almost incredible
time of two months.

A few weeks before starting ui)on this new
enterprise Miss Clark had no more idea of found-
ing a publishing house than she had of build-
ing a railroad. The story of the undertaking
is an interesting one, it seemed such a venture-
some task on the part of a woman, in a field
already so well filled by well-established con-
cerns of wide reputation. Men of long expe-
rience in the business shook their heads gravely
when they heard of tiiis invasion of their hitherto
exclusive circle by a woman and with the work
of an entirely unknown author. Miss Clark
happened to be acquainted with Mr. Charles
Felton Pidgin, and partly from friendly motives,
partly out of curiosity, went to hear the reading
of his manuscript entitleil " Quincy Adams
Sawyer." Its fresh country atmosphere, as
sweetly natural as the breath of the fields, and
its familiar, lovable country characters carried
her mind back to the old farm in Unity.
Strongly impressed with the uniqueness of the
pretty love story and the natural Yankee
humor in its characters and scenes, she came
away from the reading convinced that it would
be well worth while to publish this book.

The great success and wide re|)utation of
the two books above named have brought to
Miss Clark the manuscripts of authors, known
and unknown, from all parts of the country,
and her publishing business assumed such
proportions that in the fall of 1901 she took
an extensive suite of offices in Brown Building,
Dewey Square, Boston, whither she transferred
her business after disposing of her Back Bay
store in the spring of that year.



Greatly increasing business and plans for
several new publications necessitated another
change in March, 1902, since which time the
company has occupied the entire floor at 211
Tremont Street.

In privat(&gt; life Carro Morrell Clark is Mrs.
Charles F. Atkinson, of Beacon Street, Boston,
her marriage to Mr. Atkinson, a well-known
theatre manager, having taken jilace August
24, 1897.

This sketch of Mrs. Atkinson's business life
may well be supplemented by a brief record of
her ancestry.

Her parents, Dudley Perley Clark and Lucy-
Ellen Warren, were married July 11, 1852.
They had twelve children. The father (now
deceased) was born in Unity, Me., October
26, 1824, the eldest son of Cudworth and Nancy
(Perley) Clark. His paternal grandfather, John
Clark, was an early settler in that part of
the town of Nobleboro, Me., which is now
Damariscotta.

In a brief genealogical paper prepared by
a student of the family history John Clark
is designated as a descendant in the fourth gen-
eration of Elisha Clark, who settletl in Kittery,
Me., as early as 1690, and from whom the line
continued to John^ through Josiah,^ born in
1704, and his son Elisha.^

John Clark, of Nobleboro, married Abigail
Bryant. They had a large family of children,
one being Cudworth, named above. Nancy
Perley, wife of Cudworth Clark, was daughter
of John and Mary (Spalding) Perley. Her
father, John Perley, was son of Dudley'* Perley
(Asa,* Thomas,' ^ Allen') and his wife, Hannah
Hale. Mary Spalding was daughter of Benja-
min^ S]3alding and a descendant in the sixth
generation of Edward' Spalding, an early set-
tler of Chelmsford, Mass.

Mrs. Atkin.son's mother is now living at the
homestead in Unity, Me. Her parents were
Phineas Warren, Jr. (born in 1793), and his wife,
Lucy Ellen Tibbetts (born in 1797) — the
former, son of Phineas, Sr., and Betsy (Collier)
Warren ; the latter, daughter of Henry and
Abigail (Young) Tibbetts. Henry Young,
a sea captain, was son of Lieutenant Solomon
Young, of Rochester, Mass., and his wife,
Sarah Adams.

Phineas Warren, Jr., was a kinsman of the
late Hon. Lot M. Morrell, their common ances-
tors being the early Morrells of Kittery, Me.
Printed antl family records and remembrances
show that Phineas Warren, St., father of Phin-
eas, Jr., was Phineas,^ born in Berwick, Me., in
1763, son of Gideon* antl Hannah (Morrell)
Warren and a descendant in the fifth generation
of James Warren; who came to Kittery, Me.,
about two hundred and fifty years ago, and in
1656 had land laid out to him in the parish of
Unity, now South Berwick. From James' and
his wife Margaret the line continued through
James^ and Gilbert' to Gideon,* who married
in 174S Hannah, daughter of John' and Ruth
(Dow) Morrell, and was the father of Phineas,^
above nameil, born April 22, 1763. Phinea.'^"
Warren, or Phineas Warren, Sr., was a birthright
Quaker, or member of the Society of Friends,
but, marrying out of meeting, he was disowned.
He settled in Freedom. His wife Betsy was
daughter of Samuel and Betsy (Stein) Collier.

John' Morrell, maternal grandfather of Phin-
eas Warren, Sr., was brother to Peter' Morrell,
a lineal ancestor of Lot M. Morrell, both John'
and Peter' being sons of John- and grandsons
of John' Morrell, who had a grant of land in
Kittery in 1668. (See "Old Kittery and her
Families," by Rev. E. S. Stackpole, and "Gene-
alogy of Descendants of James Warren, of
Kittery," by Orin Warren, M.D.)

Four of Mrs. Atkinson's ancestors above
mentioned — namely. Lieutenant John Clark,
of Nobleboro, Me.; Benjamin Spalding, of
Chelmsford, Mass.;' Lieutenant Solomon Young,
of Rochester, Mass.; and his son Henry— served
in the Revolutionary War. Mrs. Atkinson is
a member of ' Dorothy Q." Chapter, D. R.



ELLA MAUDE MOORE, author of "Songs
of Sunshine and Shadow," is the wife
of Joseph E. Moore, of Thomaston,
Me., and the chief representative of
that flourishing seaboard town in literature
to-day. Daughter of Samuel Emerson Smith
(Bowdoin College, 1839), she was born in 1849
in the town of Warren, Me. Her paternal
grandfather, the Hon. Edwin Smith, of War-
ren (Harvard College, 1811), was son of Manas-



seh Smith (Harvard College, 1773) and his
wife Hannah, daughter of the Rev. Daniel
and Hannah (Emerson) P]merson, of Hollis,
N.H. Hannah Emerson, wife of the Rev.
Daniel and grandmother of Edwin Smith, was
a daughter of the Rev. Joseph* and Mary
(Moody) Emerson and sister to the Rev. Will-
iam' Emerson, the grandfather of Ralph Waldo
Emerson.

Samuel E. Smith, father of Mrs. Moore, re-
moved with his family to Thomaston when his
daughter was three years oUl. Here she grew
up and was educated in the public schools.
In early life her literary tastes began to ag^ert
themselves in poetic effusions, humorous, sa-
tirical, or pathetic, according to her mood or
the nature of the subject that had awakened
her interest. When but a school-girl, she
composed the verses now so widely known,
and at the time so much discussed, known as
"Rock of Ages," a poem spoken of by the
Lewiston Journal as " the most celebrated
written by a Maine woman." It was the re-
sult of no prolonged or studied effort: it was
spontaneous — in the phraseology of the poem,
"sung as smg the bird.s in June." It was
written, without a thought of its survival,
on the inside of an old envelope, which she
had torn open at the entls and spread apart,
crossing and recrossing the lines to find room.
After she had thrown it away, one of the fam-
ily picked it up, tleciphered the verses, and
was astonished at their merit. Urged to do
so, she reproduced the verses, and they ap-
peared in the Maine Standard.

The poem has subjected the author to con-
siilerable amusing annoyance, for, some years
after it was written, it appeared in The Chris-
tian at Work as the production of a man in
Ohio, who sought to establish his claim by
setting forth some personal details connected
with its origin. It also apjjearetl in a published
collection of poems in the West and credited to
a Western woman. Later on a London lit-
erary journal published a strongly satirical
article in regard to its pretended American
authorship, strangely confounding the poem
with the familiar hynm of "Toplady." The
poem by Mrs. Moore describes the various
emotions awakened by singmg "Rock of Ages"

— in the girl, in "lips grown aged," and "over
the coffin lid"; and only neglect to read the
verses could explain the critic's mistake. Mrs.
Moore contributed for several years occasional
short stories and verses to various magazines
and newspapers, and on one occasion entered
the lists in competition for the prize offered
by the Ymdh's Companion for the best story
for girls. There were seven thousand com-
petitors that year, and Mrs. Moore received
the first prize of five hundred dollars.

In 1880 Lothrop &amp; Co., Boston, published
her volume of verses entitled "Songs of Sun-
shine and Shadow," which has passed through
two editions.

She must be clas.sed among the poets of
nature. A list of her themes would reveal
this, for she sings of trees and flowers, brooks
and rills, of night-fall, summer and winter,
and the voice of spring. The much quoted
words of Wordsworth, speaking of himself,
would truly apply to the author of "Songs
of Sunshine and Shadow": —

The "meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common .sight,

To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light.

The glory and the freshness of a dream."

How clearly this is revealed in the poem,
"To a Flower Painter," one of the best of the
collection, through which breathes a desire
to render immortal the varied beautiful forms
of field and forest! —

"If I had all an artist's vi^ondrous cunning,

The magic of the painter's glowing art,
All the wild flowers of limpid brooklets running,

All blossoms of the field and wood a part —
The buttercup with disc of sunny yellow,

The l)los.s()m of the wind-flower frail and fair,
The honeyed clover that the brown bees fellow.

The columbine that sways the summer air —
Pd paint them all on tablet, panel, (lortal,
And render them immortal.

"I'd whisper to the lily, standing stately

In fair, unconscious grace.
Or to the sweet wild rose ablu.shing greatly,

'Bend down, O queen, bend down a little space,
That I may read the beauty of thy face ! '

"And I would wander far in forest reaches,

Where wild-wood vines entangle woodland ways,



To find the pulpit whence the brown .lack preaches
His silent sermons through the summer days.

"And I would seek the crimson cup-moss, growing
In shadow'd nook.s, and by the brooklet's brink
The fronded fern, the scarlet lily glownig

In sunny jilaces, and the wild clove-pink;
And I would gather sprays of woodbine climbing

And bearded grasses from the fields and fells,
List'uing the while, if I might catch the chiming
' Of wild bluebells.

"From sunlit heights, from billowy .seas of meadow.
From ferny hollows and from giassy braes.
The blossoms of the sunshine and the shadow.

With all the grace of nature's wild sweet ways,
I'd glean and paint on tablet, j)anel, portal,
To render them immortal.

"And they who never see the summer's glory.
The treasures of the woodland and the stream,
Should learn from me to read the wondrous story.

Sweeter by far than poet's sweetest dream
(And, reading, cease to count the weary hours) —
God's gift of flowers!"



"Rock of Ages" and "Dandelions" have
been most widely quoted, and appeal most
strongly to the popular ear, yet they are by
no means her best.

The poems are chiefly of the lyrical order,
interspersed with ballads, metrical transla-
tions of odes of Horace, and some exquisite
sonnets. Occasionally she tries her hand at
.some historical incident, throwing it, as a
study, into poetic measures. An illustration
of this is "The Death of Charles the Ninth."
This was written for her brother, tJien a stu-
dent at Bowdoin College, to be used as a reci-
tation in a competition for a prize.

If dramatic poetry be that in which the ob-
jects contemplated, animate or inanimate,
are presented as speaking for them.selves,
then several of her ]X)ems are of this class,
.such as "Immortality," "Useless," "The' Pop-
lar," and others. In fact, her compass is wide,
for she has produced some humorous poetry
as well, of a high order, that has never foimd
its way into print.

But to those who know her best her pub-
lished works fail to adequately represent her.
They seem but a fragment of what, had her
health been uniform, she would probably have
produced. For years she suffered from a



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



397



complication of nervous maladies, and doubt-
less "learned in suffering what she taught in
song."

Her endowments are found in alliance with
a masculine understanding and finely adjusted
ethical and religious &lt;iualities. She is a mem-
ber of the l^aptist church, and lives an active
Christian life; and one of her best rewards for
publishing a volume of poetry has been the
letters she has received acknowledging the
help and comftn-t ilerived from some of the
poems which seemed to voice the sentiment
of the sufferer. Mrs. Moore is exceedingly
interested in all (luestions of theology and
religion, ac(iuainted with the discussion of
"the higher criticism," well read in science
and philosophy, in which she thinks profoundly
and reasons acutely. Should future health
and leisure be granted her, with a disposition
to write again ior publication, I should rather
expect from her pen something in the line of
religious life and experience, or an examina-
tion of some subject m philosophy, or some
application of a new scientific fact to life and
conduct, than more in the line of poetry and
fiction. I add a sonnet from "Songs of Sun-
shine and Shadow," addressed to C. E. S.,
almost perfect in form and rich in suggestion :

"If thou, ilear one, wert far away from me,
And continents lay between, or oceans wide.
When lone I knelt to j^ray at eventide,
First on my lips would be my prayer for thee.
And all the distance would as nothing be
To swift-winged blessings that to thee would glide.
Thou hast gone from me, and the grave doth hide
Thee in a shadow wider than the wide sea;
Yet, when I kneel at morn or eve to pray,
Shall I not pray for thee? Ne'er can come
A day I do not love thee: must I say
No word of love? Thou livest, dear, somewhere.
Whv, if the dead are deaf, must we be dumb?"

ELVIRA ANNA TIBBETTS, of South
Boston, an officer in the Ladies' Aid
Association of the Soldiers' Home in
Massachusetts and for two years a
director in the Woman's Charity Club, was
born in Foxboro, Mass., May 26, 1847, daughter
of Luther Richmond and Almina Miranda
(Twitchell) Grover.



Her father was born November 10, 1825, in
Taunton, Mass., where her grandfather, Luther
Grover, settled when a young man. Luther
was the youngest son of Ainasa and Olive
(Paine) Grover. Amasa Grover was born
in 17()0. When seventeen years of age, he
enlisted from Mansfield as a soldier in the
Revolutionary army, serving until August
5, 1781. He was an early settler of Foxboro,
where he purchased a tract of unbroken land
anil established a homestead. The house is
in South Foxboro, on the old road that leads
from Taunton to Worcester, and is in a gooil
state of preservation. Amasa Grover died
in 1805. His wife, Olive Paine, was born
in 1764 antl died in 1844. They had a large
family of children.

Mrs. Tibbetts's paternal grandfather, Luther
Grover, was a well-known blacksmith, and
was successfully engaged in manufacturing
until he retired from business at the age of
seventy. He lived to be fourscore years,
and his last days were spent in Boston. He
married in Norton, Mass., Anna Williams
Caswell, a native of Taunton and daughter
of Alvin Caswell.

Luther Richmond Grover, father of Mrs.
Tibbetts, obtained his education in district
schools of Springfield, Newton Upper Falls,
and Foxboro, Mass. He was a skilled wcjrk-
man, but was obliged to give up an excellent
position on account of impaired eyesight.
For the past fifty years he has been engaged
in farming, and has conducted an extensive
and profitable business. He was married
May 27, 1846, in Dover, Mass., to Almina
Miranda Twitchell, and settled on the large
and pleasant estate in Foxboro where he
has lived for fifty-seven years.

A great-grandfather of Mrs. Tibbetts on
her mother's side was John Cheever, who
was born in Wrentham, Mass., in 1772, son
of James and Sarah (Shepard) Cheever. John
Cheever married Dolly ^^^leeler, of Marlboro,
N.H., who was a daughter of David and Re-
becca (Hoar) Wheeler. David Wheeler, her
father, was Town Clerk of Marlboro during
the Revolutionary War, and was a useful
and highly esteemed citizen, as is fully attested
by the numerous offices conferred upon him.

His name is on the Revolutionary Rolls of
New Hampshire as having enlisted in the
army. His daughter Lucy, sister of Dolly,
wa»s the mother of the late Hon. Rufus Frost,
ex-Mayor of Chelsea, Mass. David was a
son of Joseph^ and Deborah (Whitney) Wheeler
and grandson of John' and T^lizaheth (Wells)
Wheeler, who settled in Marlboro, Mass.
John' Wheeler was born in Concord, Mass.,
in 1661, son of Thonia.s^ antl Hannah (Harrod,
now spellerl Harwood) Wheeler. According
to the accounts of the Wheeler family given
in the histories of Marlboro, Mass., and Marl-
boro, N.H., Thomas^ was a son of Thomas
Wheeler, who was in Concord, Mass., in 1640,
was a Captain in King Philip's War, and
was wounded at Quaboag (now BrookfieUl),
Mass., in August, 1675, when his horse was
shot from under him. His son Thomas placed
him on a horse whose rider had been slain,
and both succeeded in escaping.

Mr. and Mrs. Luther R. Grover have two
children: Elvira Anna (Mrs. Tibbetts) ; and
Stillman Richmond Grover, a prosperous jew-
elry manufacturer in Attleboro, Mass. Stillman
R. Grover married December 25, 1873, Thedora
Ashley, of Taunton, Mass. They have one
child, Esther Elvira, born in October, 1S87,
now a student in the Attleboro High School.

Elvira A. Grover completed her education
at the Foxboro English Classical School,
a private high school in the centre of the
town. She taught school several terms in
Dighton and Wrentham. On June 11, 1873,
she was married to John Chase Tibbetts,
a native of Hamilton, Mass.

Mr. Tibbetts was born November 15, 1846.
He is a descendant of Aquila Chase, who came
from England and settled at Hampton, N.H., as
early as 1640, and a few years later removed
to Newbury, Mass. Mr. Tibbetts has been suc-
cessfully engagetl in mercantile business since
1869. He is a public-spirited citizen of South
Boston, interested in all that pertains to its
welfare. He is one of the founders of the Bos-
ton Retail Grocers' Association; is a Past Nol&gt;le
Grand of Tremont Lodge, Independent Order
of Odd Fellows, of Boston; has served as Dis-
trict Deputy of the order, and is a member of
Massachusetts Encampment, I. 0. of 0. F. He



is a member of the South Boston Citizens' A.sso-
ciation, is treasurer and a Deacon of the Phil-
lips Congregational Church on Broadway, and
is an associate member of Dahlgren Post, No.
2, Grantl Army of the Republic. It has been
said of him that "his career is one that adds
lustre to the history of South Boston."

Mrs. Tibbetts is interested in charitable
and patriotic work. She joined the Ladies'
Aid Association of the Soldiers' Home in
Massachusetts soon after it was organized.
She has served as visitor and director many
years, and often visits the home on Powder
Horn Hill in Chelsea. She has been a member
of the Helping Hand Society and also of the
Home for Aged Couples. She attends the
Philli])s Congregational Church. Mrs. Tibbetts
is one of the charter members of the Charity
Club, and served two years on its Board of
Directors. She has charter membership in
the Floral Emblem Society of Massachusetts,
and is a member of the Woman's Christian
Temperance L'nion at Upham's Corner, Dor-
chester, of which Mrs. Julia K. Dyer is president.
Mr. and Mrs. Tibbetts have had two children:
Alva Grover, born September 9, 1878, in
Foxboro; and John Richmond, born in Fox-
boro, January 7, 1882 (died when ten months
old). Alva Grover Tibbetts is a student
in the Law School of Boston I'niversity.

Mrs. Tibbetts, although deeply interested
in public work, is devoted to her home. She
enjoys the society of her friends, and a friend-
.ship once formed with her is never broken.
Her house is situated on a part of Dorchester
Heights, the historic ground where Washington
viewed the departure of the British troops
from Boston. From the tower of her house
can be .seen the ships in the harbor and many
places associated with the history of Boston.



ABBIE TRASK USHER, for four years
/\ President of the Woman's Relief Corps,

tion was married, on May 25, 1.S65, to William
Robert Usher, a shoe manufacturer, of Stone-
ham, Mass. While living in Stoneham, Mrs.
Usher was active in church and benevolent
work, thus endearing herself to the community.

In 1884 Mr. Usher removed to Milton, N.H.,
starting a shoe factory there. During a resi-
dence of several years in Milton, Mrs. Usher
was especially interested in religious work.
She attended the Baptist church, which had at
that time only a few members. The church
buikling and its furnishings were unattractive,
and the vestry where the prayer meetings were
held was "worse than the church," she said.
An old stove stood in the middle of the room.
The men were seated on old-fashioned wooden
seats on one side of the vestry, the women on
the other. There was no settled minister, and
no cordiality.

Mrs. Usher said: "I camiot stand this. If I
am to live in this town, I must have a church
home." She cjuietly became acquainted with
the people, then started a sewing-circle, and
formed other plans for creating a new interest.
By suggesting that they open their homes for
socials, and formulating methods of work that
was much needed, she awakened enthusiasm.
In a brief time there were many changes in the
management of the church, and thrtuigh her
zealous efforts a new church edifice and parson-
age were built.

In 1886 Mr. and Mrs. Usher returned to Stone-
ham, and soon after settled in Newburyport,
where they became leading citizens. Mrs.
Usher entered with enthusiasm into the relig-
ious, patriotic, anrl charitable work of that city.
She was an active member of the Baptist church,
was President of the Woman's Auxiliary to
the Young Men's Christian Association for six
years, and served as Director of the Young
Woman's Christian Association of Newbury-
port. She attended State conventions as a
delegate to societies connected with the Bap-
tist denomination, and had an extensive ac-
quaintance among its leaders throughout the
State. Her hospitable home was always open
to welcome clergymen and delegations from
other places whenever they visited Newbury-
port to conduct special religious work.

Mrs. Usher's brother, Jolm Augustus Bowd-



lear, was in the Thirty-second Regiment, Massa-
chusetts Volunteers, during the Civil War;
and her first work for the soldiers was in the
early days of that conflict, when, as a school-
girl, she heli)ed to scrape lint for use in the hos-
pitals. Loyal to the Union and all the prin-
ciples it represents, she never cea.sed her efforts
for the "boys in blue." There was a revival
of interest in A. W. Bartlett Relief Corps during
her presidency, and she initiated over fifty
members. Public meetings were held, also
union gatherings with the post — socials and
conferences that advanced the beneficent work
of both organizations.

Serving as a delegate to the annual conven-
tion of the Department of Massachusetts,
W. R. C, in 1886, she became interested in
its work throughout the State. Her efficiency
and devotion were cjuickly recognized, and she
received appointment on important conunittees
representing the State work. The duties of
Department Aide, of Assistant Inspector, ami
of Installing Officer were performed by her with
credit. For seventeen years she was an active
worker for the State organization and a promi-
nent participant in its annual conventions.
Mrs. Usher was elected for two successive years
as Department Chaplain of the Woman's Re-
lief Corps of Massachusetts, and her reports
containetl suggestions and recommendations of
value.

She was deeply interested in the work of
patriotic instruction, and at the annual conven-
tion in 1901, held in Boston, was appointed to
the office of Department Patriotic Instructor.
A complete report of the work accomplished
was given at the convention in 1902, and cov-
ered twenty-four printed pages. Among the
statistics it contained arc the following: —

Number of corps in Department 172

Number of school-rooms in Department hav-
ing a flag 4,255

Number of school-rooms in Department giving

flag salute 5,117

Number of .school-rooms in Department dis-
playing Declaration of Independence . . 262

Number of towns or cities in Dejjartment

holding patriotic contests 28

Mrs. Usher in her report stated that she had
received many letters showing great interest



400



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



in the work of patriotic instruction, and that
in responding to inquiries and in furnishing
desired information she had written nearly two
hundred letters and postals.

She recommended that all corps make a
special effort to interest the superintendent,
school hoard, and teachers, assuring them, when
indifferent, that this is a national movement
and that united action is earnestly desired.

In a circular issued to the corps for their
guidance, she requested every president to co-
operate with the assistant patriotic instructor
of her corps in preparing for a patriotic exer-
cise or entertainment, that their respective
comimmities may realize their ambition to
spread the lessons of patriotism among the
children. She urged them to encourage the
children to quietly salute the flag wherever
they might see it.

"One of the best plans of creating an in-
terest," she said, "is a public gathering, with
the presence of the clergy and some of the prom-
inent citizens as speakers. This should be
arranged with a view of presenting the cause
in a manner that will appeal to the hearts
and minds of the people, and especially to
those having the management of the public
schools.

"Citizens' Sunday is another method of
securing wides]iread interest in this move-
ment. Invite a clergyman to preach a sermon
devoted to this matter, or, if deemed more
effective, arrange for a union service in one
of the churches, with addresses by several
clergymen.

" As the press is an important factor in
moulding public opinion, secure, whenever
possible, the .support of the editors of your
local papers, for their influence will be invalu-
able.

"Socials, festivals, entertainments, union
meetings, the observance of historical anniver-
saries, and so forth, are among the niany ways
of promoting the success of this movement.
The Patriotic Primer for the teacher, the Decla-
ration of Independence Chart, and the Oleo-
graph of the History ami Origin of the Stars
and Stripes have been endorsed by the National
Woman's Relief Corps. The presentation to
schools of flags, historic pictures, and books.



and any gift in keeping with the spirit upon
which the Grand Army of the Republic and its
auxiliary were founded, will exert an influence
in the right direction."

Mrs. Usher visited many corps and public
meetings in behalf of this branch of the cause,
speaking entertainingly and with earnestness.
Several hundred letters containing advice and
helpful instructions were written by her each
year. As a delegate from the Department of
Massachusetts, she attended .'several National
Conventions of the W. R. C, anrl was a mem-
ber of national committees, also an aide on the
staff of the National President. In all these
varietl duties she retained her active interest in
the local corps, and rendered invaluable aid as
chairman of its Executive Connnittee.

Mrs. I'sher was the second Worthy Matron
of Beulah Chapter, 0. E. S., of Stoneham, and
was a member of the Order of Odd Ladies in
Boston. She was prominent in social circles
in Newburyport and a leader among women in
many of the progressive enterprises of the city.
She was largely instrumental in securing a sol-
diers' monument in Newburyport, being the
only woman member on the committee there-
for, and she had charge of the exercises at the
unveiling of the monument, July 4, 1902. She
was a zealous worker in the interests of the
Soldiers' Hf)me in Chelsea.

While on a visit to Texas with her husband,
Mrs. Usher' was very helpful in giving instruc-
tion to the local corps. For several years her
health had been impaired. She received an
injury while in Texas, from the effects of which
she died in Newburyport, May 31, 1903. Thus
jmssed one who was beloved by all who knew
her.

Mrs. Usher had one son, William Ambrose
I'sher. Born in Stoneham, Mass., December
14, 1866, he received his education in the pub-
lic schools of Stoneham, and is now in the
shoe manufacturing business with his father.
On April 18, 1886, he marrietl Gertrude Lougee
Brown, of Boston. They have two children:
Helen Gertrude, born December 22, 1888; and
Abbie Marion, born July 14, 1895. At the sum-
mer home of the Usher family at Salisbury
Beach numerous friends have been hospitably
entertained.




JULIA WARD HOWE



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



401



JULIA WARD HOWE, LL.D.— Wise-
hearted men and women, not a few, in
the half-century now closing, have given
earnest thought to the solving of social
problems, have wrought for love's sake and
truth's in various fields of helpful endeavor.
Eminent among them may be named the author
of the " Battle Hynm of the Republic. ' ' She was
born in New York City, May 27, LS19, daughter
of Samuel and Julia Rush (Cutler) Ward.
. It is not unreasonable to suppose that Mrs.
Howe's dominant characteristics, her broad
philanthropy, her love of study, aptitude for
language, predilection for metaphysics, her
fervid patriotism, deep religiousness, and strong
sense of justice, are derived, in part at least,
from some of the colonial worthies, her ancestors,
mentioned below.

Samuel Ward, third, father of Mrs. Howe,
was son of Lieutenant Colonel Samuel and Phebe
(Greene) Ward and grandson of Governor
Samuel Ward, of Rhode Island, Governor
Samuel l)eing the son of Governor Richard,
who was a grandson of John ^\'ar(l, of Gloucester,
Englaml, and Newport, R.I., saiil to have been
an officer in Cromwell's army. Richard Ward
married Mary, daughter of John and Isabel
(Sayles) Tillinghast. Her father was son of
Elder Pardon Tillinghast, who came from Eng-
land when a young man, and during the greater
part of a life of more than ninety years, closing
in 17IS, was a citizen of influence in the civil
and religious affairs of Providence, R.I., where
he was a merchant and for many years the un-
salaried pastor of the First Baptist Society, to
which in 1711 he gave a meeting-house. Mary
Tillinghast's mother was a daughter of John
and Mary (Williams) Sayles and grand-daugh-
ter of Roger Williams. Of this pioneer of
religious tolerance in New I^ngland, Mrs. Howe
is thus shown to be a descendant of the eighth
generation.

Samuel Ward, first, son of Richard and Mary,
l&gt;orn in Newport in 1725, served three tertns
as Governor of Rhode Island. He died in Phila-
delphia in March, 1776, during the session of
the Continental Congress, of which he was a
valued member — in the words of John Adams,
"a steatlfast friend to his country upon very
pure principles."



He married Anne Ray, daughter of Simon
Ray, third, and his wife Deborah, daughter of
Job and Phebe (Sayles) Greene. Phebe and
Isabel Sayles, named above, were sisters. Simon
Ray, third, was the son of Simon, second, and
grandson of Simon, first, of Braintree. Simon
Ray, second, was one of the sixteen original
proprietors of Block Island. Influential and
honored, a "lovely example of Christian virtues,"
he lived to enter his one hundred and second
year. He married Mary Thomas, daughter of
Nathaniel and grand-daughter of "William
Thomas, a Welsh gentleman," who joined the
Plymouth Colony about 1630, served three
years as Assistant Governor, and died at his
home at Green Harbor, Marshfield, in 1651. " A
well-approved and well-grounded Christian,"
wrote Secretary Morton, "one that had a sin-
cere desire to promote the common good, both
of church and State."

Samuel Ward, second, born in Westerly,
R.I., in 1756, a college graduate at fifteen, served
nearly six years in the Continental army, rising
from the rank of Captain to Lieutenant Colonel ;
was in Arnold's expedition to Canada and taken
prisoner at Quebec; later was with Washington
at Valley Forge, and after the war was engaged
in mercantile business in New York City. He
married his cousin Phebe, daughter of Governor
William and Catherine (Ray) Greene. Her
mother is i-emembereil as a youthful friend and
correspondent of Franklin.

Mrs. Julia R. Cutler Ward, Mrs. Howe's
mother, was a daughter of Benjamin C. Cutler, of
Boston and Jamaica Plain, sometime Sheriff of
Norfolk C-ounty, and his wife Sarah, daughter
of Thomas and Hester (Marion) Mitchell, of
Waccamaw plantation and Georgetown, S.C.
Mrs. Cutler's mother was a sister of General
Francis Marion, the "Swamp Fox" of the Revo-
lution, and granil-ilaughter of Benjamin Marion,
a Huguenot, who settled at CliJarleston, S.C,
a little over two hundred years ago.

Mrs. Howe's grandfather Cutler was son of
John Cutler, third, brass-founder, a well-to-do
citizen of Boston in his day and a prominent
Mason, being Cirand Master of the Grand Lodge
of Massachusetts, 1792-93. David Cutler, father
of John, third, was the youngest son of Johannes
Demesmaker, physician and surgeon, who came



402



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



from Holland, lived for some years at Hinghain,
married Mary Cowell, of Boston, and, adopting
the English translation of his name, was known
as Dr. John Cutler. He served as surgeon in
King Philip's War. About 1694 he removed
to Bo.st()n, where he acquired a large practice,
to which his eldest son, Dr. John Cutler, Jr.,
succeeded. John Cutler, third, in his old age
played the organ at Trinity Church, of which
his son-in-law, Samuel Parker, afterwartl Bishop
Parker, was rector. His wife, Mary Clark, was
daughter of Benjamin and Miriam (Kilby) Clark
and grand-daughter of Christopher Kilby, Sr.,
of Boston.

Mrs. Howe's father, a successful banker, a
man of sterling integrity and of almost Puri-
tanic strictness of life, was liberal in his plans
and provision for the education of his children.
There were three sons — Samuel, Henry, and
F. Marion — and three daughters — Julia, Louisa,
and Annie. Two sons ilied unmarried. The
eldest, Sanuiel Ward, fourth, died in 1884, sur-
vived by the children of his daughter Margaret
(Mrs. J. W. Chanler), whose mother, his first
wife, was a daughter of William B. Astor.
Louisa Ward married, first, Thomas Crawford,
the sculptor, and after his death married Luther
Terry, an artist. Her home was in Rome, Italy.
She was the mother of F. Marion Crawford.
Annie Ward married Mr. Adolph Mailliard, and
lived in California.

Pursuing her studies at home under able in-
structors, .Julia Ward became well versed in
music and several languages, in after years
taking up German philosophy and the study
of (ireek, which she still continvies. She was
married in April, 1843, to Dr. Samuel Cridley
Howe, of Boston, world-famous philanthropist
and teacher, in his early Tnanhood one of the
heroes of the Greek revolution, of which he
subsecjuently wrote an historical sketch. .AftcT
a year or more spent abroad and the birth of
a daughter, Julia Romana, in Rome, Dr. and
Mrs. Howe took up their residence in lioston,
he to continue his beneficent activities as
superintendent of the School for the Blind
(1832-76), head of the School for Feeble-
minded (1848-75), as member of the State
Boartl of Education, and president of the Board
of Charities — to mention only a few of the



many lines on which he worked to the end of his
days — she in the meantime not to remain idle.

Five children were born to them in Boston.
The four now living are: Florence Marion,

Romana, poet and stutlent, who died in March,
1886, was the wife of Michael Anagnos, a native
of Greece, Dr. Howe's successor as director of
the School for the Blind at South Boston.

Mrs. Howe has written much both in prose
and verse. She has been a contributor to the
New York Tribune; the Independent; the
Atlantic Monthly, in which the " Battle Hymn,"
written in ^^'ashington after beholding the camp-
fires by night, first apjjeared in j)rint (February,
1862); the North American Rericiv; and other
periodicals. Among her books may be named
"Passion Flowers," i.ssued anonymously in
1854; "Later Lyrics," 1866; "From the Oak
to the Olive," 1867; "Is Polite Society Polite?
and Other l&lt;]ssays," 1895; "From Sunset Ridge,"
1898; and " I;Jeminiscences," 1899', covering
fourscore years of exceptionally rich and varied
experiences.

Mrs. Howe's connection with the woman
suffrage movement began in 1868. Her fii'st
speech in its advocacy before a legislative
committee was made in the Green Room of
the State House in 1869. She has been officially
connected from the start with the New I'^ngland
and other woman suffrage organizations, in
which she has taken an active pait. For some
time she was an associate editor of the Woman's
Journal. As l(&gt;cturer and preacher the greater
number of her journeyings have been made since
the death of Dr. Howe, in January, 1876. In
her lectures she has given interesting recollec-
tions with appreciative judgments of Longfellow
and l']merson and \\'hittier, has spoJ&lt;en symjia-
thetically of " Patriotism in Lit(&gt;rature," has
offered a "Plea for Humor," and has treated a
variety of other subjects with characteristic
grace and vigor.

Music, for which Mrs. Howe has a cultivated
taste, is her favorite recreation. She has com-
posed a number of songs, some of which are
well known among her friends, although un-
published. A Unitarian in religion, she is a
member of the Church of the Disciples, Boston.
For many years she has been the honored ami
beloved president of the New England \\omen's
Club and of the Association for the Advance-
ment of Women. She is Regent of Liberty
Tree Chapter, Daughters of the American Revo-
lution, and an honorary member of the Society
of Colonial Dames in the State of Rhode
Island.

To this reprint of sketch publisheil in 1901
may be atlded that Mrs. Howe has recently
passed her eighty-fifth anniversary, antl, im-
proving the opportunity of age, is still active
with voice and pen in behalf of many good
causes. From Tufts College, at its recent
Commencement, June 15, 1904, she received
the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.

ELIZABETH PALMER PEABODY, edu-
cator and author, was born in Billerica,
Mass., May 16, 1804, daughter of Dr.
Nathaniel Peabotly and his wife, Eliza-
beth Palmer. She was the eldest of three nota-
ble sisters, of whom in her latest years she was
the sole survivor. The one nearest her in age
was Mary Tyler, b(jrn in Cambridge in 1806,
who married Horace Mann; and the other was
Sophia Amelia, who became the wife of Nathan-
iel Hawthorne.

The father, Nathaniel Peabody, a lineal de-
scendant of Francis Peabody, of Topsfield, the
immigrant progenitor of the family of this
name in New England, was graduated at Dart-
mouth College in 1800. For some years, later
in life, he practised dentistry in Salem and Bos-
ton. He married in 1802 Elizabeth Palmer,
who had been preceptress of the girls' depart-
ment of an incorporated school in North An-
( lover, Mass., of which he was the principal, the
school in 180.'^ being named l&lt;&gt;anklin Academy.
A "lady of rare gifts and attainments," Miss
Palmer was a successful teacher, winning the
respect and affection of her i)upils and inciting



in them a love of learning. She was the daugh-
ter of Joseph Pearse and Elizabeth (Hunt)
Palmer and grand-daughter of General Joseph
Palmer of 'Revolutionary times, who with his
wife Mary, sister of Judge Richard Cranch, came
to Boston from Devonshire, England, in 1746.
Her maternal grandfather was John Hunt, of
Watertown (Harvard College, 1734), whose son,
Samuel Hunt, her uncle, was for about thirty
years master of the Boston Latin School.

Joseph Pearse Palmer (Harvard College,
1771) was one of the Boston Tea Party in De-
cember, 1773, and he also served his country in
the Revolution. Some years after the close of
the war he removed to Framingham, where he
taught school. He diet! in Vermont in 1797,
seven years before the birth of the grand-
daughter whose name heads the present sketch.
After his death his wife and chiklren resided in
Watertown.

Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, descended from
this worthy, patriotic, and scholarly ancestry,
was a precocious child, early displaying un-
usual mental abilities and a fondness for stutly.
At the age of sixteen she began to teach school
in Lancaster. She subsequently taught succes-
sively in Hallowell, Me., in Brookline, Mass.,
with her sister Mary, and in Boston. She was
acquainted with a number of languages, an-
cient and modern, learning Polish when she
was well advanced in years; and she excelled
as a teacher of history, in which she had classes.

In September, 1834, Mr. A. Bronson Alcott
opened hi.s* school at the Masonic Temple, Bos-
ton. His diary thus mentions his assistant:
" Mi.ss Peabyody, whose reputation both as re-
gards original and acquired ability is high:
she unir^s intellectual and practical qualities
of no ccnunon order."

Miss Peabody's great work, begun after she
was fifty years old, was as an interpreter of
Froebel's system of education and introducer
of the kindergarten into this country.

For about ten years (1840-50) she kept at
the family home, 13 West Street, Boston, a
shop for the sale of foreign books and journals,
and a circulating library, the place becoming
for the time a "centre of the finest intellectual
culture." Here were held some of Margaret
Fuller's conversations.

Miss Peabody was a contributor to the Chris-
tian Examiner, the Dial, Barnard's Journal nj
Education, and otlier periocHcals. Among her
books were (not to make an exhau?;tive Hst of
the works of her pen): "Moral Self-echication,"
translated from the French, 1S28; "First Steps
in History"; "Key to Hebrew History"; also
"Keys to Grecian and to Roman History,"
1833; "Record of a School" (Mr. Alcott's),
1835 (third edition, revised, 1874); with Mrs.
Mann, "Moral Culture of Infancy" and "Kin-
dergarten Guide," of which after her visit to
Europe she issued early in the seventies a re-
vised edition; "Reminiscences of William E.
Channuig, D.D."; and "A Last Evening with
Allston."

Mrs. Mann, besides being a writer on educa-
tional topics and a translator, was the author
of "A Physiological Cook-book," "Flower Peo-
ple," "Life of Horace Mann," and "Juanita, a
Romance of Real Life in Cuba."

Toward the close of her life Elizabeth Pea-
body became blind. She died in Jamaica Plain,
January 3, 1894, in her ninetieth year.

On May 2, 1904, two weeks before the one
hundredth anniversary of her birth, at a meet-
ing of the New England \A'omen's Club, of
which she had been a valuetl member, heart-
felt tribute in the form of letters and addresses
of some length was paid to her memory by Mrs.
Howe, president of the club, Mrs. Cheney,
Colonel Higginson, Dr. Hale, and others who
had known her long and well.

Mrs. Howe, after speaking of her as one who
"recognized everywhere the beauty and glory
of existence," said: "I cannot remember evei'
to have known any one who carried throi\gh
life so much of this serene atmosphere, the re-
sult of high aspirations, genuine culture, and
sweet humanity. Her nature was very ex-
pansive and her life full of benevolcMit activity.
. . . She helped Margaret Fuller to arrange her
first conversations in Boston. Slie espoused
the cause of the Pole, the Hungarian, the Ind-
ian. She was the devoted frientl of Kossuth's
sister. Whom has she not befriended when
they most needed a friend? Her declining
years were followed with love and gratitude."

Mrs. Cheney alluded to the fact that in her
old age [*;iizabeth Palmer Pealxxly was often



spoken of as "the grandmother of Boston,"
and added: "She was rightly named if the con-
stant outflow of her warm heart to every one
with all manner of loving feelings and helpful
deeds and the best of all instructions to the
children of every age in the city of her love
could entitle her to this distinction. . . . Her
large and varied reading filled her mind with
stores of history, poetry, and philosophy. She
gathered special advantage from the hobbies
into which she entered with all her heart for
the time. Out of them she gained always
something rich and rare.

"She certainly had not the reputation of
being a practical person. She was too readily
interested in every scheme that offered good
to the human race, too credulous of any intli-
vidual who sought her help or comfort. In try-
ing times her un.selfish help, her advice, hei'
sympathy, were all fruitful of good results
which had seemed hopeless to less believing
and ardent natures.

"Goethe says, 'All philosophy must be lived
and loved.' Such was the spirit in which
I'ilizabeth P. Peabody spent her ninety years
in constant service to mankind."

ADh:LINE D. T. WHITNEY, one of the
/ \ successful women writers of New I'&gt;ng-
X .^ land in the latter half of the nine-
t(&gt;entli century and still an active
member of the craft in the first decade of the
twentieth, is a Bostonian by l)irth and breed-
ing. Her maiden name was Adeline Dutton
Train. After her marriage in November, 1843,
to Seth I). Whitney, of Milton, Mass., she be-
came a resident of that town, where in her
widowhood she contimies to make her home,
Mr. Uhitney having died in 1890.

Born September 15, 1824, the daughter of
Enoch Train and his first wife, Adeline
Dutton, Mrs. \\'hitney is a grand-daughter
on the paternal side of Knoch, Sr., and Hannah
(Elwing) Train and a descendant in the seventh
generation of John' Train(\ who came to Massa-
chusetts in 1635 and settled at Watertown.
Mrs. Whitney's granrlmother Train was the
daughter of the Rev. Dr. Ewing, of Pliila(leli)hia,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



405



who had been a chaphiiu in the British army.
Mrs. Whitney's father, Enoch Train the younger,
was a pioneer merchant and ship-owner of
Boston in liis ihiy. Hei- maternal grandparents,
Silas Button and Nancy Tobey, who were mar-
ried in Boston on July 17, ISOO, belonged to
old New England families.

For four years in her early teens Mrs. A\'hit-
ney was a student in the excellent private
school for girls kept in Boston from 1823 to
1855 by George B. Emerson, one of the best of
teachers New Paigland has ever produced, ami
for one year she was at Northampton in the
noted school of Miss Margarette Dwight, who
was very thorougli, systematic, and successful
in her vocation.

The first in the long list of jHiblications wliich
have given Mrs. Whitney her enviable position
among .\merican authors, and won for her a
host of admiring readers, was "Mother Goose
for Grown Folks," issued by Rudd &amp; Carleton
in 1859. Then came "Boys of Chequasset,"
"Faith Gartney's Girlhood," and "The Gay-
worthys," published by Loring. "A Sunmier
in Leslie Goldthwaite's Life" first appeared
as a serial in Our Young Folkfi in 1866; "Pa-
tience Strong's Outings" in tlie Chrii^iian
Rec/ister, 1868-70. Among her books of later
(late may be mentioned "We Girls," "Real
Folks," "Sights and Insights," " Bonnybor-
ough," "A.scutney Street," four volumes of
poems, one of them entitled "Pansies," and
five miscellaneous volumes, one being "Just
How, a Key to the Cook-book." "Squai-e
Pegs, a Novel," came out in the autunm of 1894,
marking the completion of her seventieth year,
and was well receivetl, being a worthy successor
of the foregoing, not one of the ephemera,
but a l)ook to be read ami reread.

It was of Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney that Harriet
Beecher Stowe wrote some twenty or more
years ago : " We have in New England a lady
writer who for our times and seasons has done
very nmch the work for young people that Mi.ss
Edgeworth ilid in hers; while her writings are
spicy and amusing, they have a decided in-
fluence upon the character, an influence any
parent might be thankful for. . . . She excels
in painting simple, lovely, perfect homes and
nice, gentle, natural young people. . . . The



religious teachings of her books have no cant
phraseology, but they show how the spirit of
Christ may be brought into actual life."

In the words of another thoughtful critic:
"Mrs. Whitney is a sworn foe to sentimental-
ism. She hates fine language, fine speeches,
hue professions of virtue and piety and friend-
ship. Her characters, if her favorites, are
seldom afflicted with long tongues. . . . She has
read nmch ami knows nmch, ami shows inci-
dentally and without pedantry her botany
and geology antl astronomy, and that she keeps
up with the science and philosophy of the day,
and is familiar with the best authors. . . . But,
after all, we return to her genius for religion and
for teaching religion by fictitious characters,
characters working out their own salvation
umler ordinary human and New England cir-
cumstances, as the cardinal glory antl charm
of these books."

Mrs. Whitney has had four children — three
(laughters and a son, Theodore T. One daugh-
ter died in infancy. The eldest married in
1867 Major (now Colonel) Suter, of the United
States army, and died in the same year. The-
odore Train Whitney occupies the old Whitney
homestead in Milton, his mother living in a
little hou.se that she built for herself a few years
since in his grounds. Mr. Whitney has a son,
Theodore T., Jr., and three daughters.

Mrs. Whitney's youngest daughter, Caroline
Leslie, married James A. Field, of Beloit, Wis.
At the time of his death, in 1884, their home
was in Lakewood, N.J. Mrs. Field was the
author of "High Lights," a novel, and of
"Nannie's Happy Childhood," an attractive
book for girls. She died December 1, 1902,
leaving three sons. The eldest son, William
L. W., is instructor of natural science in Milton
Academy and at the summer school in Alstead,
N.H. The .second, James A., is a teacher at
Harvard L^niversity, where he was graduated
with honors in 1903. The third, Douglas
Grahame, is still a Harvard student, as is his
cousin Theodore, above named. Mrs. Whitney
has also a great-grandchild, the son of ^^'iIliam
L. W. Field, who was married in 1902.

Mrs. Whitney, it is pleasant to record in
closing, expresses herself as being very happy,
in these latter days of her eightieth year, in



406

having all these young people so near about
her and so much with her in her home.

A LICE STONE BLACK WELL was born
/\ in Orange, N. J., September 14,. 1S57,
L \. the daughter of Henry B. Blackwell
and his wife, Lucy Stone. In 1869
her parents moved to Massachusetts. She was
fitted for college at Chauncy Hall School in
Boston, where sh(! took the Thayer prize for
English composition and a special prize for
knowledge of Shakespe'are. .She graduated
from the Collegeof Liberal Arts of Boston Uni-
versity with honors in 1881, and began in the
same year to helj) her parents edit the Woman' si
Journal. For the last sixteen years she has
also edited a small fortnightly paper called the
Woman's Column, devoted to e(]ual suffrage.
She was largely instrumental in persuading the
two branches of the Woman's Suffrage Associa-
tion, which had split twenty years before, to
reunite in 1889; and she has since been record-
ing secretary of the united society, the National
American Woman Suffrage Association. She
is also chairman of the Executive Committee
of the New England Woman Suffrage Asso-
ciation and chairman of the Literature Com-
mittee of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage
Association. She has been much interested
in the Armenian question, has for many years
been in the habit of befriending Armenian im-
migrants, and is the author of "Armenian
Poems," a small volume of verse translatetl
from the Armenian. She is also the cotnpiler,
with the Rev. Anna H. Shaw and Miss Lucy E.
Anthony, of a book of equal rights recitations,
"The Yellow Ribbon Speaker." She was for
some years Associate National Superintendent
of Franchise for the W. C. T. U. She lectures
occasionally, and is interested in a number of
reforms.

Miss Blackwell inherits much of her mother's
tenacity and singleness of purpose. Endowed
with a ready wit and retentive memoiy, in
legislative hearings for and against suffrage
she retains a vivid recollection of all that is
said in opposition, and is usually able to turn
the weapons of her antagonists against them-



selves. Among the younger advocates of suf-
frage she is distinguished for her valuable and
acceptable service.



ADELINE FRANCES FITZ.— In the list
/ \ of Boston's women composers who
X ^ occui)y a high jiosition is found the
name of Adehne Frances Fitz, without
any self-seeking on her part, her work winning
its way l)y jjure merit. Her compositions
were first brought out in Boston after being
proiluced as a pastime. Her scope is almost
illimitable, comprising songs for kindergarten,
hynm settings, piano solos, songs for concert
use, and a vast number of patriotic songs.
Mrs. Fitz has been an ardent worker for the
cause of patriotism.- She has .served the
Daughters of the Revolution, C'onunonwealth
of Massachusetts, three years as State Historian
and two years as Vice-Regent; and on March
17 last she accepted the position of State Regent,
Daughters of the Revolution. At the annual
convention of the Gf'neral Society in May she
was elected first Vice-President-general. Mrs.
Fitz places music first in her artistic likings,
but has a discriminating taste in literature,
as is shown by her choice of words set to nmsic,
as well as in her musical sketches which she is
often called upon to deliver before clubs.

Through Mrs. Fitz's untiring energy and the
hearty co-operation of her fellow-members, the
Daughters of the Revolution, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, placed in the Boston Public
Library a memorial tablet to the pre-eminent
writers of American patriotic verse and song.
This tablet was unveiled in the Lecture Hall on
Tuesday evening, May 3, 1904, fully seven
hundred people witnessing the ceremony, which
was most impressive. The presentation speech,
choicely worded, was made by Mrs. Fitz. The
Rev. Dr. De Normandie responded in behalf
of the Public Library Trustees. (For further
account of the memorial see article on " Daugh-
ters of the Revolution, Conunon wealth of
Massachusetts.")

Mrs. Fitz was born in ('helsea, and is the
(laughter of David and Elizabeth Wilson
(Whitaker) Slade. She was married in 1S84
to the Hon. Frank E. Fitz, of Chelsea. The

first part of her married life was spent in Boston.
At present the family make their home during
the winter season with Mrs. Fitz's father,
David Slade, of Chelsea. Th(&gt;y have an attrac-
tive summer residence at Wakefield, Mass.
Three sturdy boys furnisli inspiration for the
mother's best effort.

Mr. David Slade's paternal grandfather,
John Slade, the founder of this branch of the
Slade family in New England, camp from Devon-
shire in the latter part of th(&gt; eighteenth
century. On the 4th of August, 1776, he,
"John Slade of Boston," married "Hannah
Torrey of Scituate." The Probate Records of
Suffolk County show that on the lltk Octoljer,
1791, Hannah Slade, widow, w:is appointed
"administratrix of the estate of John Slade, late
of Chelsea, deceased." It is said that at some
period of his residence in Massachusetts John
Slade owned a number of slaves.

Through Mrs. Hannah Torrey Slade," Jier
great-grandmother, Mrs. Fitz is descended from
Lieutenant James Torrey, who was an inhabitant
of Scituate before 1640; ami through her paternal
grandmother, Sally Danforth, wife of Henry
Slade, Mrs. Fitz is a descendant in the ninth
generation of Nicholas Danforth, the innnigrant
progenitor of the Middlesex County colonial
family of this name. Nicholas Danforth came
to New England in 1634. The records of Cam-
bridge, Mass., show that he became a land-
owner in 1635, was a Deputy, or Representative,
to General Court in the same year, and on the
20th of November, 1637, was one of the impor-
tant conunittee selected " to take orders for
college at Newtown" (Cambridge). He died
in April, 1638. The line of descent to Mrs.
Sally Danforth Slade, who was of the seventh
generation, was through his third and youngest
son. Captain Jonathan Danforth, an early
settler of Billerica, Mass.

Joshua Danforth, father of Sally and great-
grandfather of Mrs. Fitz, was a Revolutionary
soldier and in his old age a United States
pensioner.

Mrs. Fitz's mother was a native of England,
coming to this country when but a few months
old. She was a loyal American, and taught
her children to love her adopted country. It
is not strange, with these records, that Mrs.



Fitz stantls to-day as a representative New
England woman.



SARAH JOSEPHA HALE, author and
])hilanthropist, was born October 24,
17.SS, in Newport, N.H. She was a
daughter of Captain Gordon ami Martha
(Whittlesey) Buell and grand-daughter of
Nathan and Tliankful (Grifhn) Buell and of
Joseph and Sarah (Whittlesey) Whittlesley, all
descendants of New England Pui'itans, early
settlers of Coimecticut.

Ca|)tain Gordon Bu(&gt;ll served as an officer in
the Revolution, and after the war he settled
in Newport, N.H.

When only sixteen years old, Sarah J. Buell
began teaching school, which jjrofession she
followed for nine years. In 1813 she married
David Hale, a lawyer, of Newport, and in 1822
by his death she was left a wiilow with five
children.

Mrs. Hale had already Ijecome a worker with
her pen, contributing to various newspapers
and other periodicals. In 1823 she publisheil
a collection of her verses, entitletl "The Genius
of Oblivion, and Other Poems." Her first
novel, "Northwood," was issued in Boston in
1827, under the title of "The Book of Flowers."

In 1828 Mrs. Hale n^moved from her home
among the hills to Boston, to take the position
of etlitor of the Ladies' Magazine, the first pub-
lication of its kind for women in America. In
1837 the Magazine was merged into Godey's
Lady's Book of Philadelphia, Mrs. Hale becom-
ing its literary e&lt;litor and serving in that capac-
ity till her retirement in 1877.

Among the publications of Mrs. Hale were
"Sketches of Americm Character," "Traits of
American Life," "Flori's Interpreter" (also
publisheil in London), "The Way to Live Well
and to be Well while we Live," "Grosvenor, a
Tragedy," and a Dictionary of Poetical Quota-
tions. Her most important work, safe to say
that by which she will be longest rememberecl,
was "The Woman's Record," originally jnib-
lishetl in 1852 (other editions ap]jearing later),
an octavo volume of nine hundred pages, con-
taining biograjihical sketches of more than two
thousand distinguished women. Of this book



408



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



she said, " I have sought to make it an assistant
in home education, hoping the examples shown
and characters portrayed might have an inspi-
ration and power in advancing the moral prog-
gress of society." The account of herself in its
pages is in part as follows: —

"I was mainly educated by my mother and
strictly taught to make the Bible the guide of
my life. The books to which I had access were
few, very few in comparison to the number
given children nowadays; but they were such
as required to be studied, and I did study
them. Next to the Bible and the 'Pilgrim's
Progress' my earliest reading was Milton, Ad-
dison, Pope, Johnson, Cowper, Burns, and a
portion of Shakespeare. I did not obtain ail
his works until I was nearly fifteen. The first
regular novel I read was 'The Mysteries of
lUlolpho,' when I was ([uite a child. I name
it on account of the inHuenco it exerted over
my mind.

"I had remarked that, of all the works I
saw, few were written by Americans and none
by women. Here was a work the most fasci-
nating I had ever read, always excepting ' Pil-
grim's Progress,' written by a woman. How
happy it made me! The wish to promote the
reputation of my own sex and do something for.
my own country was among the earliest mental
emotions I can recollect. These feelings have
had a.salutary influence bydirectinginy tlioughts
to a definite object: my literary pursuits have
had an aim beyond se]f-.seeking of any kind."

A woman of original ideas and forceful will,
Mrs. Hale in her day, the middle ([uarters of
the nineteenth century, took the initiative in
various public movements of patriotic, ])hil-
anthropic, or religious nature. In Philadelphia,
whither she removed from Boston in 1841, and
where she died on April 30, 1879, she founded
the Ladies' Medical Missionary Society of that
city, and also the Seamen's Ai&lt;l Society, of
which she was the first president. She is cred-
ited with having been the first to suggest and
to advocate (which she did for twenty years)
the setting apart annually of the last Thursday
in November as a day of national thanks-
giving, President Lincoln being the first to
adopt the suggestion by d(&gt;sigiiating this date
in his national Thanksgiving proclamation.



American patriots of to-tiay may well bear
gratefully in mind the zeal and eflSciency with
which Mrs. Sarah Josepha Hale more than half
a century ago jjromoted the completion of the
granite obelisk that perpetuates the memory of
the battle of Bunker Hill. It is a page of almost
forgotten history. A few years after the laying
of the corner-stone of the monument, which
took place on June 17, 1825, the funds of the
Monument Association had all been expended,
and the shaft had risen only to the height of
forty feet. In January, 1830, as narrated in
Professor Packard's brief history of the work,
the directors received anil accepted from Mrs.
Hale a "pi-oposition to raise funds for its con-
tinuance by an appeal to the ladies of New
England." The efforts of the ladies at this
time resulted in the contribution of less than
two thousand dollars, by 18,34 amounting to
nearly three thousand dollars. Other sums
were received, and the structure grew to the
height of eighty feet. In the report of the as.so-
ciation in June, 1840, "doubt was expressed
whether the j)resent generation would witness
the completion of the monument. ... In a
sewing-circle of Boston several ladies proposed
the idea of a fair in its behalf."

Under the management of a committee con-
sisting of Mrs. Sarah J. Hale, Mrs. William H.
PresQott, and other ladies of Boston, the fail-
was held in t^uincy Hall in September, 1840,
and continueil seven days. A paper called
The Monument, edited by Mrs. Hale, was
printed daily in the fair building. The fair
was admirably conducted. The proceeds,
amounting to thirty thousand dollars, with
twenty-five thousand dollars from other sources,
afforded th(&gt; means for completing the monu-
ment.

County, Me., was the daughter of Archibald
and Betsey (Knights) Mathews.

On the death of Mr. Brown his widow re-
moved from Liberty to Augusta, Me., where
her daughter was educated. While a pupil
at the high school in that city. Miss Brown
was a classmate of Harriet and Alice, the
daughters of the Hon. James G. lilaine. Her
school-days were marked by the faithful and
diligent application that has characterized
the work of her later life, and she was grad-
uated from the high school with high honors.
Besides being noted as one of the best schol-
ars in her class, she was beloved by her teachers
and school associates for her kindly and ami-
able disjjosition.

Early in life Miss Brown received funda-
mental training in temperance work, a sphere
in which she was destined to wield a potent
influence in later years. While yet a child
she became a member of a Cold Water Temple
organized at Augusta by General Joshua Nye,
and for several terms held the office of Chief
Templar of that society. Soon after leaving
the high school she removed with her mother
to Massachusetts. Of this State they have
since remained residents, their home at the
present time (May, 1902) being in Quincy.
Here Miss Brown is connected with the parish
of the First Unitarian Church, of which the
Rev. Ellery Channing Butler is pastor.

Miss Brown's connection with the temper-
ance movement in Massachusetts may be said
to date from the fall of 1878, when she first
entered the employ of Mr. Henry H. Faxon,
the noted temperance reformer. Mr. Faxon
was then at the zenith of his power, conducting
such vigorous campaigns against the liquor
traffic and in support of morality and an up-
lifting home life as never Ix^fore had been
witnessed in the Commonwealth. About this
time Miss Brown joined the orders of the Sons
of Temperance and the Good Templars, in



which she has been honored with the highest
official positions. Her duties in Mr. Faxon's
office were at first those of an assistant clerk.
Her abilities and true worth were, however,
soon recognized by Mr. Faxon; and he pro-
moted her to the position of chief clerk. In
1884 she became Mr. Faxon's private secre-
tary, in which capacity she has since contin-
ued. The nmltifarious duties that have de-
volved upon her since assuming this office
can be realized only by Mr. Faxon and her-
self. P'rom the first she seemed to catch the
spirit of untiring zeal and unremitting energy
that Mr. Faxon had infused into his life work,
a work that would have Ineen voiil of results
but for those superabundant ciualities, together
with his unsleeping vigilance and the gener-
ous use of his money in aid of the temperance
cau.se.

The management of the Faxon Political
Temperance Bureau was publicly transferred
to Miss Brown on March 22, 1902, although
for several years previous to that date she had
been the directing spirit of Mr. Faxon's work.
During his crusade in enforcing the liquor
laws in his home city, Quincy, Mr. Faxon
bi'ought more than five huntlred cases before
the courts, the testimony in nearly all of which,
both in the upper and lower courts, was taken
by Miss Brown. This experience proved of
inestimable value to her, and has been turned
to good advantage in later years.

Nor is it alone in direct temperance work
that Mr. Faxon has found a most helpful
co-laborer in Miss Brown. In all of his great
political battles she has proved to be a most
efficient assistant. She took a prominent part
in the famous Temperance Republican Con-
vention in August, 1879, where plans were per-
fected for the nomination of the Hon. John D.
Long for the office of governor, an event to
have taken part in which she has always re-
garded as an honor; for, as she says, "John D.
Long has always been a consistent temper-
ance man. His record as a legislator and as
an office-holder are perfectly satisfactory to
the friends of the reform." Mr. Faxon very
generously shares with Miss Brown the honors
of his victory over the saloon forces in the city
of Quincy. He has always maintained that

without her assistance he could never have
achieved the grand and beneficial results that
are apparent on every hand in consequence
of the continuous and well-enforced policy of
no license that has prevailed for the past
twenty years in Quincy. For many years
Miss Brown has prepared Mr. Faxon's articles
for the press, besides editing all the circulars
and pamphlets that have been issued from his
bureau — millions of pages annually.

Probably the most notable work that Miss
Brown has compiled, and which has proved
to be of incalculable value to those whose duty
it is to enforce the liquor laws, is the book en-
titled "The Laws of Massachusetts relating
to Intoxicating Liquors." The compilation
of this work was a stupendous task and neces-
sarily a most exacting one, since the volume
was intended to be, as it is, a standard author-
ity, to which public j)rosecutors might turn
for information and advice. Li preparing it
Miss Brown was obliged to make an exhaustive
investigation of the liciuor laws passed by the
Legislature, together with the court decisions
rendered in cases of violation of those laws.
So thoroughly did she do her work that it is
safe to say there is not a law on the statute
books pertaining to the manufacture and sale
of intoxicating liquors, nor a decision on the
same, with which she is not familiar. Eleven
editions of this book have Ikhmi published by
Mr. Faxon, and to-day th(&gt; manual is in gen-
eral use in courts and municipal offices all over
the State.

In LS89 Miss Brown was the chief clerk of
the Constitutional Prohibitory Amendment
Campaign Committee (of which Colonel Ed-
ward H. Haskell, of Newton, was chairman),
having charge of the correspondence and the
assignment of the speakers. The campaign was
one of the memorable ones of the Common-
wealth, and her abihty and untiring persever-
ance were amply demonstrated in connection
wkth her part in it.

About twelve years ago Miss Brown began
her career at the State House. At first she did
not like the work, owing to the publicity it
entailed, but under the guidance of Mr. Faxon
she soon became familiar with the details of
legislative routine. The universal courtesy



shown her, and the assistance accorded bj'
the members of the General Court, are impor-
tant factors in her legislative successes; and
to-day there is not a person on Beacon Hill
whose advice in coimection with temperance
legislation is so much sought as the woman
upon whose shoulders has fallen the mantle
of the renowned Hemy H. Faxon, and no one,
it may be atlded, enjoys greater confidence.
P'or the past six years Miss Brown has been
Mr. Faxon's sole representative at the State
House, where she passes a great deal of time
during the legislative sessions, looking after
the different bills affecting the liquor question,
the Sunday laws, ami other subjects in which
Mr. Faxon has always taken a great interest.
Miss Brown enjoys the distinction of being
the only woman in New England who is reg-
istered as legislative agent and counsel. The
authority thus conferred entitles her to the
privileges of conducting hearings before the
various committees and of cross-examining wit-
nesses. In LS96 she conducted one of the most
important hearings ever held at the State House,
when the bill authorizing the payment to the
State of the entire sum received as fees from
liquor licenses was being considered.

The temperance forces all over the Connnon-
wealth owe her a debt of gratitude for the effi-
cient manner in which she has labored for the
protection of the restrictive features of the
laws regulating the sale of intoxicating licjuors.
Her able efforts which accomplished the defeat
of the "abutters'" law every year and the
famous semi-colon law are well known. Some
of the most important statutes of a prohib-
itive character that have been passed owing
chiefly to her work and influence are those
which compel the closing of the saloons on all
legal holidays, the so-called Faxon Express
Law, and several others restricting the sale
of liquor by druggists. All of these laws she
personally fonnulated and fought for until
their passage was secured.

The correspondence of the Faxon Political
Temperance Bureau, of which Miss Brown
is now the sok' manager, is almost unlimited,
and covers more phases of the reform than
that of any other temperance society. She
is in constant communication with munici-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



411



pal officers and citizens interested in the en-
forcement of the laws, and is always found
willing and ready in furnishing information
and helping to solve tlieir local problems.
It is no exaggeration to say that she has the
necessary authorities at her finger tijjs, and
her advice proves to be of inestimable value
in such cases.

In Miss Brown the temperance interests have
a careful and wide-awake guardian and the
liquor forces as uncompromising and unrelent-
ing a foe as Mr. Faxon himself ever proved to
be.

Miss Brown is one of the directors of the
Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society, serv-
ing upon all of its important committees. The
po.sition of clerk of the corporation, which she
held for many years, she resigned in 1901.

ANNIE HINCKLEY STONE LEIGH-

/\ TON (Mrs. Llewellyn Morse Leigh ton),
X JL of Portland, Me., was born at Oldtown,
August 11, 1854, the daughter of Alfred
M. and Nancy C. (Atkins) Stone. Her great-
grandfather in the maternal line, Captain
Nathaniel Atkins, of Truro, Cape Cod, Mass.,
in one of the closing years of the eighteenth
century sailed from Castine as master of the
brig "Polly," and was taken by the French.
Through this wrongful seizure Mrs. Leighton
became one of the French spoliation claim-
ants of the latter part of the nineteenth cen-
tury. Her grandfather, Nathaniel Atkins, ,Ir.,
also a seafaring man, was among the tlefenders
of the nation in the War of 1812 with Great
Britain.

Educated in the public schools and the old
academy at Corinna, Annie Hinckley Stone,
al fifteen, on account of the proficiency in her
studies shown when she appeared before the
board of examiners, was granted a certificate
to teach school. This was two years before
she attained the age prescribed by the law of
the State for the exercise of that vocation.

In 1871, at Corinth, Me., she became the
wife of Llewellyn Monse Leighton, then of
Exeter. In 1877 they removed to Portland,
where Mr. Leighton is actively engaged in the
real estate business, being specially interested



in developing the beautiful suburbs of the
city.

Mr. and Mrs. Leighton have two children:
Marshall Ora Leighton, chief of the depart-
ment of hydro-economics in the Geological
Survey, of Washington; and Florence Leigh-
ton, now Mrs. Josiah H. Johnson, of Portland.

Mrs. Leighton's marriage was an early one.
Her education, however, still went on. She
was an enthusiastic student of elocution and of
pliysical culture, which she taught after her chil-
dren were of school age. In the church, philan-
thropic, club, and social life of Portland she
is acknowledged an imj^ortant factor. The
Young Women's Chiistiaii Association of Port-
land was organized through her efforts in 1893
and incorporatetl in 1894. She was its first
president, and in the face of many discourage-
ments placed it on a basis from which it has
advanced to an assured position of usefulness.
The Chautauqua movement early received her
support. In th«! Civic Club Mrs. Leighton
is secretary of the Department of Trees and
Parks, created at her suggestion. Japheth
Club, a progre,ssive literary organization, was
founded by her.



SARAH SWEET WINDSOR, M.D., is
a native of Rhode Island, being the
daughter of Benjamin Angell antl
Sarah (Sweet) Windsor, of Smithfield,
thijt State. On the paternal side she is
descended from Joshua Windsor, who came
to this country from England at an early
date, and was one of the thirteen signers
of the civil compact adopted at the town
meeting held in Providence, August 20, 1637,
the year after the settlement was begun;
and she is also descended from Roger Williams,
the founder of Rhode Island, through his
ilaughter Mercy, who in 1677, as the widow
of Resolved Waterman, became the wife
of Samuel" Winsor, Joshua Winsor's only
son.

Dr. Windsor obtained her early education
in the public schools of Providence. In 1885
she received her medical degree from the
Boston University, graduating as speaker of
her class. She spent one year as house phy-

siciau at the Massachusetts Homoeopathic
Hospital, and in 1(S86 went abroad for study
and hospital work in Vienna. Returning to
Boston in 1SS7,. she began practice, l)eing
soon after a]&gt;pointed assistant in obstetrics
at the Boston University School of Medicine.
In 1889 she entered the College of Lil)eral
Arts, and four years later receivetl her tlegree
of A.B.

Dr. Windsor was the first woman president
of the Boston Homa^opathic Medical Society,
attaining that distinction in 1899. In 1902
came another recognition of her ability: she
was then appointed as one of the staff at
the Massachusetts HonKeo])athic Hospital,
being the first woman to receive such an
appointment for a full term of service. She
is one of the directors and a member of the
College Club of Boston. At present she is
obstetrician to the maternity department of
the Massachusetts Honiccopathic Hospital and
associate professor of olistetrics at the Boston
University Medical School.



STELLA EDWARDS FIERPONT
DRAKE, now in the ranks of success-
ful New England business women, was
born in Sturgis, Mich., December 1,
1855. Daughter of Addison Tuttle and Cath-
erine (McKinney) Drake and the eldest of
a family of five children, on the paternal side
she is a descendant of Robert Drake, an early
settler of Hampton, N.H., and through her
mother is a grand-tlaughter of Mary Edwards,
who was a great-grand-daughter of Jonathan
Edwards, theologian and metaphysician, char-
acterized by John Fiske as " probably the great-
est intelligence that the western hemisphere
has yet seen."

Robert Drake came from Colchester, Essex
County, England, to New England before
1643, lived for a time in Exeter, N.H., and
in 1651 settled in Hampton, N.H. His de-
scendants in colonial times were prominent
in public affairs, several of them serving
with distinction in the French and Indian
War and in the Revolution. The next four
ancestors in this line, successively named
Abraham, were among the wealthy men



of Hampton, N.H., and very active in the
affairs of that town and vicinity, where the
original Drake farms and homestead may still
be seen.

Among the rei)resentatives of the family
in later days in this vicinity were Samuel
Gardner Drake, the anti(|uary, an early jiresi-
dent of the New England Historical and Gen-
ealogical Society, and his son, Samuel Adams
Drake, the well-known author.

Tlie fourth Abraham Drake in direct line,
Colonel Abraham,'" born in 1715, married for
his first wife Abigail Weare, daughter of Na-
thaniel Weare, of Hampton, Justice of the
Su])erior Court, and was father of Weare"
Drake, born in 1738, who married Anne Tay-
lor and settled in Effingham, N.H. John'
Drake, son of AVeare" and his wife Anne, was
father of Weare* Drake, who married Lydia
Tuttle, and grandfather of Addison Tuttle
Drake, who was born in Eflingham, N.H., in
1822, and died in Kalamazoo, Mich., in 1890.

Catherine McKinney, l)orn in Binghamton,
N.Y., in 1834, daughter of James and Mary
(Edwards) McKinney, was married to Addi-
son T. Drake in February, 1855. She is now
residing in California. Her Edwards ancestry
in America began with William' Edwards (son
of the Rev. Richard Edwards, a Welsh clergy-
man), who came over about 1640, and in 1646
was a landholder in Hartford, Conn. The
line continued through Richard,^ born in 1647,
and his first wife, Elizabeth Tuttle; the Rev.
Timothy,M3orn in 1669 (Harvard Coll., A.B. and
A.M., July 4, 1691), who married Esther Stod-
dard, and was pastor of the church at East
Windsor, Conn.; Jonathan,^ above named,
born in 1703 (Yale, A.B. 1720), who married
Sarah Pierpont, was for twenty-five years
minister at Northampton, later had charge
of a missionary cliurch in Stockbridge, and
at the time of his death in 1758 was President
of Princeton College; Timothy,'^ born in 1738,
who married Rhoda Ogden; to Edward" Ed-
wards, born in Stockbridge, Mass., in 1763,
who married Mary Ballard, of Hadley, and
was the father of Mary Edwards, born in 1792,
who became the wife of James McKinney and
mother of Catherine, as noted above.

Sarah Pierpont, a woman of great personal

beauty and loveliness of character, the wife
of Jonathan Edwards, was the tlaughter of the
Rev. James Pieri^ont, of New Haven. Her
mother, Mrs. Mary Hooker Pierpont, was
daughter of the Rev. HamueF and Mary (Wil-
lett) Hooker and grand-daugliter of the Rev.
Thomas' Hooker, of Hartford, and of Captain
Thomas Willett, sometime of Plymouth Col-
ony and later the first Mayor of New York City.

Addison Tut tie Drake for many years was
interestetl in the iron and foundry business
in Sturgis, Mich. He served as Quartermas-
ter of the Eleventh Michigan \'olunteer In-
fantry during the Civil War, and at its close
was honorably discharged with the rank of
Captain. He was an earnest advocate of tem-
perance and an active nunnber and trustee
of the Methodist Ejjiscopal church. For about
eight years and till within a few months of his
death he held a position in the War Depart-
ment in Washington, D.C.

Mr. Drake is survived t)y his wife Catherine
and five children, namely: Stella E. P., the
sul)ject of this sketch; Edward Edwards, man-
ager for the Pacific coast tei-ritory of the Union
Metallic Cartridge Company of New York;
Caroline E. Bailey, a widow, of San Francisco,
who has two sons, Edwards and Leonard :
Katherine M., wife of W. R. Herbert, of San
Francisco, who has a son, Claude Drake, and
a daughter, Stella Marguerite; and Jeanne
Ogden, wife of Edwin M. Miller, of Salt Lake
City, Utah, who has two daughters, Elizabeth
and Golda.

Stella E. P. Drake was educated in the
public schools of Sturgis, Mich. At the age
of twenty-three she removed to Kalamazoo,
where she improved her opportunities for intel-
lectual culture by joining study classes in his-
tory, art, and literature, conducted by James
an(l Lucinda H. Stone, teachers of rare gifts
and attainments, also receiving private instruc-
tion from Mrs. Stone, whom at one time she
served as secretary. The intimacy thus fos-
tered yielded to the eager student large returns
in the way of liberal education. Socially she
was a welcome and helpful presence, often
assisting with her fine elocutionary powers at
local public entertainments, acting for one year
as secretary of the Ladies' Library Club, and



also serving for some time as chairman of its
Miscellaneous Conuuittee. After a few years
of married life it became nece.ssary for her to
support herself, an entirely new experience.
This led her to resume her maiden name, by
which she has ever since been known. In 1S96
Mrs. Drake came East to join the army of
self-supporting and self-respecting women. She
was eciuipped for the battle with courage, a
firm will, and both natural and acciuired ability.
Numbering among her personal friends, besides
Lucinda H. Stone, above mentioned (now de-
ceased), such women as Frances Willard, Mary
A. Livermore, the Rev. Anna Shaw, the Rev.
Caroline Bartiett Crane, and Alice Ives Breed,
she dill not lack sagacious counsel and kindly
intercession.

After working for some months for various
publishing houses, she became connected with
tiie Boston agency of the Mutual Life Insur-
ance Company of New York, and in 1900 suc-
ceeded Mrs. M. A. F. Potts as manager of its
women's department, the first to be organized
in connection with any life insurance company
in Boston. Under her management this depai't-
ment has grown to be a factor in life insurance
recognized by the different companies as well as
by the insuring public at large. In training
women for the profession of life insurance, to tlo
the work intelligently and conscientiously, and
thus with a success gratifying to all concerned,
Mrs. Drake has shown herself an adept. As
shown from the unanimous testimony of her
associates, she possesses in a marked degree
tact, dignity of character, a keen sense of
honor, and exceptional (jualifications for direct-
ing the work of others, being one of the few to
whom authority means nothing more or less
than the courteous and appreciative recognition
of the rights and interests of those who act
under her instructions.

Mrs. Drake is a member of the Ciiurch of
the Disciples, and has been a worker along
charitable lines. She belongs to the Massa-
chusetts Woman Suffrage Association, and.
she retains her membership in the above men-
tioned Ladies' Library Society and also in the
Twentieth Century Club of Kalamazoo, of
which .she was one of the founders.

Of the Aaron Burr Legion, founded by



414



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Charles Felton Pklgin, author of "Blenncr-
hassett," for the purpose of historical research,
she is an active member, holding the office of
vice-councillor. Her interest in the work of
the legion is thus explained: —

As is well known, Aaron Burr, thiril Vice-
President of the United States, was a grandson
of Jonathan Edwards, theologian, Presitlent
of Princeton College. His mother was Estlicr
Edwards, daughter of the Rev. Jonathan and
wife of the Rev. Aaron Burr, Sr. Her son,
Aaron Burr, was cousin to Edward" Edwards;
and Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia Bun-
Alston, and Mary Edwards McKinney, Mrs.
Drake's grandmother, were second cousins.

From her girlhood the story of Theodosia
Burr, with its mysterious tragical ending,
has had for Mrs. Drake a strong fascination.
The brief verdict, "Lost at sea," was supjile-
mented in 1850, some years before the birth of
Stella Drake, by the confession of an aged
pauper in the Cassopolis (Mich.) poorhouse,
that he had been one of the pirates by whom
the "Patriot," the vessel in which Mrs. Alston
had taken passage at Charleston, S.C., on De-
cember 30, 1812, for New York, had been capt-
ured, and that he himself had been set to
tip the plank on which she walked to her death
off the stormy shore of Cape Hatteras. He
remembered her for her marvellous beauty
and her unshrinking fortitude.

This grewsome tale was told to Mrs. Drake's
grandmother McKinney by a Mrs. Parks, who
heard the confession.

One of Mrs. Drake's sisters, Mrs. Jeanne
Ogden Miller, of Salt Lake City, bears a strik-
ing resemblance in the general outline of her
features to Vanderlyn's portrait, a profile
view, of Theodosia Burr, as reproduced in
James Barton's "Life of Aaron Burr."

A comparison of the photograph of another
sister, Mrs. Katherine McKinney Herbert,
with the photograph of a painted portrait,
supposed to be that of Theodosia Burr, reveals
a marked likeness between the two. Of this
more below.

It was from an article in a Chicago news-
paper that Mrs. Drake, while living at her
father's home in Sturgis, Mich., first heard of
the existence in Elizabeth City, N.C., of a



portrait which was thought to represent the
daughter of Aaron Burr. It was owned by
a Dr. Pool. In the sunmier of 1888 Mrs. Drake,
then staying with her parents at Virginia
Beach, N.C., visited the home of the Pool
family, only a few miles distant. On the parlor
wall, over the mantle-piece, hung the portrait
of a young woman of great beauty, dressed
in white. She knew it at once as the picture
she had come to see, and she felt confirmed
in her belief that it was a portrait of Theo-
dosia Burr because it resembled her sister,
Katherine McKinney Heibert. Miss Pool (now
Mrs. Overman), daughter of the deceased
doctor, told her how it came into her father's
possession, as the gift of a patient, a Mrs. Mann,
to whom it had lieen given by a sailor lover many
years l)efore. The portrait and two silk dresses
that accompanied it as presents had been taken
from an abandoned pilot boat off Cape Hat-
teras, these articles being found in the cabin.
The sailors who boarded the boat found, or
professed to have found, nothing to identify
either the vessel or the owner of the dresses
and the f)riginal of the portrait. After the
picture came into the possession of Dr. Pool
and its story became' known, it was surmised
that the jiilot boat was the missing "Patriot,"
and the dresses a part of the wardrobe of Theo-
dosia BiuT Alston, of whom the picture is
considered by Mrs. Drake to be an undoubted
likeness.

Mrs. Drake's story of the picture will be
retold by Mr. Pidgin in his forthcoming book,
whose object is to throw light on the mystery
that enshrouds the fate of the beautiful and
accomplished Theodosia Burr.



A ELIZABETH NEWELL and OPHE-
LIA S. NEAVELL, twin daughters
. of Fisher Ames and Ann Elizabeth
(Whipple) Newell, were born June
6, 1841, at the home of their maternal
grandfather, Benjamin Whipple, in Charles-
town, Mass. A. I'^Iizabeth, the first named of
the two sisters, is now the .sole female survivor
of her father's family.

Miss Newell's father, Fisher Ames Newell,
a sea captain, was son of Thomas and Polly



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



415



(Fhipps) Newell and grandson of Andrew New-
ell, of Sherborn, Mass., who was born in Charles-
town in 1729, son of An(h-ew Newell, Sr.

Polly, wife of Thomas Newell, was a daugh-
ter of Jedediah^ Phipjis and great-grand-daugh-
ter of John' Phipps, of Wrenthani, nephew and
adopted son of Sir Willianr Phipps (James'),
colonial Governor of Massachusetts.

Benjamin Whipple, above mentioned, was
a man of progressive and lilx-ral thouglit, of
remarkalile aliility and intelligence. He was
prominent in public life, serving several years
in the Legislature and in almost every office
in the town government, at one time head of
the fire department, and many years a popular
connnander of the Charlestown Light Infantry
and hence known as Captain Whipple. He
served eighteen years as inspector of tlie Boston
Custom House. He belonged, it is said, to
the old Massachusetts family of this name from
which sprang General \Mlliam Whipple, a na-
tive of Kittery, Me., one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence. Captain Whip-
ple's wife, Catherine Coats, whom he married
in Boston in July, ISOl, was an amiable woman
antl one in whom the poor and needy always
found a friend. Miss Newell's mother was the
second of the seven children of Benjamin and
Catherine Whipple. Fond of Ixjoks and study
from her early childhood, she was sent to the
acatlemy in Derry, N.H., then under the charge
of the now famous Mary Lyon. She began
teaching school at the age of sixteen, antl for
twelve years was considered one of the best
teachers in Charlestown and vicinity. She
was always studious and progressive. In all
her trials of after years, and they were oiany,
she showed her courage and Christian spirit
in the sweetness with which she met them.
She was to every one who came within her in-
fluence a woman of unusual magnetism, a
mother of mothers.

Captain Newell was a man of energy and
ability. In 1846, having received a commission
from King Kamahamaha III. to build a schooner
for business purposes, he sailed around Cape
Horn to the Hawaiian Islands, only to return
to build another, the king offering him good
business and citizenship of the place. This
he accepted, and with his family sailed to



those far-away islantls. This was in the days
of rare conununication, and the isolation was
complete. In 1848 and 1S49 the excitement
became intense over the gold discoveries in
California, and Captain Newell was the first
to bring the news, as his vessel several years
after was the first to go to Australia with j)as-
sengers and freight from San Francisco. The
Hawaiian Islands, at this time (middle of the
nineteenth century) so far away from civiliza-
tion, ])resented much that was novel and in-
teresting, besides being the theatre of many
exciting events. It was an ideal home for
children, but lacking in educational advan-
tages. A school called the Royal School was
finally opened, and into it were gathered dark
and white chiefs and chiefes.ses. For playmate
and schoolmate Liliuokalani (now the ex-
queen) was the favorite of the Newell children.

In 1853 Captain and Mrs. Newell anil fam-
ily left Honolulu and returned to the Lhiited
States. They made their home in Charles-
town for a short time; but, when Captain New-
ell returned to his profession, the daughters
were placed at the West Newton English and
Classical School, then in charge of the Rev.
Cyrus Pierce and Nathaniel T. Allen. Here
they' received the greater part of their educa-
tion. Here they became interested in the
anti-slavery cause and woman suiTrage, form-
ing their own opinions anil broadening their
thoughts.

In 1860, under adverse circumstances, the
father having given his life to the ocean, the
widowed mother and her daughters came to
South Boston. After various struggles the
Misses Newell began their work in the schools.
In 1862 the subject of this sketch became a
teacher in the Lawrence district. Later she
was in the Norcross, and afterward was pro-
moted to the position, of first assistant in the
Cyrus Alger Primary School.

In January, 1882, Mrs. Newell died, and her
death was followed, in February, 1883, by that
of the daughter Ophelia. Thus deprived of
tliose whose lives had been hitherto so closely
connected with her own. Miss Newell threw
her energies more strongly into the cause of
woman. She has been a firm believer in her
sex and an advocate for woman's advancement

in all directions. Miss Newell is a woman of
broad Christian spirit and an earnest worker
in the Unitarian church. She has been and
is an active worker in many lines. She organ-
ized the Mattapannock Club of South Boston,
which has a representative membership and
is a benefit to the district. Miss Newell is a
strong suffragist. When Mrs. Julia W^ard
Howe organized a branch in South Boston,
she and her mother and sister were some of
the first to respond. Mi.ss Newell was a mem-
ber of the first Ward and City Committee in
the early days of women's voting and among
the first to cast her vote.

She was among the first to become inter-
ested in the Associated Charities when a branch
was formed in South Boston, and as far as able
she continues to hold her interest in the work
of the organization. She was the first ])resi(lent
of the Primary Teachers' Association of Bos-
ton, and has been for eight years president of
the Lady Teachers' Association of South Bos-
ton. This association was formed in LS74,
it being the only one where relief in case of
sickness is made prominent. She is a member
of the Denison and Boston Teachers' Club,
president of the Mattapannock Club, corre-
sponding secretary of Hawes Church Women's
Alliance, and historian for the Dorchester
Heights Chapter, I). R. She is a good presid-
ing officer. She writes with ease and fluency,
and has given many lectures.

Miss Newell has always been very patriotic
and devoted to the interests of her country.
At the breaking out of the Civil War, while
waiting for an opportunity to enter the public
schools, she gave her time to her country, and
was one of the first to enter Liberty Hall, in
Boston, when busy fiands made light work
of much that was needed in those days. Again,
years after, during the Spanish-American War,
when organizations were formed for a,ssisting
the soldiers, she gave the greater part of her
vacation to the cause, although greatly in need
of a change from her long, continuous lal)or
of teacliing.

Miss Newell has made many ocean voyages
with her father and mother, having been around
Cape Horn four times. Her travels have been
extensive, and she has usetl her opportunities



for the benefit of others. Her life to the pres-
ent has been a strenuous one, with many tragic
and strange jjcriods: but the privations and
trials have given her place among women who
have striven to overcome difficulties, and have
made them stepping-stones to a broad and
noble life.



MARY ALDERSON ATHERTON was
l)orn in Pennsylvania, near the vil-
lage of LeRaysville. Her parents,
John and Margaret Alderson, were
English ])eople whose chief wealth consisted
of their eleven children, eight boys and three
girls. In 1881 Miss Alderson married Willard
M. Chandler, of Boston, a leader in liberal
thougiit, who died in 1889. In 1903 Mrs.
Chandler liecame the wife of Frederick Ather-
ton, a well-known attorney of Boston.

Her education began in the typical coim-
try school, o]ien three months in winter and
three in summer. It was continued at the vil-
lage academy one term and at the Orwell Hill
graded school three terms, a teacher's certificate
then being granted her at the age of fifteen.
At sixteen, or as early as the law of the Key-
stone State permitted, she began teaching in
a small country school in what was locally
known as the "Cleveland District."

Having entered upon the work to which
she was by nature inclined, she determined
to gain in it the front rank. This necessi-
tated a broader education and special training,
and from what source the requisite funds were
to come was an unsolved and seemingly hope-
less -{jroblem. But at this critical juncture
Fate took her by the hand, and, as if, in its
earnest aspirations, one soul had bounded over
the intervening mountains and wildernesses and
struck a responsive chord in the heart of another,
a letter came from a good elder Brother, who
many years before had gone prospecting in the
rough country that lay toward the setting sun.
The letter said in ])art : "The little sister whom
I left behind me years ago must be a young
lady by this time, and I want her to be given
an education. Send her away to school. Here
is two hundred dollars as a starter, and if
I make a big stake, as I have a good show to

do, will send more when needed." This un-
expected opportunity was eagerly seized, and
Miss Alderson, entering the State Normal
School at Mansfield, Pa., was graduated with
the honors of her class two years later.

The first three years of her i)ublic life were
spent in teaching in Venango City (since merged
into Oil City) and Franklin, in the heart of the
Pennsylvania oil district. At [the end of this
period she ventured across the continent to
California, the land of lier girlhood dreams.

In four weeks after her arrival she began
teaching in Gait, a small town near Sacramento,
at a salary of .seventy-five dollars jier month.
The next year found her, with an increa.sed
salary, at San Jose, where for several years
she held the position of vice-principal in the
Empire School. Later she went to the city
of Oakland, where her career as a teacher in
the public schools terminated finally.

Yearning for growth, she gave up a certainty
for an uncertainty, and with characteristic
.self-reliance resolutely turnetl toward the un-
known future. Boarding an ocean steamer
and waving a farewell to the friends on shore,
she sailed out of the Golden Gate with the
fixed purpose of entering upon a new, broader,
and therefore more u.seful career. Going first
to Philadelphia, she spent one year in study
in that city, and th(&gt;n, in 1S8I, came to Boston,
the field of her later activities.

Here, in a strange city, with new surround-
ings, occui^ation gone, restless for something
to tlo, .she incidentally entered upon the study
of shorthand, at that time attracting con-
siderable public attention, to the practical
development of which, along original lines,
she has since devotetl her time, talent, anil
financial resources. The chief features of her
achievements in this direction may be briefly
sunnnari'zed as follows: — ■

In 1883 instituted "The Home School of
Shorthand and Typewriting." In 1888 pub-
lished her first shorthand text-book, "The
Chandler Practical Shorthand for Schools and
Colleges," now in its sixth edition and exten-
sively used in the public schools of New Eng-
lanil. In 1890 introiluceil her system of .short-
hand into the Gloucester High School, when&gt;
its merit was promptly recognized. In 1893



founded the Chandler Normal Shorthantl School,
chiefly for the training of teachers, the first
.school of its kind in the world. In 1895 called
a Public School Shorthand Convention, the
first in the history of education. In 1895
foundeil the f^handler Thinking Club, for the
promotion of individual growth by indepen-
dent thinking. In 1898 founded a periodical
called The Thinker, which has met with a cordial
rece])tion at the hands of the public.

The original i)lanks of her shorthaiul educa-
tional platform were two — "Quality, not quan-
tity," "Legibility, not guessibility" — to which
the following has since been added, "A uni-
form shorthantl in the public schools.'

Mrs. Atherton is a member of the Free Re-
ligious Association of America, an organization
broad enough to meet the retjuirements of her
liberal spirit.

Being the embodiment of enthusiasm, she is
a natural leader and to the young an unfailing
source of inspiration. The high esteem in
which she is held by those who have come under
her direct influence is indicateil by the following
extract from the constitution of the National
Association of Chandler Shorthand Writers, re-
cently (1904) organized by them: "The object
of this association .shall be to extend and per-
petuate, through the means of a permanent
organization, the valuable work which Mary
Aklerson Atherton has done for humanity in
the interest of true education and character-
building."

It may be truthfully said that Mrs. Atherton
has contributed something of value to the age
in which she lives.



KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN (Mrs. George
C. Riggs) is an author whom New
Englanders like to claim as one of
their own number, her inherited tastes
and aptitudes being derived from generations
of New p]nghuKl ancestry. Of the dift'erent
localities that have known her as a resident
she herself has thus s|joken: "Pennsylvania
was the State of my birth, Maine was where my
childhood and happy girlhood were passed,
California is the scene of all the practical work
I have done among poor children, while my



418



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



married life the past nine years has been divided
between New York and Great Britain." (She
became the wife of George C. Riggs in 1895.)

Born in Philadelphia, daughter of Robert
Noah and Helen E. (Dyer) Smith, she is a
grand-daughter of Noah, Jr., and Hannah
( W'heatoii) Smith and of Jones and Lydia
(Knight) Dyer, all of Maine in their day, and
great-grand-daughter of Noah Smith, Sr., of the
South Parish of Reading (now Wakefield),
Mass., born in 1775, who was a Captain of
cavalry in the State militia. Captain Noah
Smith is spoken of by the historian of Reading
as a "man of great vivacity, intelligence, and
public spirit, remarkable for an inexhaustible
fund of witty anecdote and lively story, with
large develo])ment of language and mirtlifuliK'.ss.
His father was Captain David Sm'itli.

Noah Smith, Jr., son of Captain Noah and
his wife Mary, daughter of Paul Sweetser, of
Reading, was born in 1800. He settled in
Maine, where he became prominent in pul)lic
life, serving for a number of years as Speaker
of the House in the State Legislature and later
as clerk in Congress.

Kate Douglas Smith, the subject of our
.sketch, was educated first at her home in Hollis,
a small Maine village, then at Gorham Seminary
near by, and later at Abbot Academy, An-
dover, Mass.

In 1873 the family removed to Santa Bar-
bara, Cal., and in 1876, while living in (Cali-
fornia, the future chronicler of childhood
studied kindergarten methods under Emma
Marwedel, and, after teaching in the Santa
Barbara College for a year, she organized in
San Francisco the first free kindergarten west
of the Rocky Mountains. This school, the
Silver Street Kindergarten, was in a quarter of
the city where squalor and poverty reigned
supreme, and it was to the very poor that she
began giving liberally her time, energy, and
enthusiasm. She .soon saw the need of trained
assistants, and in 1880 she organized the Cali-
fornia Kindergarten Training School.

After her marriage in the same year to Samuel
B. Wiggin, of Sail Francisco, the training school
was conducted by her sister, Miss Nora Archi-
bald Smith, who had been associated with her
in the Silver Street Kindergarten. In 1888



Mrs. Wiggin removed with her husband to New
York, where he died in 1889.

Mrs. AMggin, while living as a widow in New
York, thnnv herself with great energy into the
kindergarten movement in that city, and it
was in this interest that she was drawn into the
semi-public reading of her own stories.
::; Her first |)uljli.shed story, ''Half-a-dozen
Hous(&gt;keep(&gt;rs," written in California when she
was eighteen, appeared in St. Nicholas in No-
veml)er and December, 1878. "The Story of
Patsy," writtim for the l)enefit of the kinder-
garten, is said to have reachetl a sale of three
thousand copies without the aid of a publisher.
The " Birds' Christmas C'arol," whose sale was
ec|ually large, has been translated into Jajianese,
French, German, Danish, and Swedish, and has
been put in raised type for the blind. Among
her other books may be mentioned "Polly
Oliver's Problem," "A Summer in a Canon,"
three volumes relating to kindergarten work (of
which she was joint author with her sister,
Nora A. Smith),' "The Milage Watch-tower,"
"Timothy's Quest," "A Cathedral Courtship,"
the three Penelope books, " Diary of a Goose-
girl," and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm."
Plea.sant River, in "Timothy's (Juest," is said
to have been drawn from the Hollis locality,
the summer home of Mrs. Riggs.

British opinion of "Rebecca" is indicated in
the following press notices: "Child or girl,
Rebecca is just delightful. . . . The opening
chapter, relating the conversation between
Mr. Cobb, the driver of the stage-coach, and
Rebecca, as he conveys her to Aunt Mirandy's,
is, in its subtle humor and simple pathos, equal
to any parallel passage in Dickens. Rebecca
is thoroughly refreshing" (Punch).

"This is a story that will be read and reread.
. . . Tears and laughter will greet her, but smiles
and laughter will predominate. We have no
doubt of the success of ' Rebecca of Sunnybrook
Farm' " {Glasgow Herald).

" Rebecca is as charming and as new, as hu-
morous and as natural, as ever was anything
in a story or out of it . . . touches literature
of a very high order" {Country Life).

Mrs. Riggs goes abroad yearly, Init usually
spends the summer wholly or in ])art at Hollis,
where she is a welcome guest, for the old and

young love her. She takes up work in the old
Orthodox church on Tory Hill, playing the organ,
singing when needed, helping in the Suntlay-
school library. She opens her house, " Quilleote,"
for sociables and sewing-circles, and every
autumn, just before leaving for her New York
home, she gives a reading from her own books
for the benefit of the old church, the only public
reading she gives nowadays.

During her absence in Scotland in .June, 1904,
Bowdoin College conferred on Mrs. Kiggs the
honorary degree of Doctor of Literature.



MARY ANN WRIGHT CHAPMAN,
Past State Regent of the Daugh-
ters of the Revolution, is a native
of Phillipston, Mass., and the daugh-
ter of Sylvester Carpenter and Susan D. (Bur-
bank) Wright. Her father was for many years
a manufacturer of iron-working machinery in
Fitchburg, where the greater part of her life
has been passetl.

Her grandparents on the paternal side were
W'illiam Kendall and Relief (Bowker) Wright,
and on the maternal, Arthur and Sarah (Bates)
Burl)ank. One line of her grantlfather Bur-
bank's ancestry goes back to John Webster,
who was Governor of Connecticut in 1656;
and one line of her grandmother Burl)ank's
(born Bates), to Stephen Hopkins, of the
"Mayflower" company of Pilgrims, 1620. De-
scent from Governor Webster is through his
daughter Mary, who married a Mr. Hunt; Jon-
athan Hunt; Jonathan Hunt, Jr., and his wife,
Martha Williams; Mary Hunt, who marrieil
Seth Pomeroy; Sarah Pomeroy, born in 1744,
who married Abraham Burbank, and was the
mother of Arthur Burbank, grandfather of
Mrs. Chapman.

Descent from Stephen Hopkins Mrs. Chap-
man traces through his daughter Constance,
who married Nicholas Snow; Mary Snow, wife
of Thomas Paine; Mary Paine Cole; Hannah
Cole Higgins; Israel Higgins; Ruth Higgins,
wife of Ca]itain Abner Stocking; Hannah Stock-
ing, wife of Eleazer Bates; Sarah Bates, wife
of Arthur Burbank and mother of Susan Doo-
little Burbank, who (as indicated above) mar-
j'ietl Sylvester Carpenter Wright.



Among the ancestors of Mrs. Chapman who,
as military men or as civilians, engaged in the
public service in colonial times, may be men-
tioned Deacon Medad Pomeroy, of Northamp-
ton, who was a soldier at Turner's Falls in
King Philip's War, 1676, and who served as
Town Clerk and Treasurer, Register of Deeds,
Associate County Judge, and Deputy to Gen-
eral Court; Ebenezer Pomeroy, Captain and
then Major in the militia and high sheriff of
the county; also General Seth Pomeroy and
four other Revolutionary soldiers — namely.
Captain Abner Stocking, John Bowker, Eleazer
Bates, and Nehemiah Wright.

Seth Pomeroy served with distinction in
the French and Indian wars. He was Major
in the Massachusetts forces at the capture of
Louisburg in 1745, was Lieutenant Colonel in
the expedition against Crown Point in 1755, and
at the death of Colonel Williams in the battle
of Lake George, September 8, 1755, he took
connnand of the regiment and ably assisted in
winning the victory. In 1774-75 he was a
delegate to the Provincial Congress. He was
elected a Brigadier-general in February, 1775.
He fought at Bunker Hill as a private, and
was soon after appointeil a senior Brigadier-
general by the Continental Congress, but de-
clined the honor in consequence of disputes
about military rank, and retired to his farm.

In the autunui of 1776, when New Jersey
was invaded by the British, at the earnest
solicitation of Washington, he again took the
field, and, at the heail of the military force he
had raised, marched as far as the Hudson River
at Peekskill, where he was taken ill with pleu-
risy, and died in February, 1777, in the seventy-
first year of his age.

On June 17, 1898, it may be mentioned,
Mrs. Chapman attended the unveiling of the
monument in the old churchyard at Peekskill,
erected by the Sons of the Revolution anil his
descendants. One of the inscriptions reads
as follows: —

Peekskill, February 1], 1777.
I go cheerfully, for I am sure the cause we are en-
gaged in is just ; and the call I have to it is clear and



the call of God.



Seth Pomeroy.

great-grandfather of Mrs. Chapman, was gradu-
ated at Yale College in 1759. A prominent
lawyer and a judge, he served a number of
years as a member of the Massachusetts Leg-
islature, and in 1777 was a commissary for
forwarding stores. His fine old colonial man-
sion is still standing at Feeding Iliiis, Mass.
His mother was sister to Colonel Timothy
Dwight, grandfather of President Timotiiy
Dwight, of Yale College.

Mrs. Chapman, under her maiden name,

L. Chapman, son of Daniel Chapman, who was
then engaged in manufacturing in Fitchburg in
company with Mr. Wright, her father. He is
now retired.

The children of Mr. and Mrs. Chapman are:
Walter Butler (who died in infancy), Josephine
Wright, (ieorge Daiuel (deceased), and Louis
Raymond. Josephine AV right Chapman is an

and Boston LTniversity, is a practising lawyer
in Boston.

Mrs. Chapman was one of the first meml)ers



of the Fitchburg Woman's Club, was a direc-
tor and chairman of the science section and
superintendent of the household school for
three years, when that work brought the club

CAROLINE H. HITCHCOCK



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



421



CAROLINE HANKS HITCHCOCK was
born September 20, 1863, in Lowell,
Mass. From that city during her early
chiUlhood she came to the house on
Harvard Street, Cambridge, which is still her
home. Her parents were the Rev. Stedman
Wright Hanks and Sarah Hale Hanks. Her
father was descended from an old English
family of Malmesbury, near the great Stone-
henge in Wiltshire. " All the Malmesbury men
who fought in the battle of I']ddington under
Alfred the Great were rewarded with certain
tracts of land, which are still held by the de-
scendants of these old families. Among these
so called ' connnoners,' each of whom had five
hundred acres, were two brothers of the name
Hankes, who.se descendants still hold the ' com-
moners' rights' in Malmesbury, King Athelstan,
the grandson of Alfred the Great, having given
them one charter, King John another later, and
so on."

It was along the old Roman Foss Road that
the first known ancestor of Mrs. Hitchcock trav-
elled when he ventured to leave his native place.
This was Thomas Hanks, who then .settled in
Stow-on-the-Wold, and whose son Benjamin
with his wife Abigail "came from, London, Oc-
tober 17, 1699, and landed in Plymouth, Massa-
chusettts." This Benjamin Hanks was the
great-grandfather of Nancy Hanks, the mother
of Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of the
United States. The olil records show that " the
history of the descendants of Benjamin Hanks
is interwoven in the annals of New England,
where they are known as 'a remarkably inven-
tive family' ami 'a family of founders.' The
first bells ever made in America were cast on
Hanks Hill in their old New England farm.

"Mrs. Hitchcock's great-grandfather, one of
the descendants of this Benjamin Hanks, placed
in the steeple of the old Dutch Church in New
York City the first tower clock in America, a
iuu(iue affair, run by a windmill attachment.
The bells antl chimes made by members of
the Hanks family, are now ringing all over the
world, on land and sea, one of them being the
bell in Philadelphia which replaced the old
Liberty Bell, and another the great Columbian
liberty bell, which hung in front of the Ad-
mini.stration Building at the World's Fair in



Chicago in 1893. This bell weighed thirteen
thousand pounds, to represent the thirteen
original States, and was made from relics of
gold, silver, old coins, antl metal sent from all
parts of the world. On it were inscribed the
words, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth ])eace, good will toward men'; also these:
' Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto
all the inhabitants thereof,' and 'A new com-
mandment I give unto you. That ye love one
another.'"

It was Mrs. Hitchcock's great-grandfather
who erected the first silk-mill in America to
run by water-j)ower. He also made the first
cannon carried by the Connecticut artillery
into the battles in which many of the family
gave their lives for their country. For the
United States army and navy during the Revo-
lution the Hanks inventions in almost every
department were manifold. The founder of
the American Bank Note Company antl also
the discoverer of the new mineral in California,
named, after Professor Hanks, " Hanksite," were
of her family. Sunday-school publications
prepared by a member of this family from
a careful research into the Hebrew language
and literature have been studied all over
America.

Mrs. Hitchcock's father was the author of
the well-known Black \^alley Railroad temper-
ance illustrations and of many books on the
subject of temperance. Realizing the needs of
those who "go down to the sea in ships, that
ilo business in great waters," he instituted
sailors' librai'ies. His daughter well remembers
helping prepare the first little box of books
that was sent on board ship as a "library," and
which was ivally the nucleus of what has become
a great system of floating libraries.

She is, as was her father, an ardent believer
in temperance. On her mother's side, also, Mrs.
Hitchcock is of English descent. The English
historian Atkyns says, "The family of Hale
has been of ancient standing in this county,
and always esteemed for their probity and
charity." Illustrious names have crowned this
family throughout its history, from Sir Matthew
Hale, Lord C'hief Justice, to the patriot soldier,
Nathan Hale and the beloved minister philan-
thropist, the Rev. Dr. Eilward Everett Hale,



422



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



now chaplain of the United States Senate. Mrs.
Hitchcock's great-grandfather Hale was a sur-
geon in the Revolution, and her grandfather
a drummer boy in the company with his father.
Her mother was born, and lived until she was
sixteen years old, on one of the rare spots on
God's green earth, on the edge of a little lake
called "Indian Pond," in the heart of our
New England mountains, in Orford, N.H.
After teaching in the little red school-house
among the hills, she was called to Lowell,
where, after having taught a few years, she
married. Later she removed with her husband
to Cambridge to educate the children. Here
her daughter, Caroline Hanks, went through the
public schools, and then entered the Harvard
Annex, now Radcliffe College. After leaving
college, she taught in the Harvard School until
her marriage in 1887, when she went with her
husband, Sanmel M. Hitchcock, to New York.
She now lives with her son, James Hitchcock,
on Harvard Street, Cambritlge.

A few years ago Mrs. Hitchcock became in-
tensely interested in theosophy. She is now
president of the Cambridge Lodge of the l^ni-
versal Brotherhood Organization and Theo-
sophical Society, whose head(iuarters are at
Point Loma, Cal. Here the Children's Raja
Yoga School is being carried on with marked
success, and the School for the Revival
of the Lost Mysteries of Anticiuity has been
already established under Katherine Tingley,
of Newburyport, Mass. When asked the other
day, "What are the Mysteries?" Mrs. Hitch-
cock answered: "What, indeed, is there that is
not a mystery? Is not life it-self the Great
Mystery — life, this jjanoramic glimpse be-
tween two vast silences? Raja Yoga is the
Science of Life, the study by means of which
we may come to understand the inner workings
of that great law which has made brotherhood
a fact in nature, and has made life joyful just
in that degree that we recognize that the welfare
of one is indissohibly and forever a part of the
welfare of all. Tlieoso])hy is nior(&gt; than a
name, more than a theory: it is a living, trans-
forming ])()wer, that shall lift the whole world
and fill all life with light and joy. It is the
history of the mental, moral, and spiritual evo-
lution of the sou! on this planet."



Mrs. Hitchcock believes that the future of the
world rests in the hands of the little children.
"At Point Loma hundreds of them," it is said,
" gathered from many nations, are being trained
in the atmosphere of love, the spiritual science
of the soul. Music and art are the transform-
ing powers of life, and here they are taught in
their deepest- meaning. The power of beauti-
ful expression comes from the arousing of the
inner powers of the soul, which are in sym-
pathy with whatever is high and pure. Many
of these little children are homeless waifs, who
are being instructed in the laws of Universal
Nature and Justice, the laws governing their
own being, and the wisdom of mutual helpful-
ness. The children are taught to regard them-
selves as integral and responsible parts of the
nation to which they belong; to aspire to the
position of national benefactors, teachers, and
helpers, and so become exponents of the truest
and wisest patriotism." Mrs. Hitchcock is also
interested in the various branches of this .school,
which are found in all the large centres of Amer-
ica, as well as in her own Cambridge, where
she works indefatigably with the children.

As stated in a recent periodical, she is "en-
thusiastically loyal to her countrywomen, as
she is, indeed, to everything truly American.
She believes heartily in woman suffrage, and
regrets deeply varicnis fraudulent methods that
govern motlern politics." Another subject
which has deeply interested her of late is anti-
compulsory vaccination, on which she spoke
earnestly at the State IIf)use some months ago.
Although she was obliged to refuse the nomi-
nation for presidency of the society of that
name, her heart is entirely in sympathy with
the cause.

The Cambridf/e /-"rfs.s of May 13, 190.3, says:
"As a writer, Mrs. Hitchcock is especially gifted.
Her l)()oks — ' Nancy Hanks, a Story of Abra-
ham Lincoln's Mother' and 'The History of the
Hanks I'^amily in America' — are regarded as
authorities on these subjects. The first clears
up what had b(&gt;en for y(&gt;ars before its publica-
tion mysterious and unsatisfactory with regard
to the biography of tlie most lovable and
noble mother of our great President. As a
lecturer, Mrs. Hitchcock is fluent and inter-
esting as W(&gt;!1 as graceful. Her lectures upon

the different religions of the world, illustrated
with beautiful stereopticon views, are well
known."



DOROTHEA LYNDE DIX.— Over a
grave in Mount Auburn Cemetery,
Massachusetts, the American flag al-
ways waves. It is kejjt there by the
Army Nurses' Association of Boston and the
Grand Army Post, and its presence fittingly
commemorates the service which Dorothea Dix
rendered her country in the war of the Rebellion.

Miss Dix was born April 4, 1802, during the
temporary residence of her parents, Joseph and
Mary (Bigelow) Dix, in Hampden, Me. She
dieil July 17, 1887, at the State Asylum, Tren-
ton, N.J., "one of her hospital homes," where
she had tieen tenderly cared for, a loved and
revered guest, in her declining years of exhaus-
tion and pain.

It has been remarked that Miss Dix seems
to have inherited the strong points of her
character not from her parents, but from her
paternal grandparents. Dr. Elijah Dix and his
wife, Dorothy Lynde. " Her father, Joseph
Dix, was a visionary man f)f delicate health,
and died early. Her mother, after the birth
of her second son, fell into invalidism, leaving
to the child Doi'othea the care of her two broth-
ers, a trust she faithfully fulfilled.

"The grandfather. Dr. Elijah Dix, of whom
Miss Dix always cherished pleasant memories,
was located many years as a physician at
Worcester, where he is remembered to-day as well
developed physically and mentally antl in ad-
vance of his age in village improvement and
educational theories. He was characterized
■for his bravery, honesty, and patriotism. In
1795 he removed to Boston and estalilished a
drug store under Faneuil Hall, and founded in
South Boston chemical works for the refining
of sulplun- and the purifying of canqjlior. He
entered largely into the land speculations in
the State of Maine, purchased large tracts of
forests, out of which he founded the towns of
Dixmont and Dixtield." He died in 1809, his
widow surviving him twenty-eight years.

At twelve years of age Dorothea, lea\'ing
her home in A\'orcester, went to live with her



grantlmother. Madam Dix, in Boston. At
fourteen she opened a school for little chiklren
in Worcester, which she taught in 1816-17.
A number of years later she established in the
Dix mansion in Boston a boarding and day
school, which she continued successfully for
five years, but at the cost of her health. In
her school-teaching days Miss Dix wrote several
books, mostly for children, one of which, "Con-
versation on Common Things," reached its
sixtieth edition. In the spring of 1836 she
broke down completely, and was obliged to
give up school-keeping. Going to England for
change of scene and rest, she returned to Boston
in the autumn of 1837 with her health greatly
improved, but found it necessary to go South
for the following winter. She had received
fiom her grandmother a bequest which, with
what she had saved from lier earnings as a
teacher, gave her a competency, enabling her
henceforth to dispose of her time and follow
her tastes as she would.

She chose to be a worker in a n^uch neglected
field of philanthropy. Visiting in March, 1841,
the jail in East Cambridge, "Miss Dix," says
her biographer, " was first brought face to face
with the condition of things prevailing in the
jails anil almshouses of Massachusetts, which
laimched her on her great career."

Note-book in hand, she visitetl jails and alms-
houses throughout the State, accumulating
statistics of outrage and niLsery, and then
addressed a memorial to the Legislature (Janu-
ary, 1843), showing the need of reform in the
system and appealing for legislative action.
She was supported by such men as Dr. Samuel
G. Howe, Horace Mann, Charles Sumner, and
Dr. Chaiming. The connnittee to which the
menmrial was referred made a report strongly
indorsing the truth of Miss Dix's statements;
and engineered by Dr. Howe, chairman of the
connnittee, a "bill for immediate relief was
carried by a large majority, and the order
passed for providing State acconunodations for
two hundred additional insane persons."

"Thus was venture&lt;l and won Miss Dix's
first legislative victory, the ])recursor of num-
bers to follow throughout the length and
breadth of the United States."

A small asylum in Providence, R.I., receiving



424



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



from Mr. Cyrus Butler, in answer to a personal
appeal from Miss Dix, the sum of fifty thousand
dollars, was enlarged and had its name changed
to Butler Hospital.

Taking up the cause of the insane in New
Jersey, Miss Dix went " from county to county,
making personal investigations, jM'eparing a
memorial to the Legislature, and moving them
to appropriate means for building the Trenton
Hospital with its lofty walls and extensive
grounds. At the same time she was creating
the State Lunatic Asylum at Harrisburg, Pa.
Through her efforts the asylum at Utica, N.Y.,
was doubled in size, and the .4sylum for the
Insane at Toronto, Canada, tniilt. From State
to State, from county to county, Miss Dix
journeyed, seeking out the suffering in jails,
almshouses, and wherever they were to be found,
who had no other earthly heljier. Hos])itals
sprung up at her touch, until she saw structures
of her own creation rise in Lidiana, Illinois,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mis.'iouri, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, North
Carolina, Maryland, Washington, and Halifax,
N.S.

" Far-away Japan owed its first asylum for
the insane to Dorothea L. Dix. She so inter-
ested Mr. Mori, the first Minister from Japan to
the United States, that on his return to his
home he was instrumental in building two
hospitals.

"She was known and loved everywhere.
In 1S5S and 1S59 she visited the hospitals
throughout the South that she had been in-
strumental in founding. She writes in Texas:
' Everybody was kind and obliging. I had a
hundred instances that filled my eyes with tears.
I was taking dinner at a small puljlic house
on a wide, lonely prairie. The master stood
with the stage way-bill in his hand, reading
and eying me. I thought because I was the
only lady ]3assenger; but when I drew out my
purse to pay, as usual, his (|uick expression was:
"No, no! by George, I don't take money from
you! Why, I never thought I should .see you,
and now you are in my house. You have done
good to everybody for years and years. Make
sure, now, there's a welcome for you in every
hou.se in Texas! Here, wife, this is Miss Dix.
Shake hands and call the children."'



"The same kindly spirit was manifested by
the press of the South, which spoke of her as
' the chosen daughter of the Republic,' that
'angel of mercy.'

" It was during this period of her life that
Miss Dix through legislative bodies secured
large sums of money for humane ])urposes,
more than was ever before raised by one in-
dividual.

" At the breaking out of the Civil War Mi.ss
Dix was nearly sixty years of age, but she
entered Washington with the first wounded
soldiers from Baltimore, and reported at once
to Secretary Camei-on as a volunteer nurse
without j)ay, and was by him apjxiinted ' Super-
intentlent of Women Nurses, to select and assign
women nurses to general or jsermanent military
hospitals.'

"While in personal devotion," writes Mr.
Tiffany of Miss Dix (then under the burden of
"responsibilitiesJoo great for any single mind to
cope with"), "no portion of her career surpassed
this, still in wisdom and ])ractical efficiency it
was distinctively inferior to her work in her
own s])here. Of its consecration of purpo.se
there can be no question." Mr. Tiffany testifies
that through the four years of the war "she
never took a day's furlough. Untiringly did
she remain at her post, organizing bands of
nurses, forwarding sup])lies, ins})ecting hos])itals,
and in many a case of neglect and abuse mak-
ing her name a salutary terror."

Secretary Stanton, having a high sense of the
country's indebtedness to Miss Dix for her in-
estima])l(&gt; services on the l)attle-fiel(l, in camps
and hospitals, ordered the jiresentation to her
of a stand of the United States colors. The
beautiful flags, received by her in January,
1867, she bequeathed to Harvard College.'
They now hang in the Memorial Hall, over the
main portal.

Aftei- the war Miss Dix continued general
philanthropic work for many years. Worn
out with fatigue, in October, 1S81, she went
for rest to the Trenton Asylum, which was her
home till the end came.

It has been .said of Mi.ss Dix that personally
she was most attractive. " Her voice was of
a quality that controlled the rudest and most
violent — sweet, lich, low, perfect in enunciation,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



425



pervaded in every tone by love and power.
Her apparel was quiet, spotlessly neat, and
uni(]uely tasteful — the apparel of a delicate,
high-breil Friend. A plain gray dress sufficed
for travelling, a black silk one was reserved for
social and public occasions. A shawl or velvet
mantle without ornament .she ilonned when she
went to meet persons of high rank. Her waving
brown hair was brought over the temples anil
carried above the ears, in the fashion of the
period. Her soft, brilliant, blue-gray eyes,
with pujjils so dilating as to make them appear
black, the bright glow of her cheeks, the well-
set head, and distinction in carriage, all ex-
pressed the blending of ilignity, force, anil ten-
derness in her character."



MARION A. M.\cBRIDE, journalist,
widely known through the country
for her work in the field of tlomestic
science and for her [ihilanthropic
efforts in connection with the Woman's Chris-
tian Temperance Union, is a native of East-
hampton, Mass. Her ancestors, the Snows and
W-arners, have lived in Williamsl)urg, Mass.,
since 1731. Solomon Snow and Jonathan War-
ner responded to the Lexington alarm of April
19, 1775, marching from Hamp.shire County to
the defence of the country.

Mrs. MacBride was educated in New York, but
her home for the greater part of her life has
been in Boston. Her first newspaper work was
done for the Neiv York Tribune in 1881, and
sinco that time her name has been prominent
in the field of journalism. From 1881 to 1885
she was a reporter antl correspondent of the
Bo&gt;&gt;ton Post, but for the j^ast fifteen years .she
has given more time to magazine work. A reg-
ular contributor to the colunms of the Boston
Daily Globe, New York Herald, Nexv Orleans
Picayune, Cleveland Plain Dealer, and St. Louis
Chronicle, she has also conducted a department
in the American Art Magazine, has written arti-
cles for ih^Decorator and Furnisher, and has
filled important jjositions on the leading period-
icals devoted to domestic science.

Mrs. MacBride is noted for her ability as an
organizer. At the Cotton Centennial Exposi-
tion in 1885 she organized the National Woman's



Press Association, which became international
in 1887. The Woman's Press Association of
Ohio, the Southern Woman's Press Association,
and the New p]ngland Woman's Press As.socia-
tion were all called into existence largely through
her personal efforts.

Mrs. MacBride organized the first woman's
tlejmrtment of the New England Manufacturers'
and Mechanics' Institute Fair held in Boston
early in the eighties, and was also organizer
and first superintendent of the woman's depart-
ment of the Massacluisetts Charitable Mechanic
A.ssociation. Long the faithful secretary of the
Woman's Charity Club, she was presented by its
members in 1890 with a handsome gold watch
and badge.

As an honorary member of the Massachusetts
Army Nunses Association, Mrs. MacBride was
l)rominent in arranging for the reception at
Memorial Hall, State House, Boston, August
17, 1904, during the National Encampment of
the Grand Army of the Repulilic.

Mrs. MacBride is a national superintendent of
the W. C. T. U. She is never too busy to con-
sider all sorts of demands made upon her time
and strength, provided they have a worthy ob-
ject. She was one of the first and most effi-
cient workers for the police matron measure in
Boston. For several years Mrs. MacBride has
pas.setl her winters in Philadelphia, where her
only child, James D. MacBride, follows the
profession of draftsman which he learned in
Gla.sgow, Scotland.



FANNIE M. JONES, a prominent worker
in patriotic and other societies, was
born in Boston, daughter of Captain Cal-
vin C. and Harriet K. (Chase) Wilson.
Her father has been connectetl with the Boston'
fire department for more than forty years. He
is an active member of the Masons, the Inde-
pendent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of
Honor, and other organizations. Her mother
is one of the leading members of the Daughters
of Rebekah, of Massachusetts, and is also identi-
fied with the Independent Order of Odd Ladies,
having held the highest offices m both organiza-
tions. Mrs. Jones was educated in the public
schools of Boston, and is a graduate of the



420



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Girls' English High and Normal Schools. She
was fitted for the ])rofession of teacher: but,
soon after beginning this work, she, as Fanni(&gt;
\\'ilson, married Dr. William i'elby Jones, a
physician and surgeon of Boston, whose father,
Dr. Joseph S. Jones, was a prominent surgeon
and active in medical and other societies.

After the death of her husband, in 1&lt;S90,
Mrs. Jones moved to Somerville, where she has
since resided. She is a member of the Prospect
Hill Church, a teacher in its Sunday-school,
and interested in all its various work. She is
a member of Unity Lodge, L 0. of O. L., and
for the past fourteen years has served in all its
offices. She has held office in the State Society,
and in 1902 was Lady Governess of the ortler
(which includes Massachusetts, New Ham])shire,
antl New Jersey), travelling extensively in these
States. She is also connected with the Su-
preme Board.

Mrs. Jones is a member of Erminie Lodge,
Daughters of Rebekah, and has presided at its
meetings as the highest officer, that of Noble
Grand. She is a Past Deputy of the Grand
Lodges. In 1S91 she united witli Willard C.
Kinsley Relief Corps, of Somerville, and in
1894 was president of the corps. She is the
present treasurer, and has been secretary,
performing all the duties of the several offices
in a thorough manner.

In 1895 Mrs. Jones was secretary of the staff
of aides appointed by Mrs. Eva T. Cook, then
Department President W. R. C, to exemplify the
work in different parts of the State. For the
past ten years she has held some position of re-
sponsibility in the Department of Massachu-
setts, W. R. C, and in 1903 was Department
Inspector on the staff of Mrs. Clara H. B.
Evans, Department President. Mrs. Jones has
rendered efficient service as a member for three
years of the Department Executive Board, and
as Inspector she visited every part of the State.
As chairman of the Auditing Conmiittee, as a De-
partment and National Aide, also as Assistant
National Inspector and secretary and treasurer
of large committees, she has proved to be sys-
tematic, capable, and conscientious. In 1903
Mrs. Jones served as a delegate to the National
W. R. C. Convention at San Francisco. She
journeyed nine thousand miles on this trip,



and was a help to her associates in the order,
being always ready to sacrifice her own com-
fort for the hajjpiness of others. A friend has
written of her as follows: "Mrs. Jones is very
business-like in all her methods, yet always
a genial companion and jiopular with her
associates."

Mrs. Jones is treasurer of the Executive
Committee of Arrangements for the National
W. R. C. Convention in Boston (August 15 to
20, 1904), and is a member of the executive,
the floral, and other connnittees.

Mrs. Jones has one daughter, who is a resi-
dent of Hamilton, Mass.



MARTHA PERRY LOWE, poet and
journalist, was born in Keene, N.H.,
November 21, 1829, daughter of
General Justus Perry and his wife,
Hannah W^ood. She was educated in Keene
and in tlie private school of Mrs. Charles Sedg-
wick at Lenox, Mass., then one of the leading
institutions of the kind in New England. She
devoted nmch time in her earlier years to music,
literature and travel.

In September, X857, as Martha Perry, she
married the Rev. Charles Lowe, a Unitarian
minister, who at a later period was known as
one of the leading clergymen of that denomi-
nation in America.

Mr. Lowe was born in Portsmouth, N.H.,
November 18, 1828. His parents were John
and Sarah Ann (Simes) Lowe. While he was
very young, they removed to Exeter, N.H.
His paternal grandparents were Elisha P. and
Maria (Yeaton) Lowe; and his maternal grand-
parents, George and Nancy (Hardy) Simes.

The home of his grandfather Simes was for
many years the headquarters in Portsmouth of
the Universalist ministers, he being an active
member of that denonunation. Mrs. Elizabeth
Yeaton, his father's grandmother, was a de-
voted Unitarian.

Charles Lowe was fitted for college at Phillips
(Exeter) Academy, was graduated A.B. at
Harvard University in 1847 and from the Di-
vinity School in 1851. In 1852 he accepted a
call from the Unitarian church in New Bed-
ford to become colleague to the Rev. John

Weiss. He was onlainctl in July, antl con-
tinued active in the duties of the ministry until
the failure of his health led him to seek rest
and change in foreign travel, (ioing abroad in
September, 1853, he journeyed in Europe,
Egypt, and Syria, and then spent some time
studying in Germany, returning to Boston in
May, 1855. His next pastorate was in Salem
(September, 1855, to July, 1856) ; his third and
last, in Somerville, to which place he removed
with his family in the autumn of 1859, and
where he remained aTesident as long as he lived.
Elected secretary of the American Unitarian
Association in June, 1865, lie served as such
"with singular and growing success" until the
spring of 1871, when his strength gave way and
he resigned the office.

His patriotism during the stirring events of
the Civil War was earnest and practical. His
health not permitting him to enter the army,
he offered his services to Governor Andrew in
any capacity he could fill, and was appointed
chaplain at the camp at J^ong Island. In No-
vember, 1864, as chairman of the Army Com-
mission of the American Unitarian Association,
he visited the soldiers at the front. He also
served as one of the Teachers' Conunittee of the
New England Freedman's Aid Society. In all
these positions he renderetl invaluable service
to the Union cause.

At the time of his death, June 20, 1874, he was
etlitor of the Unitarian Review.

Mr. and Mrs. Lowe had two daughters, both
of whom are married and live in Somerville.
Mrs. Lowe survived her husbantl many years,
her earthly life closing at her pleasant home on
Spring Hill, May 7, 1902. She was devoted to
the higher interests of Somerville, and during
her long resilience in that city slie substantially
aided its charities and schools. In appreciation
of her services in behalf of educational projects
the school board, soon after her death, named a
new building in her memory.

Mrs. Lowe often participated in public gath-
erings, and accepted invitations to read original
poems on special occasions. She was a fre-
([uent contributor to papers and magazines,
and made many earnest appeals for the cause
of charity, temperance, woman suffrage, and
other objects connected with the public welfare.



She was the author of "The Olive and the
Pine," a volume of poems published in 1859;
" Ivove in Spain, and Other Poems"; "The
Story of Chief Joseph"; "Bessie Gray"; Me-
moir of Charles Lowe; and a book of Easter
poems, called "The Innnortals."

The following notice of Martha Perry Lowe
is taken from an address by the Rev. William
H. Pierson, pastor of the Ihiitarian church in
Somerville: —

"Mrs. Lowe was a woman of delightful per-
sonal qualities. She had the advantages of
early culture and education. Her journey to
S])ain when she was a young girl to visit lier
brother, who was the Secretary of the Ahieri-
can Legation, and who married Carolina
Coronado, a Spanish poetess, lent a tinge
of romance and imagination to her mind,
which revealed itself afterward in many of the
poems she wrote about that fascinating but
mediiL'val country. But the basis of her mind
was sound common sen.se. ' ~

" She came here with lier young antl talented
husband somewhat more than forty years
since, to be the past(jr's wife in the First Con-
gregational (Uiutarian) Society of the town,
and from that time to this, in matters of edu-
cation and the schools, in matters of temper-
ance and reform, and in those that concern the
rights and suffrages of women, in matters which
related to the local Alliance, of which she was
president for many years, in the work of the
Unitarian Association, of which at one period
her husband was the able and efficient secre-
tary, and to whose interests she was ardently
devoted — in all these things by her written and
spoken words she was not only doing good to
the community, but she was building up a
character and influence of her own, the
recognition of which is to-day the sweetest
and most grateful tribute we can pay to her
memory.

"Mrs. Lowe was ever giving out, thinking,
writing, expressing her thought. She would
be inditing a poem, composing an article for the
Unitarian Revieip, the Chrititian Register, or
the local journal, making an address at the
Alliance, the Educational Union, the Woman's
Suffrage Club. In this way she kept herself
alive, alert, in touch with the great world and



428



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



its interests. In the old days of the Unitarian
Review many turned in every issue first of all
to the section headed 'At Homo and Abroad,'
articles which she wrote for that publication
for many years.

"Besides the good work that Mrs. Lowe did
and the influence she exerted, there was another
salient feature in her life that no one who had
any particular accpiaintance with her could fail
to recognize. That was the sweet remembrance
of her husband. Charles Lowe was the idol
of her heart. To lovingly write the story of
his life and work, to cherish his character and
memory, to live over again unceasingly the
hap])^ days and years in which they lived to-
gether for causes dear to humanity and God,
was her greatest joy and delight. ... A typi-
cal Unitarian, she loved the church of Chan-
ning. She was proud of its past, and had high
hopes for its future.

" Mrs. Lowe was one of the clearest and most
positive in her own expression of what she be-
lievetl to be true. Her whole life and character
was kindly, philanthropic, beneficent. Hhc
sought to be useful and to _ do good in the
world. Hence the large place and the wide
and long-sustained influence she has had in
this community."



SARAH ORNE JEWKTT, Litt.D.— An
assured position among American men
and women of letters has been won by
Sarah (^rne Jewett in her thirty and
more years of authorship, dating from her first
contribution to the Atlantic Monthly, December,
1869. Miss Jewett is a native of South Berwick,
Me. Born September 3, 1849, the second
daughter of Theodore H. Jewett, M.D., and his
wife Caroline, she still retains, with her sister
Mary, her home in the well-known "Jewett
House " at South Berwick, a comely and spacious
mansion built in 1740, now rich in historical
associations.

Miss Jewett is of iMiglish descent, traced
through long lines of American ancestry, with
a French strain inherited from her paternal
grandmother. Her maternal grandparents were
Dr. William and Abigail (Oilman) Perry, the
grandmother a daughter of Nathaniel Gilman



and descendant of Edward Gilman, one of the
earliest settlers of Exeter, N.H.

Dr. Theodore H. Jewett (Bowdoin College,
1834; Jefferson Medical College, 1840) was a
man of note in his profession, nuich trusted
and beloved as a family physician, and for some
years a professor in the Medical School con-
nected with Bowdoin College. Sarah, in her girl-
hood, not being strong and needing all the out-
door life possible, used often to accompany her
father during his long drives to visit his country
patients. Her reading and study received
most of its direction at home, though at in-
tervals she attendetl the South Berwick Acad-
emy.

While yet of school age, she wrote for Our
Young Folks and the Rivemide Magazine.
F'or a few years, as witnessed by the index to
the Atlantic Monllih/, 1857-76, she veiled her
identity as an author under the pen name of
Alice Eliot. " Deephaven," her first book,
published in 1877, has been followed by several
novels, as "A Country Doctor," "A Marsh
Island," and "The Tory Lover" (1901); a
number of volumes of short stories and sketches,
including (not to mention them all) "Country
Bv-ways," "Old Friends and New," "The Mate
of" the 'Daylight' and Friends Ashore," "The
King, of Folly Island and Other People," "A
White Heron and Other Stories"; three stories
for girls — namely, "Betty Leicester," "Betty
Leicester's Christmas," and "Playdays"; and
"The Story of the Normans," in Putnam's series
of Stories of the Nations.

From competent critics Miss Jcwett's writings
have received gracious meed of praise. In-
stance the following, which bears date 1897:
"As the best material for stories may be
wasted by unskilled hands, so the plain, the
meagre, the connnonplace, may be used to mar-
vellous advantage by the masters of the craft
Miss Jewett's 'Country of the Pointed Firs' is
a case in point. . . . The casual observer could
see little of interest here (in a fishing village
on the Maine coast), the average writer could
make little of what he sees, but the acute and
sympathetic; observer, the exceptional writer,
comes on the scene, looks about, thinks, writes,
and, behold! a fascinating story." Later work
in 1900 called forth this appreciation: "With-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



429



out falsifying cither inanimate or human nature,
she transmutes their ruggechiess into pure
gold, and arranges a harmony without one
jarring note."

The scene of "The Tory Lover," Miss Jewett's
latest work, is laid in the neighborhood of her
own town of South Berwick. The famous Paul
Jones is one of its personages, and other figures
are drawn with tlue regard to historic facts and
probabilities. The story is told with all the
grace and skill which characterize her literary
workmanship.

In 1901 Miss Jcwctt received from Bowdoin
College the degree of Doctor of Literature, she
being the first woman thus honored by that
institution.



MRS. L. E. ORTH was born in Mil-
ford, N.H., July 6, 1858. Her
father, James Blood, was descended
from Peter Blood, who was one of
the first settlers of Dunstable, Mass. Her
mother, Emeline AVheeler Blood, was the daugh-
ter of Major James Wheeler, of Hollis, N.H.,
whose ancestors were English, and his wife,
Dorcas Mooar, daughter of Jacob Mooar, wlio
was of Scottish descent.

In 1775 Jacob Mooar, Mrs. Orth's great-
grandfather, was sixteen years of age; and,
when the bell of the Hollis meeting-house was
rung to call the minute-men to arms, he was
hoeing in his grandfather Nevin's field, three
miles away. Hearing the bell, he dropped h's
hoe upon the nearest boulder, and ran to an-
swer the summons. The boulder upon which
his hoe rested was a few years ago removetl to
'the centre of Hollis, and now stands on the
green near the okl meeting-house fnjin whose
belfry the summons rang. Jacob Mooar fought
in the battle of Bennington.

Mrs. Emeline W. Blood was the leading so-
prano in the village choir, and always took a
prominent part in the local nmsical conven-
tions. The daughter, Lizzie, inherited musical
tendencies from her mother, and began the
study of the piano at the age of ten. Later,
when living in Springfield, Mass., she continued
her studies under Professor F. Zuchtmann, at
that time the foremost nmsician in Central



Massachusetts. Her musical talent showed
such promise that, urged by her advisers, she
planned t« go to Germany for study in June,
1877. On a visit to friends in Boston in Feb-
ruary of that year she met the pianist, John
Orth, who but two years before had returned
with much eclat from five years' study in Ger-
many with the foremost masters of that time —
Kullak, Liszt, Deppe, Lebert, and Pruckner —
in piano playing, and Kiel, Paisst, Weitzmann,
and P. Scharwenka in theory.

Coming to Boston to live in May, 1877, loi"
five years she studied the piano with Mr. Orth.
During the latter jjart of this period she taught
large classes of i)ui)ils, and made many success-
ful public appearances in concerts and recitals.
She also studied harmony with the late Charles
L. Capen.

In May, 1883, she was married to John Orth,
her teacher. One of the happiest experiences
of her wedding trip abroad was a stay of three
weeks in Weimar, made memorable by many
delightful afternoons in the salon of Liszt, who
with his wonderful and never to be forgotten
graciousness welcomed back his former pupil.
Here Mrs. Orth met many aspiring students
who have since become world famous, among
them Alexander Siloti, Alfretl Reisenauer, and
Arthur Friedheim. Arthur Bird, the American
com])oser, was one of the " Lisztianer." The
beautiful Mary F. Scott-Siddons, the English
actress, was of the coterie, with her son, Henry
A\'aller, the pianist. While in Stuttgart Mr.
and Mrs. Orth went with friends of the sculptor
Donsdorf to see his statue of Bach, just then
completed and ready to be taken to Eisenach,
the great master's birthplace, where in the
following year it was unveiled. The genial
sculptor later .sent to Mrs. Orth in Boston a
cast from the small model of the Bach statue,
dcnibtless the only one in this country. Dons-
dorf also sent a cast of his large medallion heail
of Robert Schumann, which forms part of the
pedestal of the Beethoven monument at Bonn.
At that time the sculptor had made but one
other cast, which he had presented to Madame
Clara Schumann.

From her marriage, in May, 1883, mitil May,
1895, Mrs. Orth's musical activity was confinecl
to teaching her own and other children. While

she had always extemporized on the piano with
freedom, she had never thought seriously of
composition; but in May, 1895, witlviut warn-
ing, forethought, or effort, the inner musical
life began to express itself in this form. At
first Mrs. Ojth's compositions were for the piano
alone, and were naturally the outcome of her
intimate knowledge of the musical needs of
children. To the writing of music for children
many seem to think themselves "called," but
indeed few are by nature chosen. Sucli nuisic
must^be naively simple, well defined in rhythm,
and as spontaneous as a child itself. To write
music of this type without triteness recjuires
nothing less than a rare sort of genius. Ac-
complished musicians, men famed for their work
in larger forms, have tried this and failed. In-
deed, it may be (|uestioned if any but a woman,
a mother full of the child spirit, can ade((uately,
lovingly, and sympathetically give musical ex-
pression to that which appeals to the child
heart. Mrs. Orth's work has clearly shown her
to be one of the chosen few.

Perhaps the most original of all piano works
for children is her "Mother Goose Songs with-
out Words," Op. 5. This volume contains
seventy little piano pieces in the exact rhythm
of the Mother Goose rhymes, which are printed
on the opposite pages, each number a tone
miniature, grave or gay, quiet or sparkling, ac-
cording to the story portrayed. The success
of this musical volume and her delight in writ-
ing it prompted Mrs. Orth later to the compo-
sition of "Mother Goose's Jubilee," an opera
for children, in three acts, which was performed
with the greatest success at the Tremont The-
atre, Boston, for a week in the spring of 1901.
In the opera the tribe of Mother Goose assem-
bles to celel)rate her jubilee. Tlie company is
received by Mother Goose and Jack, her son,
at her cottage in the wood, identified as the
House that Jack Built. The characters speak,
as they naturally would, the language of Mother
Goose, the entire libretto, a unique feature,
being based upon her rhymes and jingles. In
its published form this opera, her Opus 12, a
volume of sixty songs, is the largest collection of
its kind in print. To group togeiher sixty
short songs without suspicion of monotony is
in itself an achievement.



Mrs. Orth subsecjuently composetl the music
for a comic opera, entitled "The Song of the
Sea-shell," which ran for a week in one of the
Boston theatres in April, 1903. While so
much of Mrs. Orth's work has been devoted to
music for children, her Opus 25 and Opus 26
reveal her melodic gift in serioug songs of a
higher type. Among her other published com-
positions may be mentioned the following:
Op. 1, Four Character Sketches in F, for
piano; 0]). 2, Six Recreation Pieces, for piano;
Op. 6, "The Merry-go-round," eighteen piano
pieces; Op. 7, "Daffodils," three piano duets;
Op. 10, Ten Tone Pictures for the Piano; Op.
11, Twelve Miniatures for the Piano; Op. IS,
"On the White Keys," an introduction to tlie
])iano; Op. 19, Festival Minuet; Op. 21, "Ten
Little Fingers," ten piano pieces; Op. 23, "What
Little Hands can do," ten piano pieces; Op. 28,
Songs for Sleepy-time, twenty-four chiklren's
songs.



MARY A. LR'KRMORl'], LL.D., pub-
lic si)eaker and writer, during the
Civil War one of the foremost of
the Sanitary Commission workers,
and in these later years an able antl distinguislied
advocate of social reform, is a thorough New
I'jigland woman ])y birth and breeding, and
through six generalions of paternal ancestry.
Born in Boston on December 19, 1820, daughter
of Timothy and Zeliiah \'ose Glover (Ashton)
Rice, slie bore until marriage the name Mary
Ashton Rice. She was one of a family of six
children, only one of whom besides herself — a
sister Abby, Mrs. Coffin — attained adult age
and is now living. Her father served in the'
United States navy in the War of 1812. Her
mother was a daughter of Captain Nathaniel
Asliton, of London, England.

luhnuiid Rice, the founder of this branch of
the Rice fnmily in Massacluisetts, came from
Barkhamstead, Hertfordshire, England, in 1639,
and settled in Middlesex County, making his
liome at first in Sudbury, and removing thence
to Marlboro. He was known as "Goodman
Rice," and was a citizen of influence, being
appointed to solenmize marriages, a function
not entrusted, to the clergy in those days,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



431



serving several years as "Townsman," or
Selectman, and several years as Deputy to
the General Court. He was a Deacon of the
church.

From Goodman Rice the line to Timothy
Rice, father of Mary Ashton, was continued
through his son Thomas; his grandson Elisha,
who married r]lizabcth Wheeler, of Concord,
Mass.; their son Silas, who married Copia
Broughton; and Silas, Jr., who niarrietl Abigail
Hager, daughter of Benjamin and Abigail
(Warren) Hager ami a descendant of William
Hager and of John Warren, two early settlers
ami prominent citizens of Watertown, Mass.
Silas Rico, Jr., who lived for some years at
Northfield, Mass., was the father of Timothy,
whose home after marriage was in Boston..

Born with a love for books, possessed of a
"genius that would study," an energy that
knew no such word as fail, Mary Ashton Rice
was graduated at the Hancock School, Boston,
at the age of fourteen years and six months as-
a medal scholar, then to(jk a four years' course
in two years at a seminary for young ladies in
Charlestown, Miss Martha Whiting, principal,
and subsequently taught* Latin and French
there for two years, at the same time continuing
her own more advanced stuilics. Her ne.xt ex-
perience was of three years as teacher in a
planter's family in Southern Mrginia. She re-
turned to Boston a confirmed abolitionist and
champion of human rights. The three years
following saw her at the head of a school of
her own fo'r ailvanced pupils in Duxbury, an
experiment, and a successful one, in co-educa-
tion. Then came a turning-point in her course.
She was marri'ed in 1845 to the Rev. Daniel
Parker Livermore, an earnest, persuasive
preacher of the Universalist faith, a man who
did not ask or e.xpect her to become anything
less than an equal partner in life's faring. As
the wife of a settled minister, for the first
. twelve years of their marrietl life Mrs. Livermore
found abundant opportunity for the use of her
varied talents. With a keen sense of the needs
of the young people of the parish and warm
sympathy for their aspirations, she formed
circles for reading and study, and continued
the literary work which she had begun some
time before, contributing stories, sketches, and



poems to the Ladies' Repository, the Neic York
Tribune, and other publications, frecjuently
lending her pen to the temperance ci.use.
Children came to brighten the home life, wliich
was a happy though a busy ami strenuous one,
and not exempt from the cares and sorrows of
sickmss and bereavement.

In 1S57 Mr. and Mrs. Livermore, with their
two daughteis, lemoved to Chicago, where for
a number of yeais Mr. Livcimore edited and
published a religious paper. Mrs. Livermore,
as a co-worker, often duiing his absence on
a missionary trip had sole charge of the paper,
printing-office, and its concerns. She wrote
much for tiie paper on every tojMc except
theology, and was also a writer for Eastern
papers, their well-kept home, in the meantime,
being the centre of far-reaching, generous hos-
pitality. Her practical energy made itself felt
in philantinopic work, such as the establish-
ment of the Home for Aged Women, the Hos-
pital for Women and Children in Chicago, and
the Home of the Friendless.

When the war of the Rebellion came, with
its pressing needs — suffering, hunger, and desti-
tution — Mrs. Livermore, having always been
at work, was reatly with well-developetl forces,
powers keen and alert, for new service. This
she rendered as an associate member of the
I'nited States Sanitary Commission with her
friend, Mrs. Hoge, their headquarters being in
Chicago. She organized soldiers' aid societies,
planned sanitary fairs, conducted an endless
correspomlence, went to the front to distribute
supplies, tletailed army nurses. These and
many similar deeds of mercy were crowded into
those years of strife. Pleading for money to
meet the wants of sick, wounded, and dying sol-
diers, Mrs. Livermore revealed a gift of elo-
tjuence of whose possession she was ignorant,
and became an effective puljlic speaker years
before she would achiiit the fact.

When the war was ended, she returned to her
literary and philanthropic activities in Chicago,
using her pen as before to advocate the higher
education of women and their entrance into the
professions and wider industrial fields, and also
urging the repeal of unjust laws, which had
hindered their progress. Joining the ranks of
the woman suffragists, with these ends in view.



432



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



she took the lead in making arrangements for
a woman's suffrage convention in Chicago,
which was in 1S6(S; and when the Illinois
Women's Suffrage Association was organized
she was elected its president. To further pro-
mote the interests of the great reform move-
ments, suffrage and temperance, she started
in .January, 1869, a weekly paper called the
Agitator, which she conducted successfully for
a year in Chicago. Then it was merged in the
Woman's Journal, established in Boston in
Jaunary, 1870, by a joint stock company, antl
she was made its editor-in-chief. The Liver-
more family then returned to Massachusetts,
and have since resided in Melrose. For two
years Mrs. Livermore edited the Woman's
Journal, and then resigned that position and
all other work, to devote herself to the lecture
field, which has witnessed her severest toil as
well as her most signal triumphs. For nearly
thirty years she has spoken from platform and
pulpit on a variety of topics, religious, reforma-
tory, sociological, historical, and ethical, and
has lectured in nearly every State of the Union,
and also in England and Scotland. In these
later years her itinerary extends not far from
the home fireside. Still, wherever she speaks,
whether as presiding officer of a memorial
meeting, where a tender tribute is paid to the
gracious memory of a departed leader, or at
a biweekly meeting of the Massachusetts Suf-
frage Association, of which she is president, or
to voice a need of the hour, people crowd to
hear, and are moved by the old-time fluent
force and earnestness, the vivid expression of
her powerful personality, which every good
cause is sure to arouse.

Mrs. Livermore has written all her life for
the magazines of the day, the New York Trib-
une, Ladies' Repository, Youth's Companion,
North American Revicir, Inclejiendent, Chavtaii-
quan, Arena, and other periodicals. Among the
books which she has published are: "What
shall we do with our Daughters?" "Thirty
Years too Late" (illustrative of the Wasliing-
tonian reform), "My Story of the War" (of
which nearly a himdred thousand copies were
sold), and her Autobiography.

She has recently passed through the great
sorrow of her life, in the death of her husband,



with whom she hatl been unitetl in marriage
fifty-four years.

The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was
conferred on Mrs. Livermore in 1896 by Tufts
College. She was for ten years president of
the Massachusetts W. C. T. U.; has been presi-
tlent of the American \A'oman's Suffrage As.so-
ciation; president of the Association for the
Atlvancement of Women; is president of the
Massachusetts W' Oman's Suffrage Association;
president of the Beneficent Society of the New
England Conservatory of Music; is a life mem-
ber of the Women's Educational and Industrial
Union, of Boston; a member of the Massachu-
setts Indian Association, the Woman's Relief
Corps, the Massachusetts Woman's Prison As-
sociation, and other societies, and of various
literary clubs. She is jiractically a Unitarian
in religion, holding to a creedless Christianity
that shows itself in love and work, and trusting
ever in the Eternal Goodness that rules both
this life and that which is to come, of which
this is the beginning.



ANNA M. LELAND BAILEY, ex-Regent
/\ of Paul Revere Chapter, D. A. R.,
j[_ j^ of Boston, and President of the West
Newton Women's Educational Club
(1903), was born in Somerville, Mass., a
daughter of John Murray Leland and his
wife, Sophronia Page Savage. The Lelands
were among the pioneer families of Middlesex
County, Hemy Leland, from whom John Mur-
ray Leland was a descendant in the seventh
generation, becoming an inhabitant of Med-
field in 1652, his home being in that part of
the town which in 1674 was incorijorated as
Sherborn. Isaac Leland, a great-grandson of
Henry and great-grandfather of John Murray
Leland, removed about th(&gt; year 1774 from
Massachusetts to Rintlge, N.H. , He was a soldier
of the Revolution, being a private in Captain •
Philip Thomas's company in 1775, and in
1777 a private in Captain Samuel Blodgett's
company, "raised by the State of New Hamp-
shire for the Continental service."

He died in the army, September 3, 1777.

John Murray Leland was a highly respected
citizen of Somerville for more than fifty years.
His wife Sophronia was of Maine ancestry.
They had five chiUh'en, namely: Albert A.;
Arabella, who died in infancy; Anna M. (now
Mrs. Bailey); EllaF.: and Frank E.

Anna M. Leland was educated in the public
schools of Somerville, and graduated from the
Somerville High School, being one of the first
girls to take the full classical, or college pre-
paratory course of stuily in that school. Liv-
ing within sight of Harvard College, it was but
natural that she should incline toward a col-
lege education; but fate beckoned in another
direction, and she was induced to accept the
position of teacher in the public schools of her
native city, soon becoming the principal of
the Jackson School. She afterward hail a
position in the Harvard Grammar School in
Cambridge, which she held until lier marriage.
She was very successful as a teacher, her great
love for children, her sympathy with their
needs, and her enthusiasm for her cho.sen work
endearing her to parents and pupils alike.

In addition to her regular work she con-
tinued her studies, forming classes at ilifferent
times in French, German, art, literature, elo-
cution, antl physical culture, before the days
of women's clubs, and spending her vacations
in travel. With a cultivated musical taste,
she was for several years a pupil of the New
England Conservatory of Music, and has been
a member of various musical organizations,
among them the Handel and Haytln, the Som-
erville Musical Association, and the Newton
Choral Association, which she was largely
instrumental in organizing.

She was married February 14, 1884, to Alvin
Richarils Bailey, a graduate of the Somerville
High School and for many years president of
the alumni of that school. Mr. Bailey is one
of the intelligent and prosperous business men
of Boston. His father, Joshua S. Bailey, was
one of the first to ship crackers all over the
world.

Since her marriage Mrs. Bailey has made
her home in Newton. She is a member of
the Channing Religious Society, has been a
teacher in the Sunday-school for many years,
assisting her husband in his duties as super-



intendent, serving also as president of the
Ladies' Society and chairman of the Hospital-
ity Committee. She is vice-president of the
Social Science Club of Newton, Secretary of
the Newton Fetleration of Women's Clubs, and
the Shattuck Club of Boston, and has been
a member of the West Newton Women's Edu-
cational Club for sixteen years, serving most
of that time as director, recording secretary,
and now (1903) as president. vVmid these many
and varied interests she has not been found
wanting in patriotism, being a member of the
Sarah Hull Chapter, D. R., of Newton, and
of the National Society, D. A. R., and at pres-
ent Regent of the Paul Revere Chapter, D. A. R.,
of Boston. These honors and many others
with which her friends have testified to their
high regard for her are doubly valued since
they came unsought. That they are merited,
no one will deny.

Her bright and cordial manner and her sym-
pathetic nature have been powerful factors
in the deserved success which she has achieved,
and have helped to cheer and uplift those
who have come within the influence of her
personality.



MARION HOWARD BRAZIER, jour-
nalist, of Boston, is the daughter
of the late William Henry Braziery
a veteran of the Civil War and mem-
ber of the Grand Army of the Republic. Ac-
cording to family tradition Mr. Brazier was
descended from Sir Henry Brazier, who lived
many years ago in Lincolnshire, England.

The maiden name of Miss Brazier's mother
was Sarah Jane Sargent. She was daughter
of David Sargent (the fourth of that name in
direct line) and his wife, Elizabeth I. Fille-
brown, and was a descendant in the ninth gen-
eration of William Sargent, of Maiden, Mass.,
who came from Northampton, England, in
1638. William is said to have been son of
Roger and grandson of Hugh Sargent, of North-
amptonshire, . England.

Two of Miss Brazier's ancestors on the ma-
tei-nal side — namely, David Sargent and Abra-
ham Rand — were soUliers of the Revolution,
the last named serving three years in the army.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



His mother, Anne Devens, wife of Thomas
Rand, was "probably daughter of Philip
Devens" and nearly related to the family to
which Judge Devens belonged.

Another patriotic ancestor, John Hicks, of
Cambridge, was slain by the British in the
retreat from Lexington, April 19, 1775. The
Hon. Charles Saunders, former Mayor of Cam-
bridge, first president of the Sons of the Amer-
ican Revolution, is also a descendant of John
Hicks and second cousin to Miss Brazier.

Marion H. Brazier was born in Charlestown
on the day that California was made a State,
and was graduated from the Bunker Hill
Gra,nmiar School at the close of the Civil War.
This completed her schooling, but not her
education, which has come through her c^)n-
tact with the world, her ambition leading her
to associate with her superiors in intellect, to
keej) up to date, and never to look back. After
Miss Brazier had filled positions of trust as
accountant and cashier for a number of years,
her health became so seriously impaired as to
demand a change " of scene and occupation.
She crossed the continent in ISSS, and while
in Santa Fe a sudden inspiration came to her
to write of the scenes in that picturescjue city.
Thus it happened that, in the room where
General Lew Wallace had written "lien-Hur,"
Miss Brazier wrote her first article for pulili-
cation. While in California her pen was kept
busy in supplying the local and New England
papers with breezy specials on many topics.
She was for a long time society and club edi-
tor of the Boston Sunday Poxt, regular con-
tributor to the Boston Transcript, editor of a
New York society magazine, and space writer
for innumerable news)«ipers. She is a jour-
nalist of the widp-awake type, and has been the
biographer of many noted people.

Her writing has been largely devoted to pa-
triotic matters. The I'nlriotic Review, founded,
edited, and published by Miss Brazier, is a fine
example of historical literature. It has a good
circulation and a host of appreciative readers.

Mi.ss Brazier is at present (1904) society
editor of the Boston .Journal and a regular con-
tributor to the Sunday Hirald and the Globe.
She holds membershi]) in ihv following organ-
izations: New England Woman's Press Asso-



ciation; Charity Club; Actors' Church Alliance;
Daughters of Veterans; U. S. W. V. Auxiliary;
Daughters of New Hampshire and of Massa-
chusetts; Woman's Club House Corporation;
and in the National Society, D. A. R., in which
she has founded two chapters — Bunker Hill
and Paul Jones. Thnnigh her efforts the naval
hero of the American Revolution is honored in
Ma.ssachu.setts, and a handsome schoolhouse
bears his name in East Boston.



ELIZA ANN BRADBURY was born in
Augusta, Me., March 18, 1815. Her
father, Thomas Westbrook Smith, was
born in Dover, N.H., in 1785. He was
a grandson of Thomas Westbrook Waldron
and a great -great-grandson of Colonel Richard
Waldron, who came to New Hampshire from
ICngland in 1635, and who was killed by Indians
at his garrison in Dover in 1689. The Wal-
drons were among the oldest inhabitants of
Dover, and bore prominent part in its earl}'
history.

Thomas Westbrook Smith came to Augusta
in 1S()5, and for fifty years was one of the lead-
ing business men of that city. He died in
March, 1855. His wife was Abigail Page.
They had one son, Henry R. Smith. Their
j'oungest child, Elizabeth Westbrook, died in
infancy. Kliza Ann, the only surviving daugh-
ter, was married November 25, 1834, before
she was twenty years of age, to the Hon. James
AVare Bradltury, who was twelve years her
senior. For a long period Mr. Bradbury was
one of the leading members of the Kennebec
County bar. I'^lected United States Senator
in 1846, he ser\(&gt;(l in Congress through the term
ending March 4, 1853. Two of the four sons
born to Mr. and Mrs. Bradbury died liefore
th(nr mother, an affliction from which she never
&lt;(uite rallied. Mrs. Bradbury died January
29, 1879. Her memory was always very pre-
cious to her husband. Nothing seemed to
please him more than to have a sympathetic
listener while he recounted tlie many pleasant
reminiscences of his happy married life. The
anniversary evenings of their marriage were
always sacred to him. He would watch the
clock (which had stood in the corner of the



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



435



library for more than sixty years) and tell
those who were gathered aronnd him the exact
moment when the ceremony began. The mem-
ory of his wife seemed to keep Mr. Bradbury
bright for the more than score of years that he
survived her. "To live in the hearts we leave
behind is not to die." He -died January 6,
1901, full of years and full of honors. He was
born June 10, 1802.

Mr. Bradbury, like a wise man, always de-
ferred to his wife in hou.?ehokl matters, saying:
"It relieves me of great responsibility. My
wife is more fitted than I am for it." And cer-
tainly Mrs. Bradbury had great business ca-
pacity, possessing unconunon executive abil-
ity, which she inherited from her father, a man
of strong will, great industry, sterling sense,
and correct judgment. She inherited much
property from her father and from her only
brother (Henry R. Smith, who died in March,
1876); and, being always self-reliant, she en-
joyed the management of it. Sympathetic
and full of energy, she was active in works of
benevolence, and had great tact and power
in bringing others to co-operate in carrying
them forward. Much of her income was used
in alleviating the sufferings of the poor and
needy, who found in her a warm friend. One
of her favorite charities was the Old Ladies'
Home of Augvista, of which at the tinie of her
death she wa3»-president. Many gifts from
other hands were the result of her persuasive
efforts. In her will she left to this home a
generous bequest and also one to the (ieneral
Hospital at Portland for a free bed, also dona-
tions to the Howard Benevolent Society" and
the Episcopal (kiild of Augusta.

Mrs. Bradbury always enjoyed society, and
with her husband helil m^iy pleasant recep-
tions at their home. During Mr. Bradbury's
senatorship she always accom{)anietl him to
Washington, where she derived nuicli satis-
faction from her increased social activities.

For many years she was a member of the
Congregational church, but during the last few
years of her life she attended the Episcopal
church. A writer saitl of her, " Her creed was
much broader than that of any denomination.
She observed strictly the Golden Rule, and hers
were the charities that soothe and heal and



bless. The epitaph on her tombstone is truly
expressive of her character: 'She loved to do
good.'"



DORCAS HARVEY LYMAN, Past De-
partment President of the Wonum's
Relief Corjjs of Massachusetts, has
resided within the present limits of
the city of Boston the past forty-six years.
Born in 1845 in Liverpool, N.S., she came to
Boston in childhood with her parents, and
received her education in its public schools.
She is a daughter of the late John W. and
Susan F. (Jones) Harvey, natives of Liver-
pool, N.S.

Her father was born July 9, 1812. He mar-
ried May 24, 1842, Susan F. Jones, who was
born Marcli 7, 1821. In 1868 they settled
in Brighton, Mass. Mr. Harvey tUed October
16, 1886, and his wife died December 30, 1900.
Mrs. Harvey was a member of the Second
Congregational C'hurch of Brighton and of the
Relief Corps auxiliary to Francis Washburn
Post, No. 92, G. A. R. She was identified
with the woman suffrage cause, and was the
oldest woman voter for school connnittee
in Brighton. The Woma7i's Journal, referring
to her death, said: "The community has lost
one of its most respected and beloved residents.
Mrs. Harvey's illness covered a period of about
nine weeks, during which time she did not lose,
through her suffering, any of the deep and lov-
ing interest which she had always taken in the
lives of her children, friends, or the outside
workl in general. She was a woman of deep
and unquestioning faith, who led a broad and
Christian life, of which her children and grand-
children may well be proud. She shed about
her an influence of unselfishness and piety
which will bear fruit in the years to come.
The Rev. A. A. Berle, D.D., who conducted
the services at her funeral, spoke of the old-
time belief and trust which characterized her
life and of her deep anil earnest patriotism."

Mr. and Mrs. Harvey had four children, three
sons and one daughter, named above. The
eldest child, James W., was a soldier of the
Civil War. Enlisting August 5, 1862, in the
Eleventh Massachusetts Battery, he served until

May 29, 1863, when his term of enhstinent
expired. From 1863 to 1867 he was Adjutant
of the Boston Light Infantry. He married
Emma C. Cunningham, of Brooklyn, N.Y.,
June 18, 1866, ancl settled in Faneuil, Mass.
In 1877, aided by the Rev. H. A. Stevens, at
that time jiastor of tlie Congregational church,
Brighton, he founded a Sunday-school at Fan-
euil. It proved a success, and a chapel was
erected in 1900. James Harvey was also inter-
ested in the public schools and in the election
of worthy members to the school board. He
was president of the Eleventh Battery Asso-
ciation, chairman of the Rei)ublican Ward
Connnittee for eleven years, and member of
the Massachusetts House of Representatives
1889-92. At the time of his death, which
occurred August 6, 1897, he was Commander
of Francis Washburn Post, No. 92, G. A. R.,
of Brighton. He was an eloquent speaker
and a recognized leader in the church and in
societies. He conducted an extensive business
on Atlantic Avenue, Boston, and was an ex-
pert in steel workings.

Dorcas Harvey, the only daughter of her
parents, was married August 9, 1870, to Will-
iam Henry Lyman, of Brighton. Mr. Lyman
served throughout the Civil War in Company
H, Sixteenth Mas.sachusetts Volunteers. He
is a member of Francis Washburn Post, No. 92,
G. A. R., of Brighton.

Mrs. Lyman is interested not only in patri-
otic work, but in many other leading move-
ments of the day. She is a member of the
Congregational church, Brighton, and has been
actively associated with its missionary enter-
prises. The beautiful chapel in Faneuil, ded-
icated in 1900 through the efforts of her brother
antl others, received her active support, and she
was a substitute teacher in its Sunday-school.

She is an active member of the King's Daugh-
ters, also of the W'oman's Christian Temper-
ance Union, and a worker in the Brighton
and AUston \\'oman Suffrage League. For the
past ten years she has served as chairman of
the Connnittee of Independent Women Voters
of Ward 25, Boston, a position requiring a
knowledge of political conditions, (juick dis-
cernment, and executive ability. The most
prominent citizens of the Bhgiiton district



recognize Mrs. Lyman's efficiency, and candi-
dates favoring honest government and reform
measures have often owed their election largely
to her su])port.

Mrs. Lyman united with Francis Washburn
Relief Corps, No. 79, Brighton, in 1887, and,
after filling every other office in the corps,
was elected president three successive years —
1892, 1893, 1894. She was a Department
Aide in 1893, 1894, and 1899 and a National
Aide in 1895, 1898, and 1902. She has served
as a delegate in National Conventions every
year but one since 1887. As a member of
the Department Relief and other important
committees, she has rendered invaluable ser-
vice. In 1897 she sent twenty-five dollars
to the Ander.sonville Prison Board of the Na-
tional W. R. C, and was the first contributor
to the fund for preserving that historic ground
as a permanent memorial.

Mrs. Lyman was specially active in the emer-
gency work for the boys of the S]&gt;anish- Ameri-
can War, and through the entire sununer of
1898 was on duty as one of the Connnittee of
the Volunteer Aid Association. She solicited
money and needful articles for the soldiers
at the front, packed supplies for the hospital
ship (the "Bay State"), and, when the regi-
ments returned from Cuba, visited every week
for several months the soldiers in the hos])itals
in Boston. She has also secured contributions
for the troops in the Phili])i)ines.

After serving as a member of the Dejiart-
ment Executive Board several years (one year
as chairman), she was elected Department
Junior Vice-President at the annual State
convention held in Boston in 1900. A brill-
iant reception was tendered her by Corps No.
79 and Post No. 92 of Brighton. Previous to
her election Post No. 92, of Brighton, hail is-
sued a hearty endorsement of her candidacy,
saying: "We of this post know Mrs. Lyman's
worth, her love for the veterans, her intense
loyalty to the nation, her tireless and inde-
fatigable energy and labor for the Grand Army
of tiie Republic as well as for the Relief Corps.
Early ami late, in sunshine antl storm, she has
laboretl for their interests as much, we be-
lieve, as any woman in the department has for
a post to which a corps is auxiliary."

Mrs. Lyman has given her best efforts for
Post No. 92, assisting in fairs and in other en-
terprises. On one occasion she presented the
post a handsome china set of seven hundred
and fifty pieces and an autograph quilt contain-
ing four hunched and sixty-eiglit names,
among them those of President Harrison,
ex- President Cleveland, prominent military
heroes, Boston merchants, and all members
of Post No. 92.

During her year as Department Junior
Vice-President, Mrs. Lyman attended numer-
ous patriotic gatherings, participating in corps
meetings, union services with posts, socials,
and campfires. She also served on commit-
tees, and was vice-chairman of the Department
W. R. C. table in the fair of the Ladies' Aid
A.ssociation of the Soldiers' Home which was
held in Faneuil Hall.

At the annual convention in 1901 Mrs.
Lyman was unanimously elected Department
Senior Vice-President. As reported at the
annual convention in 1902, held in the Park
Street Church, Boston, she visited sixty-six
corps and participated in over one hundred
patriotic gatherings in her official capacity
during the year. She was also vice-president
of the Department W. R. C. Fair Committee
for the week's fair held in November, 1901,
in Faneuil Hall, Boston.

At the last annual convention, February 12,
1902, which was composed of delegates repre-
senting fourteen thousand women, Mrs. Lyman
was unanimously elected to the office of Depart-
ment President. She conducted a very suc-
cessful administration, and was popular with
the posts and corps throughout the State. She
represented the Department on two hundred
and seventy-eight different occasions, and
travelled many thousands of miles. Special
efforts were made by her to increase the relief
fund, and she was successful in this, as in all
her work for the cause.

She was the recipient of many courtesies
throughout the State and at Washington, D.C.,
where she attended the National Convention,
and had charge of the delegation from Maaea-
chusetts.

She is an earnest worker in all the lines of
patriotism and active in the plans for the



National Convention to be held in Boston in
1904, being a member of the Executive Com-
mittee and chairman of the Committee on
Luncheon. In everything she undertakes Mrs.
Lyman enters upon the work in a zealous man-
ner, and has accomplished results that have
won for her the respect and commemlation of
her associates.



MARIE WARE LAUGHTON was born
in Lewiston, Me., at the home of
her parents, Warren Preston and
Elizabeth Foss (Prentiss) Laugh ton.
Her paternal grandparents were John and
Amata (Greenleaf) Laughton. Another John
Laughton, her ancestor of an earlier genera-
tion, was a minute-man in the Revolution.
Through her grandmother Amata, daughter of
Joshua Greenleaf, Miss Laughton traces her
ancestry back to Edmund Greenleaf (believed to
have been of Huguenot stock), who settled
in Newbury, Mass., in 1635. Her line, like
the poet John Greenleaf Whittier's, continued
through Etlmund's son Stephen, who married
Elizabeth, daughter of Tristram Coffin.

Miss Laughton's maternal grandparents were
Philo and Matilda (Foss) Prentiss. Her great-
grandfather, Valentine Prentiss, served as
Sergeant in the Revolutionary army. After
the war he removed from Woodbury, Conn.,
to China, Me. He was a lineal descendant of
Valentine Prentise, who joined the church in
Roxbury in 1632.

Marie Ware Laughton, after her graduation
from the Lewiston High School, attended
the Normal Practice School in that city, from
which she received her teacher'.? diploma in
1881. She then taught for six years in the
Lewiston public schools. During the latter
part of this time she took up the study of elo-
cution. In the following year she was granted
leave of absence to attend tlie Boston School
of Oratory, where she was graduated in 1888.
She has studied extensively with the best spe-
cialists in the country.

After continuing her work of teaching in
Maine for several years, she came to Boston
to teach in the Boston College of Oratory, and
in 1896 she fomided the School of English

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Speech and Expression, of which she is prin-
cipal. The aim of this school is to give in-
struction in higher English and in the art of
expression. Its marked success proves that
public speakers, readers, and teachers of read-'
ing and elocution in public schools and col-
leges appreciate a school conducted by teachers
who present sound methods. The school also
meets the need of many who have no thought
of entering a profession, but who realize the
value of training for the development of power
and for the opening up of new and enduring
fields of culture.

Miss Laughton has been identified with sev-
eral clubs and with the Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution, being the first woman in
Massachusetts to hold the office of State Vice-
Regent of the Society. She is the founder and
is now Regent of the Committee of Safety
Chapter, D. A. R., of Boston.



EDNA DEAN PROCTOR.— It is an in-
teresting question how far early envi-
ronments of place and scene affect gift
and character; but with a sympathetic,
receptive, aesthetic nature, and surroundings
of unusual individuality and beauty, there can
be no doubt of their vivid impression and
moulding force.

Edna Dean Proctor is of unmixed English
ancestry. Her father, John Proctor, a na-
tive of Manchester, Mass. (Manchester-by-the-
Sea), was a descendant of John Proctor of
England, who came to Ipswich, Mass., in 1635,
and whoso eldest son, John Proctor, of Salem
Village, was one of the victims in August, 1692,
of the Salem witchcraft delusion. The Good-
hues, the Cogswells, the Appletons, the Choates,
of Essex County, were allied with this family.
Her mother, Lucinda Gould, of Henniker, N.H.,
represented the Goulds who had come from
Massachusetts to the newer settlement and
the Prescotts and Hiltons of Hampton and
Exeter, N.H. The Proctor family removed from
Manchester-by-the-Sea to Henniker, and chose
their home u})on a hill overlooking the Con-
toocook valley, the "pine-crowned hill" of her
poem, "Contoocook River." The wide horizon
of this noble elevation, her birthplace and early



home — embracing Kearsarge, Monadnock, and
the outlying ranges of the White Hills — the
broad forests, and the beautiful stream flowing
through the meadows, made a grand and pictu-
resque landscape, which is reflected again and
again in her poems, and which may have been
an inspiration to high themes.

With the exception of le.ss than a year at
Mount Holyoke Seminary, her schools were
those of her native village and of Concord,
N.H. ; but she has often said that her best edu-
cation was had in reaiiing with her mother.
Several years of teaching in New Haven, Conn.,
and Brooklyn, N.Y., followed. In the latter
city she made a collection of extracts from the
sermons of the Rev. Henry Ward Beechei — a
book entitled "Life Thoughts" — which was
very popular at home and abroad. Meanwhile
she was deeply interested, as she has always
been, in national affairs. Upon the day of
John Brown's execution her poem, "The Vir-
ginia Scaffold," was read at a large meeting in
New York City, and its prophecy in the stanza:

" They may hang him on the gibbet; tliey may raise

the victor's cry
AVlien they see him darkly swinging lilce a speck

against the sky;
Ah I the (lying of a hero that the right may win its

way
Is but sowing seed for harvest in a warm and mellow

May!
Now his story shall be whispered by the firelight's

evening glow,
And in fields of rice and cotton when the hot noon

passe.i slow,
Till his name shall be a watchword from Missouri to

the sea,
And his planting find its reaping in the Birthday of

the Free I "

has been amply fulfilled. During the war her
poems, "Who's Ready?" "Heroes," "The
Mississippi," and others, were marked and in-
fluential. Her first small volume of verse
was published by Hurd &amp; Houghton in 1867.
Then came some two years of foreign travel,
an outcome of which was "A Russian Journey."
Of this book Whittier wrote: "I like it better
than ' Eothen.' " Its chapter upon Sebastopol is
said to have caused the neglected English ceme-
teries there to be cared for as their brave dead
deserved. Upon the completion of the railway

to the Pacific, in 1S69, Miss Proctor went with
friemls to California, and her letters, "From
the Narrows to the Golden Gate," in the Neiv
York Independent, were pronounced by many
the best account of the continental journey.
A second ' collection of her poems was pub-
lished by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. in 1890,
and two years later the same house issued her
"Song of the Ancient People," which was in-
spired by the "Hemenway Southwestern Ex-
pedition." In the Columbian year of 1892 she
wrote the poem, "Columbia's Banner," which
was read and recited throughout the schools of
the country on Columbus Day; and in Septem-
ber of that year her song, "Columbia's Em-
blem," celebrating the maize as our national
fioral emblem, appeared in the Century Maga-
zine. This .song has been widely read and sung.
As a reviewer said of it, "It has gone straight
to the heart of the American people, ... a song
which will be more potent than law to give
the Intlian corn its representative place in the
republic." Most of the year 1897 she spent in
Mexico afld South America. In 1899 she wrote
the poem, "The Hills are Home," for the first
Olil Home Week in New Hampshire, and in 1900
published her New Hampshire verse in a vol-
ume entitled "The Mountain Maid."

Mi.ss Proctor's poetry is characterized by
strength and fervor, by lofty thought and
melodious numbers. Though so patriotic an
American, her sympathies enable her to under-
stand the heart of other races. No truer ex-
])ression of the feeling of a devout, orthodox
Russian has been given than her poem " Holy
Russia," which Longfellow regrettetl was not
written early enough to be included in his
"Russia" ("Poems of Places"), saying, "It
would have been a splendid prelude to the
volume." Of her "El Mahdi to the Tribes
of the Soudan" the late Professor Frederick
W. H. Myers, of Cambridge, England, said, "It
is .so Oriental I can hartUy believe it was writ-
ten by any one in the AVestern worUl"; and the
late James Darmesteter, professor in the College
of France, wrote her from Constantinople, ask-
ing to include it in a new edition of his
brochure of 1885, " The Mahdi." Her " Song of
the Ancient People" — the Pueblos of our South-
west— has the dignity and pathos of a race



that beholds all it revered and cherished slip-
ping away. The late John Fiske, in his preface
to the "Song," says of it: " As a rendering of
Moqui-Zuni thought, it is a contribution of
great and permanent value to American litera-
ture." Yet her sympathies are not alone for
matters of race and nation, but are warm and
loyal in home and social life, and all express the
power and charm of her personality. Appended
are two of her poems.

MOXADNOCK IN OCTOBER.

Uprose Monadiiock in tlie northern blue,

A glorious minster buUdcd to the Lord!

The setting sun his crimson radiance threw

On crest, and steep, and wood, and valley sward,

Blending tlieir myriad hues in rich accord,

Till, like the wall of heaven, it towered to view.

Along its slope, where russet ferns were strewn

And purple heaths, the scarlet maples flamed,

And reddening oaks and golden birches shone —

Resplendent oriels in the black pines framed,

The pines that climb to woo the winds alone.

And down its cloisters blew the evening breeze,

Through courts and aisles ablaze with autumn bloom.

Till shrine and portal thrilled to harmonies

Now soaring, dying now in glade and gloom.

And with the wind was heard the voice of streams —

Constant their Aves and Te Deums be —

Lone Ashuelot nuirmuring down the lea,

And brooks that haste where shy Contoocook gleams

Through groves and mead&lt;^ws, broadening to the sea.

Then lioly twilight fell on earth and air;

Above the dome the stars hung faint and fair.

And the vast minster hushed its shrines in prayer;

While all the lesser heights kejit watch and ward

About Mouaduock, builded to the Lord!

BORN OF THE SPIRIT.

She called me a moment before,
And smiled, as I entered the door,

In her gentle way ;
A sigh, a droop of the head,
And something forever had fled.

And she was but clay !

Her hand was yet clasped in mine,
And bright, in the golden shine.

Her brown hair fell ;
But the marble Psyche there
As soon would have heard my prayer,

My wild farewell.

'Twas the hush of an autumn noon,
So clear that the waning moon
Was a ghost in the skj- ;

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Not a leaf on tlie lindens swayed,
And even the brook in the glade
Han, noiseless, by.

\l'/i(if had gone from the room,
Leaving the sunshine gloom,

The soft air chill?
If the tiniest bird bad llown,
Its flight had a shadow thrown

On lawn and rill.

But neither a sound nor sight
Disturbed the calm or the light

Of the noontide air ;
Yet the friend I loved was as far
As a ghostly moon or star

From my call and care.

Dead, with her hand in mine!
Dead, in the golden shine

Of the autumn day!
Dead, and no note in heaven
Nor a gleam of white wings given

To mark her wayl

And my heart went up in the cry,
'' How did the swift soul fly ?

What life inherit?"
Then the wind blew sweet and was gone,
And a voice said, " .So is one

Born of the Spirit.''''



DEBORAH NICHOLS MORTON, Pre-
ceptress of Westbrook Seminary, Port-
land, Me., was born in the town of
Bristol, on the coast, in 1857. The
daughter of Leander and Deborah Rogers
(Nichols) Morton, she is a descendant on her
father's side of Captain James Morton, of
Muscongus, who is mentioned in the History
of Bristol and Bremen, Me., as one who took
part in the expedition against Quebec under
General Wolfe in September, 1759, he being
employed as pilot on a transport.

On her mother's side Miss Morton is de-
scended from Lieutenant Alexander Nickels,
who commanded Fort Frederick at Pemaquid
in 1756, and some time later was known a-s Cap-
tain Nickels. He is said to have come to New
England with his wife and children from Lon-
donderry, Ireland, in 1721. In his will, dated in
January, 1758, and proved on October 2, 1758,
he "calls himself Alexander Nickels, of New-
castle in the county of York, gentleman.

Miss Morton's paternal grandparents were



John Morton and his wife, Anna Bryant, the
former son of James Morton above mentioned,
and the latter belonging to the Scituate family
of Bryants.

Thomas and Deborah (Rogers) Nichols,
Miss Morton's maternal grandparents, were
persons of importance in the town of Bristol,
where they lived. They were married in 1813.
Their daughter, Deborah R. (Mrs. Morton),
named for her mother and grandmother, was
born in 1822. Thomas Nichols was a son of
James Nichols l^y his wife, Deborah Bradford,
who.se name is .suggestive of early colonial
ancestry, but whose lineage has not been
traced.

Miss Morton's father, Leander Morton, born
in Bristol in 1814, was a public-spirited man,
active in the religious, social, and political affairs
of the community. Her mother, Mrs. Deborah
R. Nichols Morton, born in 1822, was a woman
of strong and beneficent influence.

Mi.ss Morton was graduated from W^estl)rook
Seminary, Dr. James P. Weston principal
(now deceased), in 1879. She afterward studied
in Lincoln Academy and in Oswego, N.Y. In
1883 she was called to Westbrook Seminary
as teacher of English, and the following year
was appointed Preceptress of that institution,
which position she has since held. The years
1888 and 1889 she s])ent in Europe, continuing
the study of French and German, and upon
her return to the seminary was made the
teacher of modern languages. One who knows
her well thus speaks of her: "A noble woman,
she has a high ideal of her profession, and is
a devoted, conscientious, efficient teacher.
Sympathetic, unaffected, and genial, .she wins
the affectionate regard of all who know her.
From the combined qualities of her parents
she has inherited self-poise, self-reliance, integ-
rity of purpose, and a calm, clear judgment.
Her ability and consecration make her the
prized co-operator with the conuiiittee on teach-
ers in the earnest efforts to make Westbrook
Seminary a blessing to all its pupils."

Miss Morton is well known in Portland and
the vicinity, not only in educational affairs,
but also as a woman of progressive thought
and wide and liberal interests. She is an active
member of the Woman's Literary Union of

Portlaml, and is the president of the W. S.
German Club of that city.



CLARA PHILENA BIGELOW (Mrs.
George Brooks Bigelovv), in maiden-
hood Chira Pliilena Bean, is a Bos-
tonian by birth anil breeding. The
tlaugliter of Ivory and Hannah M. (Noble)
Bean, on the paternal side she is directly,
though remotely, desceniled from an old Scot-
tish clan, anil through her mother is connected
with the Eastman family, to which the mother
of Daniel Webster belonged.

From manuscript recorils in the possession
of Mrs. Bigelow it -is apparent that she is a
descendant more immediately, on the paternal
side, of John Bean (son of John and Lydia
Sloper Bean), who went from Gilmanton,
N.H., to Lewiston, Me., and thence to New
Sharon, Me., where he died about 1828-30.
His wife was Betsey Moody, a descendant of
an old New England family in a collateral line
with that founded by AVilliam Moody, who
came from England to Ipswich, Mass., in
1633, and settled in Newbury in 1635. (See
Lancaster's Genealogical History of Gilmanton,
N.H.) John and Betsey were the parents
of four sons and three daughters — Samuel,
John, Ivory, Isaiah, Hannah, Lydia, and
Sarah.

Ivory Bean, son of John and grandfather
of Mrs. Bigelow, was born in Lewiston, May 7,
1791. He served as a cai)tain in the War of
1812. He married in New Sharon (as shown
by the town clerk's records), December 29,
1814, Philena Pitts Savage, of Freeman, Me.
Their children, born in New Sharon, were:
Orison, Ivory (born June 2, 1818), Rosanna
Weymouth, Loren, Hiram Pitts, Philena,
Thaxter Whitney, and James Loring. The
father. Ivory, died in New Sharon in 1842.

Ivory Bean, second, son of Ivory and
Philen;i, married Hannah Matilda Noble, daugh-
ter of Samuel and Hannah (I^astman) Noble, of
Lisbon, Me. According to a manuscript vol-
ume of one hundred and eleven pages, com-
piled by Mary Eastman Bridges, of San Fran-
cisco, and dated 1894, Hannah Eastman's line
of descent was as follows: Roger' Eastman,



born 1611 in Wales, came to America in ship
"Confidence" in 1638, settled in Salisbury,
Mass., where he died in 1694. SamueP East-
man, born in 1657, moved to Kingston, Me.,
about 1720, being one of the original grantees
of that town. He married Elizabeth Sever-
ance in 1686; married in 1719, for second wife,
Sarah Fifield, who died in 1726. Thomas'
Eastman, born January 21, 1703, lived in
Kingston, married in 1729 Abigail French.
Samuel,^ son of Thomas and Abigail, born in
1730, died in 1799, married a Miss Hubbard.
He seems to have lived for a while in New
Hampshire, probably in Pittsfield; but about
1761 he removed to Maine. He built the
Togus Bridge. SamueP Eastman, born in 1767,
married Sally Stevens, and settled in Gardiner,
Me. They were the parents of Hannah"
(born 1806, died 1863), who became the wife of
Samuel Noble, as above mentioned.

The education of Clara P. Bean began at a
private school in Boston known as the " Pho-
netic School." Later she attended succes-
sively the Everett School, under Master Hyde,
Professor York's boarding-school, where she
was a student for two years, and the well-
known private school of Mr. Hooper on Bow-
doin Street, Boston.

She (Clara P. Bean) was married in 1869 to
George Brooks Bigelow, a well-known lawyer
of Boston. Mr. Bigelow was of old colonial
stock, being a lineal descendant of John Biglo,
of Watertown, Mass., the founder of the Bige-
low family of New England. Mr. Bigelow died
July 7, 1901. Of this marriage there were no
children.

Mrs. Bigelow has lived and travelled abroad.
While in Paris she entered as a pupil the studio
of Monsieur Perrault (a pupil of the famous
Bouguereau). She has studied water-colors
under Susan Hale (sister of the Rev. Dr. Ed-
ward E. Hale) and others. She has also stud-
ieil modelling in clay from life under the well-
known sculptor, Henry Kitson.

Mrs. Bigelow is a member of many clubs,
among them New England \\'oman's Club,
Woman's Club House Corporation (of which
she was one of the founders and is at present
a director), the National Council of Women
(life member), Boston Business League, Fathers'



442

and Mothers' Club, Floral Emblem Society,
Ladies' Physiological Institute, Women's Edu-
cational and Industrial LTnion (life member),
and Phi Eta Sigma (Emerson College) Oratory.
She is also a member, and was for three years
secretary, of the General Washington Memorial
Association.

After the death of her husband she turned
her attention in another line, and entered the
Emerson College of Oratory in 1901, taking
the full course, and, graduating 1904, will
continue through the post-graduate, 1905. She
is this year (1904) a student at the Harvard
Summer School.

Mrs. Bigelow is a woman of strong character.
She is well kno^^'n in the social world. Her
sympathies are quick, her appreciation very
keen, her loyalty never failing, her charity
unbounded. e. c.



ELISABETH SOPHIA MERRITT
GOSSE was born in Salem, Mass., being
the daughter of Henry and Elisabeth
(Hood) Merritt. Her father, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Henry Merritt, at the breaking out
of the war of the Rebellion was on the staff of
General Joseph Andrews, in connnand at Fort
Warren, later going to the front, where, at the
head of his regiment, the Twenty-tiiird Massa-
chusetts, he was killed at the battle of New-
bern, N.C.

Mrs. Gosse's mother was the daughter of
the Rev. Jacob Hood, a well-known Congre-
gational clergyman. Mrs. Gosse is descended
from Robert Moulton, an Admiral in the Brit-
ish navy; also from Governor Bradstrect, Roger
Conant, and other notables of colonial days.

It is a curious coincidence tliat her great-
great-grandfather. Captain Samuel Flint, killed
in the battle of Saratoga in 1777, was the high-
est officer from E.ssex County who gave his
life for his country in the war of the Revolu-
tion; and the same is true of her father, Colonel
Merritt, in the war of the sixties. Another
ancestor, Colonel Philip Gardner, was killed
in the French anil Indian wars, in colonial days.
It is said that no woman in Massachusetts
has a longer record of military ancestry than
Mrs. Gosse.



Elisabeth S. Merritt (to use the name she
bore m her student days) was educated in pub-
lic and private schools of Salem, the Chelsea
High School, Salem Normal School, and the
Rockford Woman's College, at Rockford, 111.
She married Mr. Charles Harrison Gosse, of an
old Salem family. For a few years Mr. and
Mrs. Gosse resided in Salem, but later removed
to Boston, where Mrs. Gosse's literary ability
soon attracted attention, and she received re-
quests for her work from three of the leading
Boston journals.

In 1S8S .she went to Bar Harbor as a society
correspondent for the Tron.srn'pl and other
Boston papers. The excellence of her work
caused it to be copied by other society editors
in every part of the United States. She was
especially fortunate in having as personal
friends Mrs. William Morris Hunt, the first
Mrs. William C. Whitney, and Colonel Elliott
F. Shepard, who had been a close friend of
her father.

Returning to Boston in the fall of that year,
she was sent to Lenox by the Boston Herald,
with which paper she has since been promi-
nently connected, having held staff positions
in five different departments, giving her prob-
ably a more varied career than that of any
other newspaper woman in New England and
one with many picturesque experiences. From
the society department of the Herald she passed
into the department of special writers, where
she received exceptional training in political
antl editorial work. Later the special and
city departments of the Herald were consoli-
datetl, and for three years Mrs. Gosse gained
invaluable experience in reportorial work. Es-
pecially notable feats in this line accomplished
by her were the reporting of the great costume
ball of the Boston Artists' Association, given
in the Art Museum several years ago, on which
occasion four men reporters and several artists
worked under her direction; the reporting of
a convention in Tremont Temple, for which
she received from the Herald a check for one
hundred and two dollars, at that time said to
be the largest check ever paid to a woman jour-
nalist in New England for a single week's work,
and the reporting of the evolutions of the
North Atlantic Squadron off the coast of Maine,

when she was the guest of Admiral Gherardi
and the only passenger allowed by the Secre-
tary of the Navy on board the flagship "Phil-
adelphia."

Mrs. Gosse has travelled hundreds of miles
in the service of the Herald, accompanying
President Harrison, President Cleveland, and
the late Secretary Blaine upon long journeys.
Upon the occasion of the latter's resignation
from the Harrison cabinet she went to Wash-
ington, and, returning to Boston with Secre-
tary and Mrs. Blaine, remained with them at
the Brunswick for three days, while awaiting
the returns from the Minneapolis convention,
the only woman in a small army of represent-
atives of all the prominent dailies in the coun-
try. She was present when Mr. Blaine re-
ceived and read the despatch announcing the
nomination of Mr. Harrison and the death-
blow of his own hopes. "I knew," she .said
at the time, " that I was looking on while his-
tory was being made." That night she ac-
companied Mr. and Mrs. Blaine to Bar Harbor.
A week later the death of Emmons Blaine, in
Chicago, entailed uppn her another long journey.

Mrs. Gosse also achieved great success as
a special correspondent, her work always being
of intense interest. Her interviews with Cardi-
nal Gibbons were copied into nearly every
Catholic publication in the country. She in-
terviewed Presidents Cleveland and Harri-
son and many members of their Cabinets.

Especially notable service was rendered
the Herald by Mrs. Gosse when she carried
the news of the death of James Russell Lowell
from Bar Harbor to President Eliot at his
summer residence at Seal Harbor, and later
that of George William Curtis. In each in-
stance she rode twenty-two miles at midnight
over the roads of Mount Desert, to telegraph
his tributes to those great men to her paper.
During one Presidential campaign she remained
in Maine until after the State election, report-
ing the speeches of many prominent political
orators.

Mrs. Gosse was among the first to discern
the importance and phenomenal development
of the woman's club movement. She estab-
lished the department "Among the W^omen's
Clubs" in the Sunday Herald, which she still



conducts, and also that known as "Colonial
and Patriotic," a record of the happenings
among the hererlitary patriotic societies.

In addition to her work for the Herald, Mrs.
Gosse has done much special work for the
New York Mail and Express and the New
York Herald, also for such publications as the
North American Review, the New England Mag-
azine, Harper's Bazar, Wide Awake, and I^ip-
pincott's.

Mrs. Gosse has been prominently identified
with the New England Woman's Press Asso-
ciation from the beginning. For several years
she was chairman of the programme commit-
tee, preparing some of the most successful
entertainments in the history of the club, and
she was its president in 1898. L^pon retiring
from the presidency she was made honorary
vice-president for life.

She was founder and is vice-presiilent of
the Boston W'oman's Press Club, has been four
times elected president of the Boston Business
League, and is also president for life of the
Boston Floral Emblem Society. She has been
much interested in reform work, being a promi-
nent promoter of the movement to secure police
matrons. She was also for a time press super-
intendent of the W. C. T. U. Deeply inter-
ested in music and a fine musician herself, she
has been an active worker in the Easter Music
and Flower Mission to Hospitals.

Mrs. Gosse has been an enthusiastic organ-
izer of women's clubs, .several of prominence
in various parts of New England o,wing their
existence to her efforts. She has several times
as a delegate attendetl the biennial convention
of the General P'ederation of W'omen's Clubs.

The family of Mrs. Gosse were among the
leading anti-slavery leaders in Essex County,
and enjoyed the friendship of John Greenleaf
W^hittier, William Lloyd Garrison, and many
others prominent at that time. It was well
known that the poet Whittier, although a fiery
abolitionist, deprecated war. On one occa-
sion early in 1861 he escaped from Newbury-
port to avoid a military demonstration, only
to meet at dinner, at the friend's home in the
country where he sought refuge, the father
of Mrs. Gosse, Lieutenant Colonel Merritt, in
full uniform. The two became fast friends,

and Mr. Whittier was a sincere mourner be-
cause of the tragic death of Lieutenant Colonel
Merritt.

■In recent years Mrs. Gosse has been promi-
nent in the list of woman lecturers, her ser-
vices being especially sought by clubs and
classes in current events. A lecture on "The
World and the Newspaper" and various ethi-
cal and educational subjects have been among
her successes.

Mrs. Gosse is a sincere home lover, and en-
joys most of all her cosey home in Roxbury,
where she is surrounded by colonial furniture,
a profusion of plants and flowers, and several
interesting household pets.



MARY LYNCH GILMAN, a Past
Dejjartment President of the Wom-
an's Relief Corps of Massachusetts
and chairman of the Executive
Committee of Arrangements for the National
Convention in Boston, 1904, was born in Bos-
ton at the North End, which was at that time
a pleasant residential section of the city. Her
father, William Lynch, was a man of liberal
ideas, active in public affairs and successful
in accumulating property.

The girlhood days of Mary Lynch (Mrs.
Gilman) were passed in the vicinity of Copp's
Hill and under the shadow of Christ Church.
She was graduated from the old Hancock
School, and is a member of the Hancock School
Alumni Association. Her education was com-
pleted at a private institution of learning.

In 1870 she married John E. Gilman, who
was born December 22, 1844, in South Boston,
and has always been a resident of Boston.
Mr. Gilman was educated in the primary school
on East Street Place and the Quincy and Eliot
Grammar Schools. In August, 1862, he en-
listed in Company E, Twelfth Regiment, Massa-
chusetts Volunteers, under Colonel Fletcher
Webster, and went South to fight for the Union.
He was engaged in a number of battles, the
last being that of Gettysburg, in July, 1863,
where he was severely woimded, a shell striking
his right arm and breaking it at the elbow.
He was discharged for disability on the 28th
of the following October.



Mr. Gilman held different positions in the
State House from 1864 until 1883. Since
that time he has been in the service of the
city of Boston, first as settlement clerk in the
institutions department and since April 1,
1901, as commissioner in charge of the soldiers'
relief department. He has been a member
of the Grand Army of the Republic since 1868,
and is a Past Commander of Thomas G. Ste-
venson Post, No. 26, of Roxbury. He served
as Inspector of the Department of Massachu-
setts, G. A. R., in 1895, Junior Vice-Commander
in 1896, Senior Vice-Commander in 1897, dele-
gate at large to the National Encampment in
1898, and Department Commander in 1899, his
administration being one of the most successful
in the history of the organization.

Mr. Gilman was a member of the Executive
Committee of Arrangements and of other
committees for the National Encampment of
1904. He takes great interest in all the efforts
of his wife in the work of women's organiza-
tions, and they have travelled extensively
together in all parts of the State and to na-
tional gatherings in representing the work
of the Grand Army and Woman's Relief Corps.

As an eloquent speaker his services are in
great demand, and he has often adtlressed pub-
lic and social gatherings of the Woman's Relief
Corps, to which organization he is sincerely de-
voted.

At the thirty-eighth National Encampment
of the G. A. R., held in Boston, August 15-20,
1904, he was appointed Adjutant-general by
the newly elected Commander-in-chief, General
Wilmon W. Blackmar.

Mrs. Gilman united with Thomas G. Ste-
venson Corps, No. 63, of Roxbury, in 1886. As
Special Aide to Mrs. Eva T. Cook, of Glouces-
ter, Department President, she performed
important duties at the National Convention
in Louisville, Ky., having charge of the Ma.ssa-
chusetts headquarters at the Gait House.
She held successively the offices of Depart-
ment Inspector, chairman of the Executive
Board, Department Junior Vice-President, and
Senior Vice-President, and in 1900 was unani-
mously elected Department President. In that
capacity she had charge of the Massachusetts
delegation on the trip to the National Con-

vention in Chicago, and made many friends
among the delegations from the Western States
by her able management and courteous man-
ners. One of the pleasing features of her ad-
ministration was a dinner given in Faneuil
Hall to the ex-Prisoners of War Association,
which was a brilliant affair.

Throughout the year her official work was
conducted in an earnest, dignified, and gracious
manner, manifesting her imselfish devotion
to the cause. She was the recipient of many
courtesies from G. A. R. posts, and she retired
from the presidency with the respect of all
officers an(l her associates.

During her term the relief expenditures
in Massachusetts amounted to nearly twenty
thousantl dollars, and over a thou.sand dol-
lars atkiitional were expended for Memorial
Day work in the South, Antlersonville Prison
property, aid for veterans who suffered in
the Galveston (Tex.) disaster, and in other
relief outside the regular work in this State.

In her annual address, presented to the
Twenty-second Annual Convention, heUl in
Boston in February, 1901, she said: "Through-
out the year I have constantly borne in mind
the honor and the responsibility confided in
me, and it has been ever my aim so to perform
the duties of my office as to deserve your
approbation. You will be gratified to know
that by reason of greatest membership and
most generous dispensation of relief the dawn
of the twentieth century finds us still occupy-
ing that proud and enviable position, the
banner department of the Woman's Relief
Corps."

As a warm friend to the army nurses, she
referred to their society in Massachusetts as
follows: "This worthy and unique association
appeals with peculiar force to the sympathy
and friendship of the members of our order.
... 1 charge you to let no army nurse lack the
comforts of life while a dollar remains in the
treasuries of the corps of this department."

Appointed and installed as Department
Counselor at the close of this convention, she
rendered excellent service during the admin-
istration of Mrs. Evans, her successor.

Mrs. Gilman has been a National Aide, a
member of committees at National Conven-



tions, and at the convention in Washington,
D.C., in 1902, was elected chairman of the
National Executive Board.

As chairman of the Executive Committee
of Arrangements for the National Conven-
tion of 1904 in Boston, she devoted the
summer to the work of preparation for this
gathering of women, representing a mem-
bership of one hundred and fifty thousand.
A friend, referring to her qualifications for
office, recently wrote : " Mrs. Gilman is a woman
of fine executive ability and fearless integrity,
patriotic, benevolent, tactful, and broad-
minded, in every way a suitable leader for so
great an undertaking." She is a member
of the Ladies' Aid Association of the Soldiers'
Home in Massachusetts. She is a woman
of musical accomplishments, a pleasing con-
versationalist, and, as a speaker at public
gatherings, is always listened to with interest.

Mrs. Gilman was invited by Mrs. Alice M.
Goddard, chairman of the Entertainment Com-
mittee, to preside at the great camp-fire of the
Woman's Relief Corps held in Mechanics' Build-
ing on the evening of August 18, 1904. There
were more than ten thousand people present
on the occasion of this memorable gathering,
which was honored by the presence of national
and State officials. Mrs. Oilman's gracious
manner in presiding added to the interest of
this important event in the programme of En-
campment Week in Boston.

Associated with Mrs. Gilman in her work for
the National Convention was Mrs. Clara H. B.
Evans, of Pittsfield, Mass., under whose ad-
ministration as Department President in 1903
the preliminary plans were inaugurated. Mrs.
Evans, after conducting a successful year's
work and proving herself an able leader, travel-
ling twenty-five thousand miles in the perform-
ance of her duties, was chosen chairman of the
General Committee for the National Convention.

Having had charge of the delegation to Cali-
fornia the year previous, she was well fitted for
the duties of her position.

Among the visitors to Boston during National
Encampment Week were many thousand women
from all sections of the country, and those from
the West and South received a royal welcome
from the patriotic women of New England.

ylNNIE STEVENS PERKINS was born

L\ in Salem, Mass., April 12, 1868, the
JL \^ daughter of Charles Kimball and Mary
E. (Batchelder) Stevens. When she
was a year old, the family removed from Salem
to Somerville, and in that city Miss Stevens
spent the greater part of her school flays. She
speaks with sincere appreciation of the helpful
and stimulating influences of her Prescott
School life, which was spent wholly unrler the
inspiring principaLship of Gordon A. Southworth,
now supervisor of schools in Somerville. She
also attended the high school of that city,
completing half of the college course. In June,
1884, the family removed to Lynnfield, from
which town Miss Stevens attended the Salem
Normal School, completing the course in two
years and graduating in June, 1887, being the
poet of her class. The following year, at the
triennial gathering of the alumni of the school,
she was invited to write and read the poem.

Miss Stevens began to write verse at the
age of eight. Her first published work appeared
in the Radiator, the Somerville High School
paper, in 1882. She was a member of its
editorial staff. Her early work, both stories
and verse, was published in the Salem Ga-
zette, Watchman, Golden Rule, the Stiver Cross,
the Conlrihvtor, and other periodicals.

A sketch of this writer, under her maiden
name, appears, with a selection from her writ-
ings, in "Essex County Poets." Sidney Perley,
Esq., of Salem, the publisher of this work, .says
of her: "Her work is always meritorious, and
she is well worthy of the niche we have given
her in this volume, although the youngest of
the poets on our list."

"Thoughts of Peace," a dainty little book
of verse, and "Appointed Paths," a story for
girls, have been published by James H. Earle,
of Boston. These were pleasantly reviewed by



the Congregationalist and other papers. She
has also written many poems for public occasions
in her town, her poem written and read on the
occasion of the dedicating of the new Town
Hall being published in the History of Lynn-
field. A poem written in honor of the naming
of the Daniel Townsend Chapter of the Daugh-
ters of the Revolution, Lyim, was read by her
at the exercises in the old Town Hall of old
"Lynn End" and afterward, by request, at
an afternoon meeting of the D. A. R. at their
headcjuarters in Boston. At the Old Home
Day exercises of Lynnfield, held at Suntaug
Lake in August, 1903, she also read a poem
written for the occasion.

Miss Stevens was married November 28,
1889, to Mr. John Winslow Perkins, of L}'nn-
field, and went to live in the pretty cottage
built for the young couple on the Perkins
farm, which has been in the family since 1700,
this being the date of the erection of the home-
stead. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins have one child,
a boy of ten years, who has been given the
family name, John.

Mrs. Perkins taught in the public school
for a short time previous to her marriage, and
has had many private pupils, in whom she has
felt great interest, for she is very fond of young
people, and finds nothing more delightful than
the task of helping them to develop the powers
with which they are individually endowed.
The work of the teachers of our public schools
is an especial study, and Mrs. Perkins is always
enthusiastic in her appreciation of all that is
being done for the home through the school.
As editor of the department of "The Home
and the School," in the Suburban, Boston,
Mrs. Perkins is having an opportunity for foster-
ing the much-desired co-operation of parents
and teachers.

She was for a considerable time connected
with the Daily Ereniiuj Item, Lynn, as cor-
respondent from her town, sustaining very
pleasant relations with that well-known paper,
as also, in the same capacity, with the Citizen
and Banner, Wakefield, and has been for a
number of years doing regular work for the
Normal Instructor, New York, contributing
exercises, verse, reports, articles, and songs.

by the same house, uses much of her work, and
the editor has recently given into her charge
the page of music, which appears more or less
regularly, and to which she contributes origi-
nal rote and motion songs.

A quatrain which appeared some time ago
in the Teachers' World with other verses, has
been used as a memory gem in many schools,
and has proven to be a favorite with hundreds
of little pupils. Mrs. Perkins has heard many
pleasant words regarding it. It reatls : —

When the beautiful stars peep out one by one,

.\s I look far up and away,
How sweet to be able to whisper to God,

"I've made some one happy to-day!"

Her work for the Subiirban has brought
this writer into considerable local prominence,
the series of illustrated articles on "The Pipe
Organ in Suburban Homes" having attractetl
much favorable notice. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins
are enthusiastic camera workers, especially
delighting in interior work, which takes so
nmch time and care, but is so much appreciated.
The Suhitrhan has used a considerable amount
of their work in this line. In fact, for the
Suburban Mrs. Perkins is at present doing
niiicli of her literary work. Besides the illus-
trated work her stories and songs appear from
lime to time in that periodical.

Stories for the chiklren's page of Youth's
Companion, Our Little Ones, the Well-spring,
and other periodicals, have recently appeared.
Through Mrs. Bemis, editor of the Normal
Instructor, New York, Mrs. Perkins was some
time ago put into touch with Dr. Mary Wootl
Allen, of the Americaii Mother, to which maga-
zine she is now a contributor of sketches,
juvenile stories, and articles on the training
of children from the mother-teacher point
of view.

Mrs. Perkins is a member of the New England
Woman's Press A,ssociation, and of the Kosmos
Club of Wakefield.

She expresses sincere appreciation of the
inspiration of the work of Professor S. Henry
Hadley, supervisor of music of Somerville,
and Dr. Daniel B. Hagar, of Salem Normal
School, with regard to the fostermg of her
musical tastes. Professor George F. Wilson,



supervisor of music in Wakefield and Beverly
schools, uses verse written by Mrs. Perkins
for his songs for different grades, requesting
it as neeiled.

As a member of the Congregational Church
of Lynnfield Centre, Mrs. Perkins finds oppor-
tunity for religious work, having a class of
young ladies in the Bible school and serving
as clerk of the church, besides assisting in the
music on Sundays.

Mrs. Perkins wishes to pay a tribute to the
ever-helpful influence of one of the sweetest
mothers in the world and a hu.sband who de-
lights in and fosters any good woi-k she may
do for the home, and others as well.

Mrs. Beeman obtained her education in the
public schools of Cambridge and Hyde Park,
Mass. While still in school she studied dress-
making, which she began to teach at the age

she was not contented to remain at this occu-
pation, but in 1893-94 taught a public school
in Western Massachusetts, having previously
become a student at the New England Con-
servatory of Music. Later, at the age of twenty-
one, she entered the Emerson School of Oratory.
Graduating with honors from that institution
after the usual course, she accepted a position
there as teacher of music, physical culture, and
elocution, which .she held for several years.
She has since introduced physical culture and
oratory into the public schools in the vicinity
of Boston, devoting a great part of her time
to the instruction of teachers in this work,
with the approbation of the school authorities.
Her labors in this direction have also included

General Cheney was a Representative to the
General Court from 1808 to 1817. He was a
member of the committee of that body which
produced the remonstrance against the Em-

incorporation of the South Burial-ground in
Newton in 1802 and in the erection of the new
meeting-house in 1803-1805. He died February

the Masonic order. His father, Jacob B. Weth-
erell, was connected with the firm of Grover &amp;
Baker, manufacturers of the well-known .sewing
machines of that name, as superintendent, from
the first establishment of the firm to the time
of his death.

Mrs. Wetherell has always been interested in
church, charitable, and patriotic work. In
the early ])art of the Civil War she helped
in sending supplies to the soldiers at the
front.

She joined the Warren Avenue Baptist
Church of Boston, but transferred her member-

service as Department and National Aide in
the Woman's Relief Corps, and has been a
liberal contributor to its various funds. For
several years she has been a member of the
Department Relief Committee, a position re-
quiring a thorough knowledge of relief methods
and a love for the cause, and one which Mrs.
Wetherell is admirably adapted to fill, being
systematic, kind-hearted, and a woman of ex-
cellent judgment. She was a member of the
Executive Committee of Arrangements for
the National Convention held in Boston in
August, 1904, and of other committees.

she is a tlaughter of the late Henry Gillmore,
M.D., and Caroline Rice Gillmore, of Brook-
field, and on the maternal side grand-tlaughter
of Peter and Caroline Rice.

She was educated in the public schools and
also at a private school in her native town.
The ceremony which united her (Caroline A.
Gillmore) in marriage with Dr. Merrick Bemis,

a native of Sturbridge, took place on January
1, 1856. Dr. Bemis at that time was superinten-
dent of the State Lunatic Hospital at Worces-
ter, where he had previously been assistant to
Dr. Chandler. Retiring from the State Hospital
in 1872, after nearly twenty-five years' ser-
vice, he founded a private ho.spital, Herbert
Hall Asylum, named for George Herbert, the
English divine and poet. It is for mentally
diseased patients.

Although now (1903) in his eighty-third
year, Dr. Bemis is in full possession of all his
faculties. He is the manager of the hospital
and an interested worker in public affairs in
Worcester, being always ready to advance
every good cause.

For nearly twenty years Mrs. Bemis was the
efficient matron of the Stafe Lunatic Hospital
at Worcester. In her early labors she received
the friendly council of the distinguished philan-
thropist, Dorothea L. Dix. Mrs. Bemis con-
tinues her active duties as matron at Herbert
Hall, tlispensing comfort and happiness to
all with whom she associates. Cheerfulness
is one of her principles, and combined with
an unselfish spirit has made her life work emi-
nently successful. During extended travels
abroad some years since, she visited hospitals
and other institutions, adding to the value
of her experience by study of foreign methods.

Dr. and Mrs. Bemis have one son. Dr. John
Merrick Bemis. He was born February 14,
1860, and is now assistant physician at the
Herbert Hall Asylum.



A UGUSTA MERRILL HUNT, the first
/\ president of the Portland branch of
J^ \^ the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, is a native of Portland, Me.,
being the youngest daughter of the late George
Simonton and Ellen (Merrill) Barstow, of that
city, and until her marriage known as Augusta
M. Barstow. In 1863 she became the wife of
George S. Hunt, a leading merchant of Port-
land.

For many years Mrs. Hunt and two of her
sisters, Mrs. Susan E. Bragdon and Mrs. G. B.
McGregor, following in the footsteps of their
mother, have been prominently identified with



educational and philanthropic work. Mrs.
Bragdon was the first president of the Woman's
Literary Union and a devoted worker in the
Portland Fraternity. Mrs. McGregor is the
founder and promoter of the Maine Home for
Friendless Boys. Mrs. Hunt retained the office
of president of the Portland Woman's Christian
Temperance Union for fifteen years. Under
her direction the Coffee House and Friendly
Inn, the Flower and Diet Missions, Day Nur-
sery, and Free Kindergartens were adopted as
branches of the work of this organization; and
the office of police matron was also established,
Portland being the first city to recognize the
importance of having a woman to care for the
unfortunate of her own sex. In the National
Christian Temperance Union Mrs. Hunt has
been the superintendent of several departments.
In 1884 she was chosen by the Governor of the
State to co-operate with a Legislative Commit-
tee in the interests of the boys at the State
Reform School. Here her womanly tact and
kindness, combined with a thorough knowledge
of the school, made her advice and services val-
uable to the institution, and she was indirectly
the means of bringing about some needed im-
provements that proved of great benefit to the
boys. On the death of her mother, Mrs. Ellen
M. Barstow; in 1873, Mrs. Hunt succeeded her
on the board of management of the Home for
Agetl Women, and for the ))ast sixteen years
has been the honored president of this well-
known society. She has been prominently
connected with woman's suffrage organiza-
tions, and at present is Maine superintendent
of franchise of the Woman's Christian Tem-
perance Union. For ten years she was the
president of the Portlanil W^oman's Council,
auxiliary to the National Council, which con-
sists of eighteen affiliated societies having a
membership of several thousand-, lender her
leadership the Council was instrumental in
having a law pas.sed which gives to a mother
an equal right with the father in the care and
guanlianship of minor children, and also a law
which i)ermits the election of women to the
school board.

Mrs. Hunt is well known at the State Capitol
by her appeals to the Legislature for the estab-
lishment of the cottage system at the Reform



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



451



School for Boys, also for addresses in the inter-
est of a reformatory prison for women and in
the cause of equal suffrage. Her presentation
of these subjects has been remarkable for fore-
sight and sound reason, with an earnestness and
womanly grace which appealed to both the
minds and hearts of her hearers. Though ac-
tively itlentified with so many public interests
in her native city and State, she has always
consistently maintained that a woman's first
duty was to her home, and she has never alloweil
anything to interfere with her family and social
relations. The generous hospitality of Mrs.
Hunt and of her husband, in his lifetime, has
long made her home a centre of attraction to
kinsfolk, friends, and distinguished guests
Mr. Hunt died in 1S96. Their two sons are
living, one in Portland, the other in Minne-
apolis.



LELIA FRANCES BASSETT ROCK-
WOOD, Department Patriotic Instruc-
J tor of the Woman's Relief Corps of
Massachusetts, was*born November 4,
1843, in Little Falls, N.J. She is descended on
her father's side from William Bassett, who
came to Plymouth in the second forefather ship,
the "Fortune," in 1621. Joseph Bassett, her
great-grandfather, was a Revolutionary soldier.
(His record can be found in " Massachasetts
Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolu-
tion," vol. i., p. 760, Captain John Callender's
Company.)

Nathaniel Bowman Brown Bassett, her father,
was born October 19, 1814, in Plymouth, Vt.,
and died July 10, 1866, in Milford, Mass. He
was a teacher in Albany and .several other
places in New York and in New Jersey, but
failing health compelled him to give up the
profession which he had followed with success
for many years.

Mrs. Rockwood's mother, Caroline Fisher
Ba.ssett, daughter of Benjamin Fisher, was born
in West Fairlee, Vt., and died in Milford, Mass.,
July 29, 1899. She was descended from An-
thony Fi.sher, an Engli.sh Puritan, who settled
in Dedham, Massachusetts Bay Colony, in
1637.

Lelia Frances Bassett (Mrs. Rockwood) at-



tended the public schools of Milford until she
reached the age of fourteen, and subsequently
for several years pursued a regular cour.se of
study under the instruction of her father, who
was then a confirmed invalid. She began to
teach in Milfonl when she was eighteen years
of age, and continued in this work until June,
1876. The school committee in their report
for that year referred to her as follows : " We
have few changes to report. One of them is
the resignation of Miss Lelia F. Bassett. For
years she taught the primary school in the
upper room of the old Town House. Under
her care it grew to be a model .school, excelling
in gooil order and in rapid advance of the
pujMls in study. She possessed superior gifts
as a teacher, and in her resignation the town
has met a loss not easy to repair. But what
is our loss is another's gain. As Mrs. Rock-
wood she carries with her the good wishes of
hundreds of parents who had learned to es-
teem her as the kind and judicious teacher of
their children."

Samuel Rockwood, to whom Miss Bassett
was married July 2, 1876, was a native of Mil-
ford, Mass., being a son of Deacon Peter and
Sabra (Parnell) Rockwood. He died in Milford,
April 6, 1S97.

Mrs. Rockwood joined the Pine Street Bap-
tist Church on July 3, 1864. She has been a
teacher in the Sunday-school continuously to
the present time. She is active and helpful in
all branches of the work of the church. She
servetl for several years as president of the
Woman's Circle, and also as president of the
Woman's Missionary Society. Chosen clerk of
the church on July 3, 1885, she has performed
her duties in that capacity so satisfactorily
that she continues in the office, her faithfulness
and ability being recognized by all the members.
During all the years she has held this position
she has ofhcially re])resente(l the church at con-
ventions, councils, and other meetings. She
is one of the original members and has been a
director in the Woman's Auxiliary to the Young
Men's Christian Association, which was organ-
ized in 1888. She worked untiringly for its
success for fourteen years, serving as treasurer
eleven years. Other duties compelled her to
resign from official work in this association,



452



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



but she retains her membership and continues
her interest.

The Milford Improvement Society elected her
a director when first organized. The Quinshi-
paug Woman's Club, of Milford, Hopedale, and
Mendon, was organized June 8, 1897, and Mrs.
Rockwood was elected treasurer, serving also
two years as a director. When the social service
department of the club was started, in 1899,
she was one of the committee of five appointed
to have charge of it. During the two years .she
served on this committee the stamp savings
system was introduced into some of the schools,
meeting with great success. This is one of
Mrs. Rockwood 's pet schemes, as she believes
in developing habits of thrift among the children
of the public schools by encouraging them to
save their ))ennies.

Having literary ability, she has prepared
papers for the Woman's Club and other socie-
eties. She is thoroughly patriotic, and takes
a deep interest in all matters relating to the
Grand Army of the Republic. As a member
of Major E. F. Fletcher Relief Corps, No. 72,
of Milford, she has done excellent work in vari-
ous offices and on committee!^. Wlien presi-
dent of the corps, in 1899-1900, she conducted
the work in a pleasing and efficient manner,
representing it .so creditably on public occa-
.sions that higher honors were conferred upon
her. The Department Convention of Massa-
chusetts has at several of its sessions elected her
a delegate to National Conventions. , While
serving in this capacity she has visited Western
and Southern cities, her interest in patriotic
work extending throughout the Union.

As Assistant Inspector she -showed such a
knowledge of her duties and capability of im-
parting instruction that she was appointed
Department Inspector in 1901 by Mrs. Maria
W. Going, Department President. Her report
at the next annual convention covered fifteen
printed pages, one paragraph of which shows
the variety of work accomplished: "It has been
my privilege to visit many of our corps per-
sonally, and everywhere I have found the same
spirit of charity, loyalty, and helpfulness among
my co-workers, and have been cordially re-
ceived by them at all times; and, whether
standing with them on the top of 'Old Grey-



lock' Mountain or on the sandy beach of Prov-
incetown, I have felt, as never before, that the
future good of our country was assured by
reason of the noble, earnest women who com-
prise our membership.

"I have attended all the Council meetings,
been present at four County Associations meet-
ings, instructed eight corps, attended eighteen
exemplifications and social days combined, was
present at the institution of the corps in Web-
ster, inspected twelve corps, installed the officers
of six corps, was a delegate to the National
Convention at Cleveland, Ohio, have written
six hundred ninety-eight letters, and have at-
tended to various other matters pertaining to
my oflRce. I also repre.sented the Department
at the Barnstable County Association at Sand-
wich." Mrs. Rockwood journeyed to Califor-
nia with the official party of the Department of
Massachusetts, Grand Army of the Republic,
and Woman's Relief Corps, and served as a
delegate at the convention in San Francisco.
She made an extended tour in the State, and
was the recipient of many courtesies from
friends.

At the convention held in Boston February
11 and 12, 1892, Mrs. Rockwood was chosen a
member of the Department ExeGlitive Board.
She has continued her visits to corps, partici-
pating also in Grand Army gatherings, public
meetings, and receptions. Her remarks on
these occasions are always interesting, and their
effect is aided by her pleasing manner. At the
annual convention, February, 190.3 (having
previously declined to be a candidate for the
office of Junior Vice-President), she accepted
an appointment as Department Patriotic In-
structor, conferred by Mrs. Clara H. B. Evans,
Department President. Mrs. Rockwood is a
National Aiile in the W. R. C. She is now
doing active work in preparing for the National
Eiicnmpment of tlic G. A. R. and National
Convention of the W. R. C. in Boston in August
of this year (1904), being chairman of the
Auditing Connnittee and a member of the
Executive Committee, Reception Committee,
and Floral Committee.

Mrs. Rockwood anticipates joining a chapter
in the D. A. R. and the Colonial Dames, to each
of which organizations she is eligible.




NINA K. DAKLINGTONE AND DAUGHTERS



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



453



NINA KELTON DARLINGTONE, the
author and originator of a system of
musical training and instruction copy-
righted under the title of " Kindergar-
ten Music-Building; the S'cience of Music, Art,
and Education."

To picture for the public the essentially
selfless toil and privations of an originator and
philanthropist in any work is hardly possible:
only those who have passed through the strug-
gle know the cost. A glance at the system
of education, "Kindergarten Music-Building;
the Science of Music, Art, and Education,"
gives but a faint idea of its vastness and the
painstaking labor that gave it birth.

Nina K. Darlingtone, though originally from
Philadelphia, is descended through her mater-
nal grandfather from New Englantl colonists.
Tracing her ancestry, we find a long line coura-
geously braving hardships, leaving their native
land, becoming pioneers in a new country for
conscience' sake, fighting in the early wars,
holding responsible offices, conducting public
affairs, and fearlessly tlevoting themselves
to humanity's needs.

On the maternal side we find Thomas Miner,
who came to this country about 1630. He
joined the church in Charlestown, Mass., in
1632, married Grace Palmer in 1634, and later
removed to Stonington, Conn., where he ended
his days. His diary shows him to have held
almost every office within the gift of his fellow-
town.smen. His notes began with the day of
the week, day of the year, year of our Lord, and
year of creation, not forgetting the mention of
leap-year. This diary seems to have been a
public ilocument, hence the more valuable. A
descendant of one of his twelve children was
Governor W. T. Miner, of Connecticut (1855-
57). Captain John Miner, sou of Thomas and
a personal friend of Governor Winthrop, was
skilletl in the Intlian dialects, and served as in-
terpreter. He was for many years Town Clerk
of Wootlbury, Conn. His daughter Grace
married Samuel Grant, Jr., of Windsor, Conn.,
in 1688, and thus became an ancestress of
Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United
States.

Charles Miner, the historian of Wyoming and
a great-grandfather of Nina K. Darlingtone,



was son of Soth and Ann (Charlton) Miner and
a lineal descendant of Thomas, the immigrant.
Born in Norwich, C(jnn., in 1780, he migrated
to Pennsylvania in 1799, and two or three years
later settled in Wilkesbarre. He served in the
State Legislature in 1807 and 1808, and he in-
troduced many bills that are now on the statute
books of that State. During the younger Presi-
dent Atlams's administration he was in Con-
gress with Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and
other noted statesmen, personal letters from
each of whom to Mr. Miner are still in the family.
The Hon. Charles Miner was a strong anti-
slavery man. In January, 1829, he made an
eloquent speech in the House of Representa-
tives, and presented the first bill advocating
measures to bring about the gradual abolition
of slaveiy in the District of Cohnnbia. At
the conclusion of his speech, as narrated in
later tlays by one of the family, Mr. W'ebster
followed him into the lobby, and, throwing
his arms around him, said, "Mr. Miner, you
have kindled a fire that will burn from Maine
to Georgia."

Mr. Miner's thought was ever for the good of
the community. He was a zealous promoter
of public improvements, as railways and canals.
He introduced anthracite into many homes,
and, in company with two other gentlemen,
was the first to ship this hard coal of Wyoming,
which hatl been thought of little value, down
the Lehigh River to Philadelphia.

Many amusing and curious stories are told of
the introiluction of "these black stones," as the
people calkxl them. Once they were incredu-
lous about their merit as fuel. On one occa-
sion several men had worked for hours to make
the coal burn, and, finally deciding that the
task was impossible, had closed the stove iloor
and gone out to dinner, incensed at the waste
of time and labor. What was their amaze-
ment on returning to find a Ijrilliant fire burn-
ing and the room as warm as a day in summer!

Charles Miner's father, Seth Miner, was on
General Jed Huntington's staff in the Revolu-
tionary W^ar.

The old Miner homestead, on the plains near
Wilkesbarre, Pa., has been standing for about
a century, and is still in possession of the
family.

It is said that one of the progenitors of the
family in the Middle Ages was knighted on the
field of battle for his valiant deeds; and because
of his owning great tracts of land, including
mines of value, his name became Sir Thomas
the Miner. It is also interesting to note that his
descendants to-day are possessors of mines in
the coal district of Central Pennsylvania, left
to them by Charles Miner, whose legal papers
read that coal should be granted to his heirs
and their descendants free of cost forever.

Inrlirectly, Nina K. Darlingtone is related to
Priscilla Mullins and John Alden, this fact em-
phasizing the New England connection.

Ancestors of hers noted for sterling worth,
brave in the discharge of duty, and suffering
persecution for conscience' sake, are found in
the Lewis family, the direct line of the ma-
ternal grandfather, which originated in Wales.
Henry Lewis, a member of the Society of
PViends, came to this country in 1682, his
father, Evan Lewis, accompanying him, and
settled in Philadelphia. The interests of Welsh
immigrants were committed to his care by
William Penn, his personal friend, who ap-
pointed him one of three to decide all questions
in place of the court. He purchased vast tracts
of land, and owned both a town house and a
country manor. In the seventh generation, in
direct line, was Nina K. Darlingtone's maternal
grandfather, the Hon. Joseph J. Lewis, an emi-
nent lawyer, interested in all educational mat-
ters, who was Commissioner of Internal Revenue
under Abraham Lincoln and a valued personal
friend of the President, by whom important
questions were often referred to his clear, un-
biassed judgment. His grand-daughter treas-
ures, among other recollections of him, this,
that was told to her in her girlhood: He had
been invited to join the family party to attend
the theatre on the night of the President's
assassination, but, unable to be present, was
spared the shock of witnessing the fatal deetl,
to be of service to the family in their hour of
need. His son, the late Charlton T. Lewis,
LL.D. (recently deceased), editor of Harper's
"Book of Facts" and author of the Latin dic-
tionary said officially to be used as the standard
in Oxford and Cambridge Universities, England,
was poet of his class in graduating from Yale



College; and later two sons of Charlton T. Lewis
each received the same compliment at gradua-
tion. Graceanna Lewis, a well-known scientist,
an authority on ornithology, is a member of this
branch of the family."

Joseph J. Lewis's mother, Alice Jackson, was
a noted mathematician of her day. Still in the
possession of a descendant of the family is the
estate in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which
it is said was seen in a vision by the original
owner, the Jackson immigrant, before he left
his old home in Ireland to found a new one in
a land where he could worship God, unmolested,
in the way that he felt was right and true.

Nina K. Darlingtone's father, Charles Thorn-
ton Murphy, a resident of Philadelphia, is a great
lover of music and art, a composer of ability,
and a natural artist. His setting of Oliver
Wendell Holmes's battle hymn, " God bless our
Flag," fitly illustrates his musical quality. His
father, John H. Murphy, fearing, with old-time
prejudice, that he would devote his life to
music, sent him to sea for five years; but,
though separated from his beloved instrument,
his musical nature held its own. The father's
influence, however, was great enough afterward
to induce him to adopt a business career. In
his wife, Alice C. Lewis, he found a willing sym-
pathizer and ready listener, and thus was woven
into the home life their own interpretation of
music for the very love of it.

Mr. Murphy's mother, whose maiden name
was Saunderson, was a descendant of Robert
Carter, of "Corotoman," I^ancaster County, Va.,
known as "King Carter," who was born about
1663, son of John and Sarah (Ludlow) Carter;
the royal descent of "King Carter," and there-
fore of his posterity, with a long list of illus-
trious progenitors, among them Charlemagne
and the Emperor -Frederick Barbarossa, is of
undisputed authenticity (see "Ancestry of Ben-
jamin Harrison, President of the United States,
1889-93," with included chart, by Charles P.
Keith).

Into this musical and intellectual atmosphere
came the first-born of eight children, the child
Nina, named for a song and destined to bless
all good inclination and help others to trust
holy heart impulses. As usual with those
whose abilities are of an unusual order and



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



455



beyond what the world cognizes, she suffered
from uncongenial environment; but, though this
blighted outward expression, it did not tleter
the child's inner growth, even as the careless
crushing of a flower does not hinder the ema-
nating of the perfume. As the eldest of eight
children, she was ever the mother's helper and
confidant, sharing in the interest of the home
and little ones. When only three years old
she saved her smaller sister from falling from
a high window, holding on to the child's foot
and crying out until some one came to her aid.
At the age of ten years she entered the conserv-
atory of music at Philadelphia, and for two
or three broken years at school enjoyed the ad-
vantages of musical education. After two years
of boarding-school life ,slie was graduated the
first in her class, though she had been a member
of it for music study for the last six months
only. At home in Philadelphia two years of
excellent drill under a well-known master.
Professor Henri Schneider, completed her musi-
cal training. This shows conclusively that per-
severance in the natural development of the
musical nature, belonging, as it does, to the
deeper, or spiritual, is ever of more value than
mere intellectual training.

At fourteen she began to teach music to a
cousin, and also to her brothers and sisters, the
cousin being older than herself. Thus we see
her at an early age beginning life's duties se-
riously, earnestly, ever with a fixetl determina-
tion to overcome the evil of ignorance with true
understanding, and holding to the quiet, inner
meditation in lieu of formal instruction from
without. She thus discovered that this study
alone fits one to give out the true substance
worthy the distribution to others. This did
not hinder her from entering into all the games
of childhood with ready zest, settling disputes
with an ab.solute justice that allowed no ques-
tion of ulterior motive or of partiality. Lovetl
and trusted by her associates, she grew into
intimate and lasting friendships, upon which
she leaned for the aid and sympathy most es-
sential to a loving, confiding nature.

In her first teaching of young children she
realized strongly their need of a natural system ;
and oftentimes a music lesson was given the
little student on the vine-covered porch or



under the garden trees, the piano being sought
after the problems in hand had been solved to
the satisfaction of teacher and pupil. She
waited, hoping that some one else would bring
out such a system as she herself was unwittingly
in process of unfo'ding. As life's experience
deepened, further insight was gained into these
matters; and within three years after her mar-
riage, which occurred in the spring of 1892,
the birth of her first child, Linda Frederika
(December, 1894), brought the experience and
joys of motherhood. Her life was further en-
riched by a second daughter, Aylsa Winona
Lewis, born in January, 1896. Three years of
invalidism gave her opportunity for quiet
thought and earnest pondering on many things.

The lack of a general musical atmosphere was
apparent, and the need of such for the budding
thought made her long to gather the little ones
about her and create at least some intelligent
love for the beauty of art and the ability to
grasp inner meanings of harmony so success-
fully hitlden from the ignoramus in the tone
world.

Many unanswered questions had pursuetl her
from her early years, questions which her elders
could not answer. She had soon observeil that
the child nurtured under its mother's influence
was the one to achieve in the world's history
of great deeds; also that the child of genius
was permitted to unfold in the first attempts
at expression without interference from out-
side. U'hat was the cause back of these effects?
She knew that The Creator who had createtl
all things good could not fail to give humanity
a remetly for every ill. The God of Love could
not omit that which would heal every broken
life and heart, but why the necessity of pass-
ing through neeiUess agony to learn lessons
easily taught? Surely there must be a preven-
tative of such perversion of the natural in an
educational system that would allow the child
to find himself wholesomely in the kingdom
of the Eternal King, under whose laws he
might unfoUl and expand naturally, growing
daily in brightness and beauty within until the
full time of expression, when, like the bud
opening into flower, the well-balanced child
would enter a serene manhood or womanhood,
growing healthfully because his true instincts



456



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



had been nourished and strengthened, not
thwarted nor suppressed until reaction and per-
version had occurred. Such questions were
stirring the active thought of the founder of
the "Science of Music and Education" for
fifteen years, unanswered and unsolved by any
system in existence. " Are not all hearts seek-
ing for the same remedy?" she argued, and
in the wholeness of her searching prayer
the answer was reflected. In a single night
the light dawned, her health was restored, the
discovery made! The truth of the natural
law of unfoldment and its relation to the child
was revealed. God's gift to little children was
no longer a dream, but a present reality. To
take the message at once to the little ones
became her greatest neetl.

Like a pioneer teacher of old, Pestalozzi,
who gave forth the first expression of his new
idea to a class of children in an Ursuline con-
vent, so Nina K. Darlingtone, in the spring of
1896, though of the Protestant faith, was called
to teach the nuns in a convent, who had charge
of the musical department in their school.
Her re-entrance into active teaching found her
engaged with these anrl other pupils, who sought
from her chiefly ideas of interpretation. As a
teacher and worker for children, as well as for
those desiring to teach, the more mature woman,
with the two little ones of her own, had lost
none of the qualities which naturally reach the
childlike in heart and which children naturally
love. Nevertheless, when urged to teach
children at this period, she refusetl, feeling
the instruction of beginners to be the most
difficult problem of all, and one which she was
not yet ready to solve. On continued solicita-
tion, however, she consented to take the little
ones in a class and teach them in a body the
things in music they would not ordinarily
learn, and which she had for years imparted in
private teaching. Her interest in this work
grew rapidly; and, as the great educational idea
grew upon her, as means of making matters
comprehensible to the children, games were in-
vented, songs written, and thus the new method
spontaneously expressed itself.

l^nlike other systems, "Kindergarten Music-
building" is not the expression of a gradual
growth of thought, resulting from years of



practical teaching only. It is really a discov-
ery, the result of the author's life experience.
Thus the deep-sighted philosophy of this clear
and simple system came from an intense de-
sire to present the real essence of music and
education to the child in its spiritual signifi-
cance, as well as to help little hands and eyes
antl ears to grasp the ordinarily stupid and
confused beginnings of so complex a subject
as music.

The secret of the true environment for the
age of childhood is revealed, and as in the case
of the same natural law in relation to the seed,
which never changes while carried to the four
corners of the world as long as it is in the air,
but, once placed in the essential environment
of soft, moist earth, and given the proper nour-
ishment, rewards the labor of the planter by
a pleasing sign of growth, so it is with the little
child, and so should his mental and musical
development be regarded.

Absorbed in this work and in the love of it
for its own sake, she was unconscious of at-
tracting attention from the outside world, till
one day a teacher of nmsic asked to be taught
her system of instructing children. A second
and third, followetl by many more requests of
this nature, were made before she awoke to the
fact that she was starting a new era in music-
teaching, and that the world wanted her ideas.
Her thought had pierced the profundities of
musical symbolism and grappled successfully
with technical difficulties. She had looked at
the art from its mental side, and had reduced
all to the child's comprehension in natural
terms ; for she began at once what has ever been
her principle — to develop the individuality of
the student or teacher and to advocate no
copying of mere words.

In the winter of 1898, upon the solicitation of
the Froebel Preparatory School and the New
England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Nina
K. Darlingtone was prevailed upon to leave her
home in Philadelphia and establish her work in
Boston, where she now resides.

To the many hundreds of teachers who have
studied this system directly from her or through
correspondence, she has given much time and
patient love, resulting in enduring good. It is
customary to hear these students state that

the gaining of the work is a "direct answer to
earnest prayer" or "the true education found
for the first time after a life's search." Thus
this system has gone to all parts of the civilized
globe, and has representatives in every State
and in all the principal cities of our country.

From the tiniest tots of three or four years,
who learn their first lessons in "Kindergarten
Music-Building" in the simplest form, to the
adult who is still a child in heart, it is the nat-
ural system of education and nmsic for all.
This teaching has ever dwelt latent in the
mother-heart, but remained undiscovered for
the world until the present day. But to learn
it one nmst be willing to become as a little
child, even as such a change is also essential
in ortler to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

In 189S an organization was founded in Bo.s-
ton which will represent the work for future
generations. The membership during the first
year numbered over three hundred, including
some of the ablest men and women in this
country and Europe. Among them may be
found judges, musicians, composers, and lead-
ing educators, as well as the teachers of the
System.

SARAH ANNIE PERKINS was born
at Lewiston, Me., October 1, 1842,
the daughter of the Rev. Gideon and
Mary (Dunham) Perkins. Her father
was one of the early ministers of the Free
Baptist denomination. To unusual mental
grasp antl deep spiritual insight he added
ardent convictions that leil him to give valiant
.service to the temperance and anti-slavery
reforms of his day; anil the thrilling experi-
ences of tho.se historic years, together with
a most careful Christian training, made a deep
impression on the lives of his children.

Sarah received her education in the Lewis-
ton schools and in the Maine State Seminary,
now Bates College, located in the same town.
She entered the seminary at the age of four-
teen, was graduated at seventeen, and at
once took up the duties of a teacher, having
been a.ssigned even thus early in her life to
the responsible position of preceptress in the



Limerick (Me.) Academy. Before leaving
.school she had become a member of the Lewis-
ton Main Street Free Baptist Church, of which
her parents aijd three brothers were also
members.

The second year after graduation she a.ssumed
charge of the Dexter (Me.) High School,
but, being honored not long after by a call
to return to her Alma Mater, .she accepted it,
ami was installed as instructor in F'rench,
Latin, and other branches, a position which
she filled satisfactorily for .six years. She
then resigned to accept a similar one in a
private school for girls in Boston. Two
years later she entered the Lothrop Publishing
House as editor of book manuscripts. In this
congenial work an honorable and pleasant
career was opening before her, when the death
of her eldest brother, in 1873, changed her
p'lans for life. At his recjuest she unselfishly
relin((uished the task for which she had proved
herself to be so well fitted, and, taking his
orphan children into her care, for nearly
ten years she devoted herself to their nurture
and training, at the same time ministering
to the needs of her aged parents.

It was only when these duties had been
fulfilled that Miss Perkins permitted her taste
for literary work to a.ssert itself once more.
She accepted a position on the editorial staff
of the Morning Star — the official organ of
the Free Baptist denomination, published in
Boston — maintaining her connection with
this periodical for seven years. She was
then transferred to the more difficult position
of editor of the three juvenile papers of the
denomination — Our Diiyxpring, for young peo-
ple; The Myrtle, for children; and Our Myrtle
Buds, for the little tots. The first antl last
were originated by her, and all three were
under her sole management, their success fully
attesting the tact and versatility, little short
of genius, that are absolutely necessary to an
editor of children's papers.

These periodicals were, in truth, the heralds
of the great movement among young people
that was soon to sweep with such beneficent
results over the church life of all denomiiuitions;
and Miss Perkins was speedily called upon
to assume the great but inspiring responsibilities



458



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



of a pioneer in this world-wide movement by
organizing and directing the young people's
work of her denomination, the first young
people's society of any denomination being
organized in a Free Baptist church.

The six years that followed proved that
she had inherited her father's capacity to
serve a great cause with boundless energy
and enthusiasm. Into this brief period was
crowded a phenomenal amount of labor;
for to the duties of editorshiji there was added
the exacting work of a general secretary,
which included travelling, arranging for and
addressing conventions, organizing new so-
cieties, and carrying on a vast amount of
correspondence. It was in the days before
the word "strenuous" hatl attained to its
present hard-worketl prominence, but her life
at this time amply merited the term. It
was also somewhat unusual for a woman to
wield great influence from the platform, but
as a speaker Miss Perkins possessed the rare
combination of magnetism, grace, and sym-
pathy that were their own best justification.

She was greatly beloved and loyally fol-
loweil by the host of young people whom
she had organized into a splendid working
force, but the long-continued strain of the
combined duties of secretary and .editor finally
made a vacation of at least a year imperative.
Before the year was over, however, she re-
ceived an unexpected and flattering invitation
to become preceptress of the New Englanil
Conservatory of Music, located in Boston.
This position she retained for six years, until
the removal of the Conservatory, in 1902,
to its present building on Huntington Avenue
of the same city. A change in the school
management altered her ilutics somewhat,
but she is still connected with the Conserv-
atory (1904), and retains her official title.
During the year 1903 she again evinced her
versatility by making a systematic catalogue
of the rare musical scores and other valuable
volumes of the Conservatory Library.

Her work at the Conservatory, although
directed in a somewhat different channel,
has been logically a continuation of her life
of service for young people. The organization
of the Conservatory Young Women's Christian



Association, which has brought the school
into affiliation with the great Christian student
movement among the colleges, was due entirely
to her influence, and she has continued quietly
active in its behalf. Her general culture,
her wide experience, her intuitive symjiathy,
and her rich endowment of idealism have
admirably fitted her to be the friend and coun-
sellor of young women, and no girl has ever
appealed to her in vain for advice, or comfort,
or "mothering." The young in heart are
always beloved, and this tribute of love has
followed her wherever she has gone. The
fragrance of such a life as hers is like that
of the alabaster box of precious ointment —
which has ever been the symbol of unselfish
service and devotion.

MARY STONE BURNHAM.— It has
been well said : " It is as difficult to
write a faithful biography as to paint
a true portrait. The artist gives
form, line, color, and a phase of life and ex-
pression. The biographer gives country, line-
age, personal appearance, deeds; but the better
part of life, the incentive, is as hard to catch,
as delicate to transcribe, as the soul is to im-
prison on canvas." The incentive in the life of
Mrs. Burnham, it may well be said, is a deep-
rooted generosity, which has prompted her to
carry out the principle she has adopted, "Let
me share my portion with others."

Mary Stone Burnham (born Stone) is a native
of Maine. Her earlj^ years were passed at the
home of her parents in South Paris, that
State. She was educated for a teacher at the
Farmington State Normal School, and before
her marriage to Josiah Burnham, of Portland,
was successfully engaged in the duties of her
])rofession. Interest in school work and ability
to discover the best methods of meeting the
needs of pupils caused her to be a tower of
strength when the work of schoolroom decora-
tion was begun in Porthmd.

Early in January, 1897, an informal tea was
given by Mrs. George C. Frye to the commit-
tee on this work, club presidents, and associate
members, at which time suggestions as to ways



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



459



and means were presentetl. A fortnight later
an appeal was made to the citizens of Port-
land through the colunms of her papers to assist
in this good work. The co-operation of the
school board was secured, and a committee of
nine, chosen from the Woman's Literary Union,
with Mrs. Burnham as its chairman, began
work.

So great was their energy that in May of the
same year Reception Hall, City Building, was
thrown open to the public for the inspection of
the pictures and casts, more than seventy in
number, which were to be presented to the
public schools. At these presentation exer-
cises Superintendent Lord presided, the Hon.
J. W. Symonds delivered an admirable address,
and Mrs. Burnham gave an accurate and in-
teresting history of the work dolie by the com-
mittee. She said: "Our aim has not been the
purchase of pictures just because they are pict-
ures, but pictures with a purpose and of ac-
knowledged merit. All pictures are not suit-
able. The fact of its being a masterpiece does
not make it appropriate for the school-room.
A Madonna teaches a higher ideal of woman-
hood than a Bacchante, though both may be
on the same artistic plane."

In conclusion, she pre.sented, on behalf of the
Woman's Literary Union, this entire collection
to the schools of Portland. Mayor Randall ac-
cepted the gift in behalf of the school commit-
tee and city government. For the first time
the citizens of Portland realized in some degree
the magnitude and desirability of the work.

Mrs. Burnham remained chairman of this
committee for two years. Upon her resigna-
tion she was made an honorary member. As
such, she yet put her shoulder to the wheel
and assumed full care of this work in the North
School. She has left no stone unturned to
advance the progress of the project. She has
solicited subscriptions, aroused interest in un-
expected quarters, written and delivereil lect-
ures, and has personally presented some work
of art to every school building in the city. In
her kindly rounds of duty she has been quick
to notice opportunities for better arrangement
and grouping, and the adoption of her sugges-
tions has resulted in many improvements.

Mrs. Burnham was also a pioneer in the club



movement in Maine, having been a member of
the Travellers' Club ever since its formation in
1882. In this club she has held various offices.
She was the third president of the Woman's
Literary Union of Portland, auditor of the
State FVderation, and she served on the Board
of Trustees of the Invalids' Home.

In many quiet, unobtrusive ways she shares
her privileges, her possessions, and her time
with others. Mrs. Burnham has a great ca-
pacity for winning friends, and in her charming
home she exercises a gracious hospitality. She
has always been a student of the best books,
and has had the advantage of foreign travel.



ELLEN MARIA STONE, missionary
teacher, was born in Roxbury, Mass.,
July 24, 1846, daughter of Benjamin F.
and Lucy (Waterman) Stone. Miss
Stone comes of sturdy New England stock,
being descended from ancestors, on both sides,
who were willing to serve their country and
their God with all their being, not hesitating
to risk their lives, if neetl be, in the defence
of the principles of their government or of
their religion.

On her father's side she claims descent from
Gregory Stone, who, with his wife Lydia, came
from Suffolk County, England, about 1636,
and settled in Cambridge, Mass. His brother
Simon had preceded him to this country,
settling in Watertown. Gregory Stone was
a member of the Colonial Legion, and his name
appears in volume one of the Provincial
Records.

Miss Stone's great-grandfather on the pa-
ternal side, Eliphalet Stone, of Marlbor-
ough, N.H., was one of the leading citizens of
that town, taking a prominent part in public
affairs. He served in the Revolutionary War.
His son Shubael, Miss Stone's grandfather,
enlisted in the same regiment toward the
close of the war. The latter also served in
the War of 1812, as captain of a company which
he recruited. Miss Stone's mother, who is
now in her ninety-secontl year, distinctly re-
members re-unions of this company, with dinner
served on the lawn at the homestead in Mail-
borough, in which town she lived as a bride.



460



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



The wife of Shubael Stone was Polly Rogers,
of an old New England family. Miss Stone
also claims descent, through her maternal
grandmother, Lucy Waterman Barker, from
the doughty Pilgrim warrior, Captain Myles
Standish.

Benjamin Franklin Stone, father of the
subject of this sketch, inherited the military
tastes of his family. During his early man-
hood he was connected with the militia of
New Hampshire and Massachusetts, being a
member of the Norfolk Guard, afterward
known as the Roxbury City Guard, during
his residence in that town. The sole surviving
niemlKT of the Marlixirougii family of tiiirteen
children is Mrs. Julia R. Towne, of Evanston,
111.

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War Miss
Stone's two eldest brothers, true to the tra-
ditions of their family, enlisted, ami served
three years each, the eldest, George Franklin,
in the Army of the Potomac, and the second,
Edwin Cornelius, in the navy, where he was
assigned to the frigate "Minnesota," and was
on her when she had her narrow escape from
destruction by the enemy's i-am, the " Merri-
mac," before the "Monitor" appeared upon the
scene. After completing his term of service
in the navy, this second brother enlisted in
the army, responding to the call for three
months' men.

The brave father hardly lield his patriotic
soul in leash in deference to the importmiities
of his wife that he remain with her and their
three youngest children, until the government
issued a call for nine months' men, when he
could be held back no longer. He enlisted
in Company K, Forty-third Massachusetts
Infantry, and saw service at Newbern and
Little Washington, N.C. His daughter cher-
ishes as one of her choicest treasures the little
volume of the New Testament and Psalms
which she saw presented to her father, together
with all his comrades of the regiment, by their
Chaplain, the Rev. J. M. Manning, D.D.,
pastor of the Old South Church, Boston, at
a farewell service held in the First Congrega-
tional Church, Chelsea, before their departure
for the seat of war. It was Corporal Stone's
custom to carry this book in his breast-pocket.



and after he had been honorably discharged
from the service, and was once more in the
midst of his family, he told the story of his
deliverance from deadly peril in battle, and
showed his Testament with its cover torn and
twisted by the spent minie-ball, which had been
arrested by it. A brave, fearless man was he,
prompt to respond to every call of duty, and
fully persuaded that man is immune from
harm as long as God has need of him. The
father and his two sons returned home upon
the expiration of their term of service, uninjured.

Ellen Maria Stone was educated in the elemen-
tary branches in Roxbury schools, and after
1S6() in the grannnar and higii schools of Chelsea.
After graduating from the latter, she taught
.school for a while in Chelsea (1866-67). From
1(S67 to 1878 she was on the editorial staff of
the Congref/ationalist. Deeply imbued with
religious feeling, she sought earnestly to pro-
mote the kingdom of God, taking especial
interest in foreign missions, to which work
she ultimately felt herself called. This con-
viction with her meant action. Making known
her desires, and being found well fitted for the
work by reason of her earnestness and energy,
educational qualifications, and religious de-
votion, she was appointed in 1878, by the
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, as missionary to Bulgaria, for which
country she sailed after an affecting leave-
taking of her many friends and well-wishers.
The circumstances in connection with her
capture b\' brigands, September 3, 1901, on a
mountain road in Macedonia, and her subse-
quent detention by them for nearly six months,
pending the payment of her ransom, it will be
remembered, were given wide newspaper pub-
licity, and, as narrated by herself, may be
found in MrClure's Magazine, May-October,
1902. The following estimate of her work
and character is quoted from an article written
by her personal friend, Mrs. Otis Atwood, of
Chelsea, while Miss Stone was still a prisoner
among the brigands: —

"We met in the early sixties, as schoolmates
in the Shurtleff Grammar School, then, and
for many years after, under the leadership of
Miss Elizabeth G. Hoyt. How large a part
this teacher had in the formation of the noble



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



461



character of her pupil cannot be estimated,
but Miss Stone herself has often referred to
the principles of truth, so firmly instilled by
this faithful teacher, as the groundwork of all her
her future usefulness. . . .

"As a school-girl, Ellen Stone was a leader.
She had but one rival in the honor for the
'first seat' as the head of the class, when the
monthly adding of the 'credits' by the pupils
them.selves assigned positions. A favorite be-
cause of her many lovable ((ualities, all rejoiced
in her honors. These were the days of the
Civil War, when patriotism ran high; and
well miglit she, whose father and two brothers
were at the front, lead her schoolmates in de-
votion and loyalty to her country's flag. The
day for her graduation was at hand. Ex-
aminations had been passed with high per
cent., and her part in the literary exercises
was to declaim a patriotic poem by Elizabeth
Browning: —

'Dead! both my boys!
One of them shot by the sea in the East,
One of them shot in the West by the sea.

Dead! both my boys!
If in keeping the feast
You want a great song for your Italy free,
Let none look at me ! Let none look at me ! '

And then welled up the great heart of that
Italian mother in such expressions of patriotism,
beyond her grief, that none could read and not
be stirred to the heart's depths. Ellen felt
that the lofty thoughts were beyond her power
to portray, but she accepted the trust; and
those who heard her voice ring out over the
multitude which filleil the old City Hall to the
doors, can never forget the inspiration to loyalty
in their own country's cause, received from the
young declaimer.

" Her course through the high school was
marked by the same devotion to duty, the
same high ideals; yet so unassuming, so be-
loved by all, she never seemed to realize that
she was a marked scholar, the pride of her
teachers and of the visiting school-board.

"Immediately upon her graduation she was
installed as one of the teachers, iloing faithful
work, until called to another position of honor
and trust, as one of the assistant editors of the



Congregntionalist, with especial charge of the
church news, children's department, poetry,
and the missionary department. This edu-
cation doubtless had much to do with her
future leading, for it was not till long afterward,
when she had really had her call to mission-
ary work, and offered her services to the Board,
that she knew her praying mother had con-
secrated her to this work at her birth, and again
at her baptism.

"We have been told by her brother that
she inherited the missionary spirit from both
father and mother, but that her special 'call'
came through a sermon [ireached by the late
Dr. Alden, her friend. Miss Susan B. Higgins,
being led to the same wOrk by the same sermon.
"During these days of girlhooti and young
womanhooil her spiritual life had kept pace
with the intellectual. Sitting under the teach-
ing of her beloved pastor. Dr. Albert Plumb,
she gave her heart wholly and unreservedly
to the Saviour. 'I shall never forget the
moment,' she told the writer, one evening in
the vestry of the dear old church, ' when His
voice called, and I answered. We were singing
' Just as I am without one plea, but that Thy
blood was shed for me,' and with my whole
heart I cried, '0 Lamb of God, I come.'

" Up to that time she had lived like many
another young life, doing 'the duty nearest,'
yet with no definite aim for a life-work. 'As
if he knew my need,' she told a friend, ' Dr.
Plumb preached a sermon right to my soul,
from the text, " Unstable as water, thou shalt
not excel." ' Henceforward to serve Christ and
to lead souls into His kingdom was her one
undeviating purpose."

Some years of earnest Christian work in the
church and Sunday-school followed, years of
happy memory to tho.se who were privileged
to be her ])Ui)ils. "Not only little children,
but young men and maidens felt the irresistil)le
power of Christ that shone from her face, voice,
and personality; and her pastor, Dr. Addison
P. Foster (successor of Dr. Plumb), found in
her a valuable helpmeet in guiding and instruct-
ing young Christians who asked admission to
the church during a powerful revival under
his ministry. ... It was a marvel that out of
her busy life she found so much time to visit



462



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



the sick, the disheartened, the suffering and
bereaved — ^an angel of mercy, indeed, in many
a home. No wonder that her 'call' brought
(.lismay and gric&gt;f to many hearts."

In September, 1878, two farewell meetings
were held, which were notable events: the
first, in the Walimt Street Methodist Episcopal
Church, was for Miss Higgins, who had been
appointed by the Methodist Board, to Yoko-
hama, Japan; the second was for Miss Stone,
in her home church, the First Congregational.

" A young pastor (the Rev. Jutlson Tits-
worth) had just been installed as pastor of
the First Church. The impressive services
seemed to him God's special benediction upon
his ministry; and" when, during Mi,ss Stone's
farewell words to her own people, she reached
forth her hand and called her young sister to
herself to give her the right hand of fellowship,
as together they promised to give their lives
to the saving of souls, there was scarcely a
dry eye in the church. The pastor arose,
stantling with bowetl head. As he afterward
said: 'I felt that I stood on holy ground.
I knew .something how Moses felt when in the
presence of the burning bush. I knew that
God was there.'

" Within a few days both had started for
their appointed fields, one toward the East
and one to the West. As we count time, Miss
Higgins's earthly service was short, for in eight
months she had entered into her heavenly
home; but in the sight of the Father her
work still goes on in her influence, which lives
in hundreds of hearts to-day. And, if we can
judge by results, her mantle must have fallen
on Miss Stone, for an added spirituality and
fervor entered into her life, resulting in many
ingatherings to the kingdom of Christ. . . .

"On reaching Samokov, Bulgaria, to which
place Miss Stone was a.ssigned, she entered
upon her duties in the Boarding-school for
Girls, as assistant to Miss E. T. Maltbie, teach-
ing English branches, while learning the new
and difficult language.

" It seemed to the writer an incredibly short
time when word came, ' Mi.ss Stone has conducted
her first prayer-meeting in Bulgaria.' We
soon learned that Bulgarian hearts were as
susceptible to the power of Christ in one's



life, as Americans, and that her influence was
most truly telling for His name. The same
lovable traits of character so potent in America
won the hearts of her young pupils, enabling
her to lead them to their Saviour, as, with
the other devoted missionaries of the station,
she had her part in a most gratifying revival,
that followed not many months after her coming
to Bulgaria.

"After becoming familiar with the language,
her field of usefulness widened, as the Board
then appointed her superintendent of the
'Bible women,' who taught in the towns and
villages of the country, that younger children
(than the pupils at the boarding-school) and
their mothers should be reached. These were
native Bible women, converts to the Christian
faith, and were in many cases gratluates from
the school, who desired to prove the reality
of their conversion in service. Their duty
was to gather the children of the village into
a school (held perhaps in one of the rooms of
some humble home), to teach the common
studies and the Bible, also to hold a Sunday-
school for the children, prayer-meetings with
the mothers, as well as to perform many pas-
toral duties."

As these workers were appointed by and
were under the instruction and guidance of
Miss Stone, she visited them at regular in-
tervals. Said Mrs. Atwood: "It is from other
than Miss Stone's pen that we learn of the
delight at her coming, the joy of the children
who own her as 'Avmtie Stone,' and the great
honor they count as theirs when she can be
the guest at their homes. As Bulgaria is a
country of 'magnificent distances,' these visits
necessitate many tours over the mountains
and plains, at the cost of great fatigue and
dangers. But our friend ' counts it all gain,' as
she has noted from year to year the glorious
results, in the change from gross superstition,
persecution, and ignorance, to the character
of faithful, earnest followers of the 'meek and
lowly Jesus.' "

When Miss Stone entered into this larger
work, her home was at Philippopolis, but in
1898, the increase in her work, and the call from
Macedonia, "Come over and help us," caused
the Board to assign her to Salonica, the ancient



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



463



Thessalonica of the time of Saint Paul. Here,
associated with Dr. House and Messrs. Baird
and Haskell and their families, she carried
on a noble work in that city, which in-
cluded many conversions among the sailors
from the British fleet, anchored for a time in
Salonica Harbor. Miss Stone hatl heroically
endured the heat of a Salonican summer, with
the exception of one trip to Samokov, and had
been to Bansko for a three weeks' training-
school with her Bible women, when on return-
ing thence, with an unusually large company of
workers, she was seized by brigands. Her cap-
tivity and final release on payment of a large
ransom, to which we have already referred, are
matters familiar to the reading public. Since
her return home, some part of her time has
been given to lecturing on missionary subjects,
including her own personal experience in the
missionary field. She is at present living
quietly in Clielsea, Mass., devoting all her
time to her aged mother.



1IZABETH A. TURNER, Past National
President of the Woman's Relief Corps
J and chairman of the board of directors
of the Ander.sonville Prison property,
is known throughout the country as a leader
in patriotic work. Her paternal grandfather,
John Thompson, was in the battle of Bunker
Hill, and later was in the army stationed at
Valley Forge. Her parents were Charles and
Betsey Thompson, of Windsor, Conn., and until
her marriage she was known as Lizabeth A.
Thomp.son. She was educated in the public
schools of her native town, now Windsor Hills.

In 1857 she was married to Y. F. L. Turner,
of Georgia. Mr. Turner died three years later,
and was laid to rest in the old cemetery at
P(,rtland, Me.

At the breaking out of the Civil War Mrs.
Turner was a resident of Boston. She packed
the first box of supplies forwarded from that
city to the soldiers at the front, and in 1863 she
was a constant visitor to the hospital in Pem-
berton Square, where the wounded sent from
the battle-fiekls of the South received the
kindest care.

On the 17th of March, 1880, Mrs. Turner was



admitted to membership in Major-General
H. G. Berry Relief Corps, of Maiden, and was
initiated by Mrs. E. Florence Barker, with
whom she was subsequently associated as one
of the pioneers of the National Woman's Relief
Corps. Mrs. Turner held various offices in the
corps at Maiden, and was its President two
years. At the annual convention of the De-
partment of Massachusetts, W. R. C, in 1883,
she was elected to the office of Conductor. She
was Jvmior Mce-President in 1884 and 1885 and
Senior \' ice-President in 1886-87. In 1888 she
declined to accept the honor of Department
President, but consented to .serve as chairman
of the Executive Board. In 1892, after three
years in this office, she was appointed Counsellor
by Mrs. Mary G. Deane, Department President.

Mrs. Turner has addressed numerous posts,
corps, conventions, and other patriotic gather-
ings in all parts of the State. She is' especially
popular as an installing officer and as a member
of committees where executive ability is re-
quired.

In 1883, when the National Woman's Relief
Corps was organized at the National Encamp-
ment of the Grand Army in Denver, Col., Mrs.
Turner, who rendered invaluable service in
securing the adoption of the Massachusetts
work and ritual, was elected National Treasurer.
She was re-elected seven years in succession,
during which time she managed the finances
with great ability. She was elected chairman
of the National Executive Board in 1889 and
National Senior Vice-President in 1890, when
the convention was held in Tremont Temple,
Boston.

She was treasurer of the Executive Committee
of Arrangements for this convention and chair-
man of the Committee on Accommodations.

In 1891 Mrs. Turner was invited to be a can-
didate for the office of National President, but
declined. She consentetl, however, in 1895, and
was unanimou.sly elected that year at the con-
vention in Louisville, Ky. She established
headquarters at 29 Temple Place, Boston. The
work of her administration met with universal
approval. In the address which she presented
to the annual convention at St. Paul, Minn.,
over which she presided in 1896, referring to
patriotic teaching, she said: ''This is one of

the fundamental laws of our order. In fact,
it is one of the strongest planks in the
Woman's Relief Corps platform. Our success-
ful work along that line for the last four years
has been even greater than the most enthusi-
astic workers ever anticipated."

She made an extended Southern tour during
her year as National President, visiting the
colored corps, and also going to Andersonville,
in order to find out something definite about
the place and its surroundings.

It being decided at this convention to assume
control of the Andersonville Prison property,
a board of directors was chosen, of which Mrs.
Turner was elected chairman. Two years later,
in reporting the work accomplished, Mrs. Turner
said: "We now own all the stockade as well as
all the earthworks and forts surrounding it.
Suitable gates have been erected in all places
needed except at the main entrance. A wide
driveway has been cut around the grounds, just
inside the fence, and wide gates erected at the
north-east corner, that open out to a plantation
road leading to the National Cemetery, one
quarter of a mile away, where our heroes lie
buried. Two bridges have been built over the
creek, so that now one can drive the entire cir-
cuit of our land, two and three-fifths miles.

"The forts all remain intact, and are covered
with a growth of fine forest trees. . . . We have
built a nine-room house, at a cost of over seven-
teen hundred dollars, and put up a wire fence
with gates, at a cost of five hundred and sixty-
seven dollars; planted the prison pen with Ber-
muda grass roots at an expense of one hundred
and seventeen dollars; paid out in small sums,
for extra help, tools, and sundries, about five
hundred more; also paid salary of care-taker
for seven months, and built two bridges."

After referring to the presentation of a flag-
pole worth one hundred and forty dollars by
Colony Corps and C'omrades of Fitzgerald, Ga.,
the gift of a flag from the Ex-prisoners of War
Association of Comiecticut, the furnishing in
oak of the guest chamber at the cottage by
members of corps in Massachusetts, and a do-
nation of one hvmdred dollars raised through
the efforts of Mrs. Emma R. Wallace, of Illi-
nois, a member of the board, Mrs. Turner stated
that not one cent had been taken from the



national treasury for all the work accomplished
at Andersonville. She recommended that one
thousand dollars be donated from the general
fun&lt;l and placed in the Andersonville Prison
Fund for the use of the board in completing
the work mentioned in the report. Previous
to the adoption of this recommendation, all
the work had been conducted by voluntary
contribution.

Mrs. Turner entered into this work with great
enthusiasm. In her report at the convention
in Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 1901, she
said: "Within the last two years over two hun-
dred pecan trees have been set out, and they
are growing finely. The pecan industry of
Georgia will be a close rival to the orange trade
of Florida and, I believe, with better results,
as we have no fear of frosts. I firmly believe
the place can be made more than self-supporting
by planting the ground with pecan trees. Ohio
and Massachusetts will this fall put up hand-
some monuments of granite inside the stockade
grounds, in honor of their loyal sons who died as
prisoners of war. Pennsylvania has made an
appropriation for a monument, and other States
are agitating the matter.

"The most important work of the past year
has been the erection of the pavilion over Provi-
dence Spring and its dedication."

In addition to her efforts for the improvements
at Andersonville, Mrs. Turner performed the
duties of National Counsellor from September,
1900, to September, 1901.

The movement in behalf of a Soldiers' Home
in Massachusetts enlisted her sympathies, and
she was one of the leaders in the bazaar held
for that object in Mechanics' Building, Boston,
in December, 1881. One of the attractions of
the bazaar was a military album, containing
autographs of President Lincoln and the orig-
inal war Cabinet, besides the signatures of
prominent generals and other leaders in the
civil conflict and in the Revolution. It netted
one thousand dollars to the fund, and is now
treasured in the library of the Loyal Legion of
Massachu,setts. The autographs were collected
and arranged by Mrs. Turner.

She is one of the founders of the Ladies'
Aid Association of the Soldiers' Home, auxil-
iary to the Board of Trustees, and is a regu-

lar contributor to the home, which she often
visits. She has served continuously in some
official capacity — as chairman of large com-
mittees for fairs, Memorial Day and other
special work, as a member of the Board of Di-
rectors, and as one of the Mce-Presidents. A
room bearing her name has been furnished by
the Department of Massachusetts, W. R. C,
and contains her portrait. Abraham Lincoln
Corps of Charlestown, of which she has been a
member the past eleven years, has placed her
picture in Department headquarters, Boylston
Building, Boston. Contribution.s of money for
the portrait were sent this corps by friends and
corps throughout the State.

Mr.s. Turner is a model financier, and her
.services as treasurer of large charitable enter-
prises are in great demand.

She is deeply interested in all the posts of
the Grand Army of the Republic, and has many
frienils among the comrades in all parts of the
country, for they appreciate her grantl work in
their behalf. In her collection of valuable gifts
are a framed testimonial from Major-general
H. G. Berry Post, No. 40, of Maiden, Mass., a
costly badge and framed testimonial from Atl-
miral Foote Post, of New Haven, Conn., given
her in acknowledgment of gavels presented them
by her, which were made of wood from Anderson-
ville Prison and from the tree untler which
General Lee surrendered at Appomattox. The
gift to the Maiden post was accompanieil by
the re(|uest that it should be i)resente(l to the
Maiden City Library when the post should cease
to exist.

Mrs. Turner was a member of the Executive
Committee of Arrangements for the National
Convention in Boston, Augu.st 15-20, 1904,
chairman of the Badge Committee, also chair-
man of the Accommodation Committee ant!
a member of other conmiittees.

Her recommendation that one thousand
dollars be appropriated annually for the per-
petual care of the historic grounds at Ander-
■sonviile was adopted at this convention.

Although not a near kin.swoman of any soldier
of the Civil War, she has given her best efforts
to the cause represented by the Union veteran,
and is recognized as one of the ablest of the loyal
women of the Relief Corps.



HELENA HIGGINBOTHAM.— Among
the authors who have recently made
their bow to the public, and who
have met with instant appreciation,
is Helena Iligginbothani, of Springfield, Mass.
She was born in Philadelphia in 1874, but came
as a tiny chikl to Massachusetts, since which
time her home has been in Huntington and
Springfield.

Her father, John Francis Higginbotham,
was born and reared in Manchester, England;
while her mother, Helen Hazelhurst Higgin-
botham, was of Spanish origin.

After a three years' cour.se at the Spring-
field High School, MLss Higginbotham, who
from childhood had .shown much talent for
sketching, took the two years' course in draw-
ing at the Cowles Art School, Boston, later
attending the Art Students' League in New
York. Nature has endowed Miss Higgin-
botham generously with mental and physical
gifts. When a little girl she sketched with
ease, and in occasional fits of petulance ea.sed
her injured feelings by making quick carica-
tures of tho.se who had offended her. These
were .so clever that the subjects, instead of
feeling re.sentful, were lost in admiration. It
was as easy for her to use her pen as her cray-
ons; and, though too shy for a long time to
offer her literary work, she gradually began
contributing to newspapers and magazines.
In Septemlx'r, 1902, Lee &amp; Shepard published
her book, "Rover's Story," which she had il-
lustrated herself. She has another volume
in progress, and intends to make literature
her profession. Some of the articles contributed
by her to magazines are not what might be
considered of a literary nature, most of them
being on mechanical subjects, such as wiring
hou.ses for electric bells and for lighting gas
by an electrical current. In electrical engi-
neering she takes a great interest, and her arti-
cles on this subject are ba.sed upon personal
experience. She .says in regard to it : " Having
wired nine houses, and after keeping them in
repair without the aid of an electrician, I have
found the occujiation far more interesting than
literature, even if one does have to climb lad-
ders to fasten insulators above the second-
story windows, to attach the outside wires,

or go down cellar among the cobwebs to make
' grounds,' set up batteries, and all the rest
incidental to the l)usiiiess."

Miss Higginbotham is intensely fond of
chiklren and animals, and in all she writes
there is a wholesome, happy flavor. Bright
and vivacious in manner and of a gracious
personality, she makes an instant and favor-
able impression upon those with whom she
comes into contact, who preserve pleasing
recollections of her apt and interesting con-
versation.



FANNY TITUS HAZEN, President of
the Massachusetts Army Nurse Asso-
ciation, is a native of Vershire, Vt.
She was born May 9, 1840, being the
eldest of eleven children of Simeon Bacon
and Eliza Jane (Morris) Titus. Her parents
are now living at her home in Cambridge,
Mass., her father being eighty-five years old
and her mother eighty-four. Mrs. Hazen's
paternal granilfather was Joseph Titus, born
in Royalston, Mass., son of Lenox Titus, of
Royalston, who marched to the relief of Ben-
nington during the Revolution. Her maternal
grandfather, William Morris, was clerk of the
military company which marched from the
town of Woodstock, Conn., on the Lexington
alarm, April, 1775. He served in this capacity
only ten days. Appointed on March 7, 1778,
Second Lieutenant in Captain Daniel Til-
den's company, he served as Quartermaster in
Colonel Sanuiel McLellan's regiment, which
enlisted for one year's service from March,
1778. The official record says: this regiment
"appears to have enlisted in Tyler's brigade
under Sullivan in Rhode Island, August —
September, 1778."

Fanny Titus attended school when three
years of age, walking a mile to the school-
house and never missing a session during the
term. She had already been taught the
alphabet by her grandmother Titus, and could
spell words with two syllables. When five
years old she studied with great interest
Peter Parley's geography. She frequently
accompanied her father in his journeyings
of many miles through the Vermont hills.



At the age of seven she often drove seven
miles to the mill with a load of wheat, waited
until it was ground, and then took it home.
In the spelling matches which were popular
in those days she "spelled down" the entire
school, although the youngest contestant.
Before she was seven she was taught to spin,
and was well drilled in all branches of do-
mestic work. Just before she was thirteen
she travelled alone to the home of her grand-
mother Morris in Lawrence, Mass., going by
stage.

While living at her grandmother's in Law-
rence she attended the Oliver Grammar School,
always, before starting for school at eight
o'clock, washing the breakfast dishes for
forty boarders. This task she performed
daily for more than a year. By invitation
of the school conmiittee of her native town
she then returned thither and taught until
she was eighteen. As a teacher she was very
successful, introducing the advanced methods
she had learned in Lawrence. Going again
to Lawrence in 1858, she found employment
in one of the large mills, reserving one even-
ing each week for herself and one for the
church. She was interested in the Free
Baptist church of that city, of which she
became a member at the age of seventeen,
being baptized in the Merrimack River. The
work in the mill was not so congenial to her
as teaching, but its financial results were
better. Leaving the mill on account of an
accident, she remainetl in Lawrence antl took
up dressmaking, being thus engaged at the
beginning of the Civil War.

Her eldest brother, James M. Titus, enlisted
in 1861 in t^ie Fourth Vermont Regiment,
was wounded at Gettysburg, July, 1863, antl
in the same year died of disease at W^arren
Station, Va. In November, 1863, two younger
brothers, Morris P., eighteen years old, and
Joseph L., .seventeen, having enlisted in the
Fourth Vermont, Fanny returned to the
old home in Vershire to spend Thanksgiving
with them and to say farewell. They left
the next day for the front. Morris was taken
prisoner at Cold Harbor and sent to Anderson-
ville, and was exchanged in the fall of 1864.
He died in December, 1900. Joseph was



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



467



wounded in the head at the battle of Cold
Harbor, Va., 1864, and died the following Feb-
ruary in a field hospital, after returning to
duty from a furlough home.

Yearning to be helpful to her country in
its time of peril, Fanny Titus offered her
services to the Sanitary and also to the Chris-
tian Commission, but the officials of both
replied, "You are too young." And so said
Dr. Hayward, of Boston, adding, "It would
be of no use to send you: Miss Dix would send
you right back." She secured letters of
reference from the Rev. George H. Hepworth,
pastor of the Church of the Unity, Boston,
and from Dr. Steadman and Dr. Willard,
of Boston, and the last of March, 1864, went
to Washington. Her first call was at the
office of Surgeon-general Hammond, who said
it would be useless for her to see Miss Dix,
but gave her some encouragement, how-
ever, by promising his endorsement if any
surgeon in charge of a hospital would give
her a position. This would place her on
record as a regularly enrolled army nurse.
Dr. Bliss, of the Armory Square Hospital,
shortly promised to give her the care of a
ward as soon as the new barracks were built.
While waiting for this appointment, she im-
proved the time by visiting hospitals. She
also .sought a conference with Miss Dix, and,
being kindly received, spoke of her brothers
— the eldest of whom had given his life for
his country, the other two being then with
the Vermont brigade in V^irginia — and of
her desire to care for the sick and wounded
soldiers. After listening to her story and
reatling her letters. Miss Dix asked her several
questions, one being in regard to the amount
of baggage she had brought from home. She
replied, "A large and a small valise." Miss
Dix commended her good sense in taking so
little, and added: "Child, I shall not say no,
though it is entirely against my rules to take
any one so young. I believe your heart is
in the work, and that I can trust you. I
shall send my ambulance to-morrow morning
to take you to Columbian Hospital, there
to remain in quarters till I send you to Annapolis.
In the meantime you will be under the train-
ing of Miss Burghardt. I have so instructed



Major Crosby." Columbian Hospital was
on Fourteenth Street, Washington, and was
in charge of Dr. Thomas R. Crosby. Shortly
after. Miss Burghardt having been granted a
furlough for rest, she was placetl in temporary
care of her ward, the surgeon of which was Dr.
F. H. Marsh, of Michigan. By request of Dr.
Crosby she was retained at the Columbian Hos-
pital, and upon the return of Miss Burghardt
was assigned to Ward Two, where she remained
until June 27, 1865, when the hospital was
closed.

Her experiences while in charge of this
ward have been recorded by Mrs. Hazen
in the history of "Our Army Nurses." She
thus refers to the summer of 1864: "The
hospital was filled in May with wounded
from the Wilderne.ss. Then came the battle
at Spottsylvania and June 1 the battle of Cold
Harbor. From the latter battle-field my
youngest brother was brought to my ward.
At the first I was so rejoiced to see him alive
I did not feel sorry that he had been wounded.
After each arrival from the front all who
could be moved were transferred to hospitals
more remote, to make room for the next
arrivals from the battle-fields, until at last
the wards were filled with very badly wounded
men, some soon crossing to the other shore,
others lingering for months, suffering untold
agonies ere the longed-for rest came. Still
others lived to carry through life crippled
bodies. Many were the letters written for
tho.se unable to write to tlie dear father, mother,
brother, sister, or sweetheart, and many the
letters received with thanks from the absent
friends.

" During June, July, August, and September
our heads, hands, and hearts were taxed to
the utmost. . . . There were many deaths,
each one, as the last hours came, saying:
'Oh, please. Miss Titus, stay with me. It
will be but a short time. You seem so like
a sister.' So hour after hour I watched the
life-light flicker and tlie of many noble men
whose lives were a sacrifice for their country. . . .
Later we had our bright ilays, too, when wit
and song prevailed, and occasionally had time
to make (as the boys said) 'pies and other
things like what we hatl at home.' The boys



468

would bring the tables from the rooms, placing
them end to end through the hall, making
a long table, where all the men able to leave
their beds sat down to a home-like meal."

Mrs. Hazen relates the case of Sergeant
Eli Hudson, of Pennsylvania, who was wounded
in the knee in the spring of 1865. He was
a mere boy, but had served over four years,
and had for several months been a patient
in her ward. The surgeons hail held several
consultations, l)ut he was failing rapidly,
his disease being hemorrhage of the stomach.
When the verdict was given that he could
live but a few flays, Mrs. Hazen asked per-
mission to give him what he wanted to eat
while he lived; and the doctor surrendered
the entire charge of him to her care. She
says : " I at once removed the bandages, as
he complained that they were uncomfortable.
As soon as the patients were all cared for,
I went to a market-garden and bought a
head of cabbage. He had often said he
wanted something green. When the cabbage
was cooked, I carried him some with cider
vinegar. He ate all on the plate, asked for
more, which was brought, and still a third
and fourth plate, till he had eaten the whole
cabbage. From that dinner in May he began
to improve, and on the 14th of June I startefl
with Sergeant Hudson on a stretcher for his
home." He recovered, but had a stiff knee.

At this time the demand for lemons, jellies,
farina, and other delicacies was so great through-
out all the hos|)itals that the Sanitary and
Christian Connnissions' supplies were ex-
hausted. Mrs. Hazen, remembering that the
Rev. Dr. Hepworth had said to her, "If you
ever need hospital suiiplies, let Mrs. l^ird,
chairman of the Aid Society, know what is
needed, and we will .send direct to you,"
sent a letter to Mrs. Bird. This appeal was
received in Boston Saturday evening- and
read in Dr. Hejjworth's church the next day.
Before night three large boxes were filled and
started for Wa,shington. They contained
three hundred dollars' worth of supplies.
Mrs. Hazen received them with delight, dis-
tributing them not only to the boys in her
own ward, but to all the wards of Columbian
Hospital. She says: "The Aid Society also



.sent beautiful flannel shirts, socks, towels,
and everything to fit out all my boys when
able to return to the front. The girls? in the
Everett School, Boston, sent two barrels of
books through one of the teachers, Mrs. Emma
F'. W. Titus, many of them new publications,
purchased expressly for the soldiers."

Miss Dix visited the hospital every month,
and called all tlie nurses to meet her in the
matron's room. Mrs. Hazen pays the follow-
ing loving tribute to her memory: "She always
came for me, saying: 'Child, go quickly as
possible. Tell the nurses I wish to see them
without delay.' She was kind and thought-
ful for all, but very strict in enforcing all her
rules and regulations. She never wasted a
minute, and had no patience with those who
were slow. I shall ever remember Miss Dix
with the warmest love and gratitude, and
with the greatest reverence decorate her grave
in Mount Auburn every Memorial Day."

After returning from Washington at the
close of the war, being prevented on account
of poor health from going South to teach,
Miss Titus accepted a position in the grammar
school in North Chelsea, now known as Re-
vere, Mass. Caleb Richardson was the prin-
cipal of this school.

It was while accompanying Sergeant Hud-
son to his home, in June, 1865, as above noted,
that Miss Titus first met her future husband,
Charles Richard Hazen, a native of Hartford,
Vt. The wedding took place August 5, 1866,
at her home in Vershire, in the same room
in which she was born. Mr. Hazen enlisted
in the Nineteenth Massachusetts Infantry,
and served till April, 1864, when he was hon-
orably discharged. He was a military courier
connected with the United States Sanitary
Commission, his line of official duty being
from Washington, D.C., to Harrisburg, Pa.

Mr. and Mrs. Hazen lived in North An-
dover, Mass., for two years after their marriage
and in Lawrence the next four years. The
health of Mr. Hazen was impaired by his army
service, and by the atlvice of a physician
he followed the occupation of farming for
four years in Chelmsford, Mass., where they
bought the "Robbins Hill farm," the highest
elevation of land in that part of the State.



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



469



This propt'- y they afterward sold. In Sep-
tember, 1879, Mr. Hazen, being physically
unal:)le to continue farm work, engaged in
the provision business in Cambridgeport.
His invalitlism continuing and serious financial
losses following the removal to Cambridge,
Mrs. Hazen opened a dressmaking establish-
ment, and, as usual in her undertakings, met
with success. Dr. Turner, city physician of
Cambridge at this time, had been a ward
surgeon in the Columbian Hospital at Wash-
ington, and knew Mrs. Hazen's capabilities
as a business woman. Through the influence
of William H. Eveleth, superintendent of
grounds at Harvard College, she was given
entire charge of Divinity Hall, library and
grounds. This position she held for nine years.
She then purchased a spacious and pleasant es-
tate on Oxford Street, near the college build-
ings, in Cambridge, which has been their home
for the past fourteen years. She says, " I laiil
the foundation of my home by work before day-
light and by toiling hours after sundown."

Four children have been born to Mr. ami
Mrs. Hazen, and two are now living, namely:
Alma M., born May 12, 1868, in North An-
dover; and E. Roscoe, born June 5, 1878,
in Chelmsford. Alma M. married October
1, 1884, Mr. J. Ernest Conant, of West Somer-
ville, and lives in that city. Ernest Willard,
born in August, 1872, in Lawrence, died
before he was two years old, the result of an
accident; and Elbert Titus, born July 6, 1874,
in Chelmsford, died May 9, 1881.

Charles Beck Relief Corps, auxiliary to Post
No. 56, G. A. R., of Cambridge, was instituted
in July, 1879, and by invitation of Conunander
Stone of the post Mrs. Hazen joinetl the corps
at the next meeting. She has held office
therein continuously with the exception of
one year. She was elected president, but
declined to accept the jjosition. For the past
fourteen years she has been Chaplain, being
the unanimous choice of the members. Her
efficient work is appreciated by Post 56, as
well as the corps. She attended the annual
convention of the Woman's Relief Corps of
Massachusetts at East Boston in 1880, the
first State convention held after the formation
of the department. She has often partici-



pated in subsecjuent conventions, and has
served as Department Aide. In 1886 she
journeyed to California with the official party,
representing the Departments of Massachu-
setts, W. R. C, and in 1893 was a delegate to
Indianapolis. She has also attended other
National Conventions.

In 1896 the Massachusetts Army Nurse
As.sociation was formed at department heiul-
quarters, W. R. C, Boylston Building, Boston,
Mrs. Mary A. Livermore and other army nurses
participating. Mrs. Hazen was electetl Presi-
dent, and has been annually re-elected. Its
business meetings are held every month at
Grand Army headquarters, State House; and
public meetings of great interest are occasion-
ally held. The Army Nurse Fair, under the
management of Mrs. Hazen and her associates,
which was held in Boston, November, 1900,
netted a liberal sum to their treasury. A
grantl relief work is being conductetl by this
association, and its reunions are second only
in interest to those held by the "boys," to
whom they once ministered on battle-fields
and in hospitals. A record of army nurses
and material of value regarding their services
has been collected by the association.

Mrs. Hazen is a member of the Cambridge
Equal Suffrage League and (with the excep-
tion of one year) has voted for school com-
mittee ever since that privilege was granted
to women. She is also a member of the
Daughters of \'ermont. She is serving her
thinl year as Chaplain of Bunker Hill Chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolution.

Her life has been a busy and useful one.
Difficulties she has surmounted with a loyal,
courageous spirit, knowing no such word as
fail, especially when a good cause has appealed
to her for help. Needless to say of one so
friendly and faithful, she has many friends,
tender and true.



ELIZABETH BLODGETT FOSTER was
born at Belfast, Me., October 25, 1862.
Her father, Samuel Augustus Blodg-
ett, was interested in ship-building,
the principal industry of his time in that old
seaport town. Mrs. Elizabeth Bean Blodg-



470

ett, her mother, was a genuine New England
woman, much devoted to her family. She
was of Scottish descent.

Mrs. Foster was etlucated at the French
convent of Villa Marie, Montreal, and was
graduated there with honor in 1882, delivering
the valedictory in French. She was the winner
of the silver medal offered by the Marquis of
Lome as Governor-general of Canada, and
at a reception tendered him and his wife, the
Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria,
had the honor of presentation. She also re-
ceived a gold medal, called the Countess de
Borgia medal, for French conversation.

In 1884 she was united in marriage to Dr.
Barzillai B. Foster, a native of Unity, Me., and
a graduate of the Maine Medical School, con-
nected with Bowdoin College. The home of
Dr. and Mrs. Foster is in Portland, Me. They
have three sons.

Mrs. Foster has refined literary tastes, and
possesses a library of choice books. She is
a member of the Woman's Literary Union, of
Portland, and president of the Faneuil Club,
and is much interested in the charitable work
of the city.



EMILY LOUISE CLARK, National
Chaplain of the Woman's Relief Corps,
was born April 24, 1832, in Becket,
Mass., where her girlhood days were
passed. Her father was William A. Iline, a
native of England, and her mother was Hannah
Putnam, daughter of David Putnam.

At the age of eighteen years she was mar-
ried to Edwin Cook Clark, a native of North-
ampton, Mass., where, after a few years spent
in Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Southampton,
they have since lived. When the Civil War
began, they had three children, the youngest
only eleven months old. While unable to
leave her home to engage in work for the .sol-
diers, she resolved to perform her share of duty
in the great crisis of the nation. She opened
her house as a rendezvous for all who desired
to aid the Union cau.se, antl it was continually
thronged with people who were zealous in
working for the volunteers. Mrs. Clark con-
tinued her efforts until the close of the war,



and felt, when peace was declared, that the
"boys in blue" no longer needed her aid. It
was not long, however, before she realized
that, though the conflict was ended, the suf-
fering it caused remained. Her patriotic work
was continued, and when W. L. Baker Post,
No. 86, G. A. R., was organized at Northamp-
ton, Mrs. Clark entered heartily into plans for
its success. She was the first President of
W. L. Baker Relief Corps, auxiliary to Post
No. 86, which was instituted May 13, 1885,
and she was re-electeil two succe.ssive years.
At the Department Convention in 1887 she
was chosen a delegate to the National Con-
vention in St. Louis, and has since partici-
pated in .several National Conventions. In
1888 she was cho.sen by the Department Coun-
cil to fill a vacancy in the office of Department
Chaplain, was re-elected to the position by the
annual convention in 1889 and again in 1890.
On account of severe illness Mrs. Clark retired
from active work the following year, but in
1892 accepted the office of Department Senior
Vice-President, and upon the expiration of its
term was nominated for the highest office in
the gift of the convention. Mrs. M. Susie
Goodale, Past Department President, pre-
sented her name as follows: —

" I have the honor to place in nomination
Mrs. Emily L. Clark, who has many qualifi-
cations for the position. First of all, she has
a heart filled with love for humanity, and very
few are the days when .some poor wounded soul
does not seek and find comfort beneath her
sheltering roof. In all this she is seconded
by her .soldier husband. Again, she is a pioneer
in the order, and has servetl you faithfully
as Department Chaplain and Senior Vice-
President. I believe her to be in every way
qualified for the position."

Mrs. Clark was unanimously elected, and
upon assuming the duties of her office gave
special attention to the interests of the corps
throughout the State. Though living one
hundred miles from Department headquarters
in Boston, she was on duty there several days
each week. A summary of her work was given
in her address to the convention of 1894, over
which she presided with grace and ability.
During the year she travelled more than twenty

thousantl miles, and visited seventy-two corps,
besides attending many camp-fires, receptions,
anniversaries, and fairs. Three corps were in-
stituted during lier administration, making
a total of one hundred and fifty-nine corps
under her charge. She aimed to encourage
all in the noble work in which they were engaged.
Mrs. Clark issued nine general orders and two
circular letters, huntlreds of copies of which
were mailed to ilifTerent sections of the coun-
try. Referrmg to her personal work, she said:
" I have written more than twelve hundred
letters, answered innumerable questions, and
endeavored to instruct and encourage all who
asked for advice. The many personal letters
I have received, expressing appreciation for
help given, will be to me a storehouse of pleas-
ure in the coming years, when I shall have
leisure to again read these words of commenda-
tion."

Mrs. Clark visited the Soldiers' Home in
Chelsea several times during her atlministra-
tion, and issuctl an appeal to corps in general
orders to furnish some of the new rooms in the
annex. She also expressetl an interest in hav-
ing the Department of Massachusetts creditably
represented in the National Woman's Relief
Corps exhibit at the Workl's Fair, and a lib-
eral contribution was sent by her order for this
object. In reporting the results of the year's
work, she referred to the thousands of callers
she had met at headquarters and to the mutual
benefits thereby received. Upon retiring from
the office of Department President, Mrs. Clark
was appointed Councillor on the staff of her
successor. She also aided Corps No. 18 of
Northampton by accepting an appointment
as secretary, and has continuetl her active in-
terest in the corps. Mrs. Clark served as Na-
tional Chaplain pro tern, at the National Con-
vention at Boston in 1890, at Indianapolis in-
1893, and was unanimously elected to this
office at the National Convention at Cleveland,
Ohio, September, 1901.

Her kindly interest in the welfare of others
and her cheerful manner have made her pop-
ular with all classes of people.

Her husband, Edwin C. Clark, was identified
with the business interests of Northampton.
In April, 1861, he assisted in recruiting Com-



pany A of the Twenty-seventh Massachusetts
Regiment, and was conmiissioned Second Lieu-
tenant. He served at Roanoke Islam!, New-
bern, ami in other campaigns under General
Burnside. Lieutenant Clark resigned his com-
mission and returned home in 1862, when he
re-enlisted in the Fifty-second Massachusetts
Regiment, receiving a commission as First
Lieutenant. He subsequently accepted a com-
mission as Quartermaster. This regiment
took part in General Banks's expedition, and
performed active duty at Baton Rouge, Barry's
Landing, and Port Hudson. Captain Clark,
who had received this title by brevet, remainetl
with his regiment until it was mustered out of
service in the fall of 1863.

He was highly esteemed by the citizens of
Northampton, and could have been the first
Mayor of the city, had he cared for the office.
He was treasurer and superintendent of the
Northampton Street Railway Company for
several years, and held other positions of trust.
His death occurred May 10, 1898.

Captain and Mrs. Clark had two sons and
two daughters. Itla B., the eklest child, born
July 18, 1852, married Joseph Carhart, presi-
dent of the State Normal School of North Da-
kota. They have three sons and seven daugh-
ters. Edwin Cook Clark, born January 3,
1856, is suijerintendent of the extensive elec-
tric railroatl of Northampton, and receives the
largest salary of any superintendent in Massa-
chusetts hokling a similar position. He mar-
ried Mona Fogel, of Northampton. They have
three children. Mary A. Clark, born October
28, 1860, married Emlyn V. Mitchell, of Hart-
ford, Conn. They have four children. Will-
iam A., born March 2, 1868, a prominent busi-
ness man of Northampton, in 1897 marrietl
Alice R., daughter of the Hon. George W.
Johnson, of Brookfield, Mass.



HULDA BARKER LOUD was born
September 13, 1844, in East Abing-
ton, now Rockland, Mass., being a
daughter of Reuben and Betsey
(Whiting) Loud. She attended the public
schools of that town, and was graduated from
the high school in 1862. Becoming a teacher

the same year, she continued, with the exception
of three years, to teach for twenty-two years,
most of the time in East Ahington. She was
principal of a grammar sciiool for hfteen years,
receiving most of the years the same salary
as that paid men holding a similar position.
This came as the result of her arguments with
the school committee regarding the question
of equal rights, the members of the conunittee
being convinced that she had justice on her
side. Miss Loud was elected a member of the
Rockland School Board in LS87, and .served
in that capacity until LS90.

From LS72 to LS7r) she was a speaker in the
woman suffrage cause, performing able .service
for this movement by her convincing argu-
ments and earnest manner. In 1S84 a new
paper was starteil in Rockland, and an invita-
tion extendetl to Mi.ss Loud to become its edi-
tor. She named the pajjcr The Independent.
Five years later she purchased the entire prop-
erty connected with the paper, including the
job printing as well as the publishing busine-ss.
The paper, which is devoted to social and
political reform, continues to be successfully
conducted by Mi.ss Loud, who is sole proprietor.
In her opening editorial in 1889, after the
paper came into her hands, she announced
that she had gone into the newspaper business
with the .sole purpo.se to help save the world,
and her ways of saving it would appear in fut-
ure editorials. The Independent is an eight-page
paper, and she has averaged a page of editorials
each week. As a ])ublisher she has shown
excellent business ability, and the articles from
her pen are in harmony with the name of her
paper. She is a womaii who has the courage
of her convictions, and fearlessly denounces
unjust measures. The Independent represents
the highest principles, and is supported by
people who have the interests of the public
at heart. The fact that she has continued in
its management for .so many years proves that
her efforts are appreciated.

Miss Loud represented the National Assembly
of the Knights of Labor at the Wonian's Inter-
national Congress, held in Washington, D.C.,
in March, 1888, aufl addressed the congress
upon the subject, " Women in the Knights of
Labor." Her addresses have been received



with enthusiasm, but home life is more con-
genial to her than public life, and she prefers
newspaper work to the lecture platform. In
1891 she adopted two grand-nephews, and
had a hou.se built for them near her old home.
The eldest, Ralph Powers, was fataly injured
by falling from his bicycle in 1898. His brother
Carl was graduated from the Rockland High
School in June, 1903.



ELEANOR BALDW^IN CASS was born
in Charlestown, Mass., less than thirty
years ago. She is the daughter of
Charles F. and Mary (Gilbert) Baldwin.
Her maternal grandfather, Robert Gilbert,
was an Irishman. One of her paternal an-
cestors, Jean Gieto, who was a Frenchman,
left Paris at the time of the commune (1789-
94) and came to America. He attained the
great age of one hundred and six. The family,
it may be said, is noted for longevity and ath-
letic ability.

Eleanor Baldwin was graduated from the
grammar and high schools of Charlestown,
later taking the regular counse at Dr. Sargent's
Normal School and a special course of instruc-
tion at Emerson College, Boston. She stud-
ied French and German with private tutors
and took voice training under .some of the lead-
ing teachers of New England.

She was married to John William Ca.ss in
1900, and is the mother of one child.

With her hu.sband's encouragement Mrs.
Cass has continued her work of teaching and
lecturing, which she enthusiastically enjoys.
She instructs at the Durant Gymnasium, and
also has many private pupils in physical cult-
ure and fencing, of which art she is perfect
mistress.

Her lectures deal mostly with the "balance
of mind and body." Though she has been
often lieard at the Somerset, the Tuileries, and
Vendome in Boston, she is far better known
in New York and Newport. Her first lectures
were given at Newport. These led to the for-
mation in Newport, by Mrs. Cass, in 1897, of
a fencing club, which was the first club of its
kind for women in the country. Mrs. Cass
has lectured before some of the most fashion-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



473



able and representative women in the country.
Though still a young woman, she has won
phenomenal success in her chosen work. She
goes in society a great ileal, and is a great favor-
ite in Newport, being a very clever entertainer.
She is an expert horsewoman, plays a fine game
of tennis, and makes a good partner at golf.
She has but little time for social and club life,
but is intelligently alive to all movements which
tend to elevate American womanhood. She
is an earnest advocate of simple and hygienic
living.



A GNES BEARCE DAY, whose maiden
/ \ name was Agnes Bearce, was born in
JTjL Calais, Me., September 21, 1867. Her
parents were Byron A. Bearce and
Ella F. McDougall Bearce, the latter belong-
ing to one of the best known Scottish families
of the Province of New Brunswick, anil directly
descended from the famous clan McDougall of
Scotland. Agnes Bearce in her girlhood at-
tended the public schools of Lewiston, and was
graduated from tlie high school in 1883. She
was married in Boston, September 12, 1903, to
Holman F. Day, of Auburn, Me.

Mrs. Day's artistic impulses came to her
early in life. She was first drawn to china
decorating, and displayed so nuich talent that
after a course of study with local teachers she
went to New York and pursued her calling in
some of the best keramic stutlios. While there
her work shown at the Waldorf-Astoria ex-
hibit attracted much favorable notice. She
has also studied with well-known Boston
artists, and is recognized in the leading art
circles of that city.

She began teaching in Lewiston in 1896,
and has had classes most of the time since then.
She has given annual e.xhibits of her produc-
tions. The work she has done in water-colors
antl oils during the past few years has re-
ceived fitting and extremely favorable notice
in high quarters. Her keramic achievements
have been especially gratifying to her friends.
Two years ago the managers of Poland
Spring Hotel solicited and placed a case of
her work on exhibition for the summer in
their widely known art gallery, to which only



artists of recognized talent are admitted.
Her designs have been [printed in some of the
leading art publications of the country.

P'or five years she has held the position of
superintendent of the Maine State Art Ex-
hibit, and for the past four years (1899-1902)
has had entire charge of their annual exhibit
at Lewiston. Her duties comprise the col-
lection of the jVictures and china and all the
tletails of arrangement, and it is pleasing to
note that the art exhibit has grown steadily
under her management.

She is a member of the Murray Club of
Lewiston, and has been a member of the New
York Society of Keramic Arts since 1899.
In her religious faith she is a Universalist.
Her home is on Court Street, Auburn, Me.



ANNIE C. SHATTUCK, of Fitchburg,
/\ Mass., a National .\ide in the Woman's
X. ^ Relief Corps and a devoted worker for
the cause of patriotism, was born No-
vember 26, 1851, at New Ipswich, N.H., her
j)arents being \\'illiain K. and Elizabeth (Stark)
Hassall. On the paternal side she comes of a
long line of worthy New England ancestors,
one of whom, Anna Hassall, was massacred by
the Indians, September 2, 1691. On her
mother's side she is a descendant of Arcliii)ald
Stark, born in Glasgow, Scotland, in ]&amp;)7,
who married Eleanor Nichols iji Londonderry,
Ireland, and came to New England in 1720
with the party of Scotch-Irish that settled
Londontierry, N.H. From this pair Mrs. Shat-
tuck claims descent through Major-general John
Stark (as a great-great-grand-daughter) tlie
noted Revolutionary hero, who at Bennington
and on other battle-fields achieved so much
for the cause of American independence.

Annie C. Hassall was edvicated in the public
schools and at the then noted Appleton Acad-
emy in her native town. In 1861, on the break-
ing out of the Civil War, when societies were
being formed for the relief of the soldiers at the
front and in the hospitals, her mother, who was
an active member of some of these .societies,
wishing her to aid in the good work, taught
her how to knit. Although then but a girl of
ten, she knit several pairs of hose, which, with



474



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



comfort bags that she helped to make and fill
and other supplies, were sent to the brave
"boys in blue." Among her most treasured
keepsakes now are some letters that she re-
ceived from one of these soldiers, who was
wounded and very ill in the hospital, and who
on receiving one of these comfort bags wrote
to express his gratitude and appreciation of
the work done by those at home for the sol-
diers.

In 1871 Miss Hassall became the wife of
Frederick D. Shattuck, who had enlisted in the
Union army soon after the attack on Fort
Sumter, and served subsequently until the close
of the war. He is now a member of E. V. Sum-
ner Post, No. 19, G. A. R., of Fitchburg.

Mr. and Mrs. Shattuck are the parents of
three children, two daughters and a son. The
son, Frederick A. Shattuck, was for two years
and a half a teacher in the service of the United
States government in the Philippines, where he
instructed the children in the principles of
liberty and representative government, and
taught them to love the flag of the country
whence they had received these blessings.
From the islands he forwarded to his home in
Fitchburg some valuable and interesting souve-
nirs, accompanietl by letters containing 9. record
of his experiences, with interesting descriptions
of the country and its people, showing him to
be a young man of observation and keen in-
sight as well as literary ability. He is now
teaching in Tokio, Japan, where he is associated
with the Rev. Dr. Gate, a Universalist mis-
sionary.

In 1885 Mrs. Shattuck was initiated a mem-
ber of E. V. Sumner Corps, No. 1, W. R. C,
of Fitchburg. After serving in several offices
she was elected President two successive years,
and has held the oflice of Secretary for eight
years. Since uniting with the order she has
attended as a delegate (with one exception)
every department convention, and has -served
continuously on important committees in the
corps and the department. She has efficiently
performed the work of an Assistant Inspector
and Installing Officer, besides attending to
numerous other duties. She has also taken
part in many patriotic gatherings in different
parts of the State. She was elected three years



in succession a member of the Department
Executive Board at the State conventions, and
is regarded in many quarters as a future leader
of the Department of Ma.ssachusetts.

Mrs. Shattuck has attended several national
conventions, and is a National Aide the present
year (1904). She is one of the vice-presidents
of the General Conunittee, and also a member
of the ICxecutive Committee of Arrangements
for the national convention in Boston. The
corps of which she is a member is the oldest in
the country, the first convention of the order
having been held in Fitchburg. There are now
three thousand corps in the various States and
Territories of the Union. Mrs. Shattuck was
the first President of the Worcester County As-
sociation of the Woman's Relief Corps, and is
highly esteemed in the different posts and corps
in the county. During the war of 1898 with
Spain she was a member of the citizens' com-
mittee, which was composed of the leading
citizens of Fitchburg, who held their "meetings
in the State armory and formulated plans for
the relief of the soldiers of that war. She also
attended the meetings of the ladies who met
to carry out those plans, in which she took a
very active part.

Mrs. Shattuck was one of the Vice-Regents
of the Fitchburg Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution, a Past Matron of Lady
Emma Chapter of the Order of the Eastern
Star, and a member of the Woman's Club, of
Fitchburg. She is actively identified with the
work of the LTniversalist church, of which she
is a member, and vice-president of the ladies'
circle of the church in Fitchburg.

Mrs. Shattuck is a pleasing speaker, and had
the honor of delivering the Memorial Day ad-
flress at her native town this year (1904) by
invitation of the Grand Army Post of New
Ipswich, N.H. The Fitchhuni (Mass.) Sentinel,
in referring to her address on this occasion, said:
" Her reference to the purpose of the Grand
Army, to the origin of the Relief Corps antl of
Memorial Day as a nation's holiday, and her
adtlress to each organization represented, were
all heard with the keenest interest, and would
be heard again with pleasure. She seemed in-
spired by her subject, and with her clear, dis-
tinct utterance, her voice without apparent

effort was easily heard in every part of the
hall."

Mrs. Shattuck is a woman of strong indi-
viduality and kindness of heart, generous and
hospitable, a lover of liberty, of home. State,
and country. She believes in striving each day
to leave a record of some gootl accomplished,
"some worthy action done," and in exemplify-
ing the true principles of a Christian life.



MARY ETHERIDGE THOMPSON
CHAPIN (Mrs. Henry W. Chapin)
was born in Yarmouth, Me., the
daughter of Moses Wirt and Huldah
Green (True) Thompson. A girl of great
versatility, of talent and wide range of affin-
ities with artistic and intellectual life, her
first inclination revealed itself in sculpture,
and even so great an authority as Anne Whit-
ney recognized her genuine talent for the
plastic art. From her father Miss Thompson
inherited her ardent love of art, which was
destined later on to play an important part
in her work for humanity. After graduating
with academic honors, Miss Thompson took
the complete kindergarten training course
under the famous Miss Garland, and in Cam-
bridge she lectured on teaching, taking the
head of the kindergarten established by Eliza-
beth Peabody and Mrs. Horace Mann. With
these two ladies she lived, and to have thus
come under the remarkable influence of Miss
Peabody she has always accounted as a sig-
nificant event in her life.

In her early youth she became the wife of
Henry AV. Chapin, of Boston, who is an official
in the government service, and from this time
Mrs. Chapin 's life began that marked expansion
which has made her a potent and beneficent
factor in educational antl artistic life. In
special courses of study in Radcliffe College,
in travel, and in constant contact with the
world of thought and purpose, she has achieved
a power that she brings to bear upon munic-
ipal life in many tiirections. In 1897 Mrs.
Chapin conceived the idea of courses of free
art lectures for the people, to be given in the
Boston Public Library: and, securing the
sympathy and consent of the trustees, this



movement was inaugurated, and has success-
fully continued, Mrs. Chapin assuming all the
financial responsibility. The beautiful idea of
adorning school-rooms with works of art was
original with Mrs. Chapin, and it so conuneniled
itself as to be widely adopted in Boston and
elsewhere.

A member of the famous Copley Club, Mrs.
Chapin was the chairman of the committee
selected to choose pictures for free art ex-
hibitions for the people, which were given in
the South P]n(l House (so admirably managed
by Mr. Robert Wood) anil in several school-
houses. Mrs. Chapin is a prominent member
of the New England Woman's Club. She
was one of the founders of the Metaphysical
Club, and also of the Unity Art Club, of which
she has always been the president ; and
she has always been the recipient of social
and scholarly honors, among the latter of which
is tlie unicjue distinction of having the star,
Etheridgea, discovered by Professor Charlois,
of Nice, in April, 1892, named for her.

Through her ancestry Mrs. Chapin is eligible
to the Society of Daughters of the Revolution
and that of the Colonial Dames; and, though her
busy life does not permit of her active member-
ship, she is often a speaker at their banquets.
Mrs. Chapin's mental ecjuipment for a public
speaker is enhanced by beauty, charm and dis-
tinction of presence, and a voice of combined
strength and flexibility.

As a lecturer she has made herself a special
favorite, and her Thursday morning " con-
ferences," given in her home, on the general
theme of the art of higher and nobler living,
draw select and enthusiastic hearers. Mrs.
Chapin is still a young woman, and her ardent
buoyancy of temperament, her fine poise, and
exalted mental attitude combine to render
her work and influence among the beneficent
forces of the day.



HELEN Mackenzie graves, a
successful business woman of Boston,
is a native of Nova Scotia, her birth-
place and the home of her parents,
David and Christina (Sutherland) MacKenzie,
being in Pictou County. Her grandparents on



476



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



her mother's side were Angus and Isabella C.
(Gordon) Sutherland; on her father's side,
John and Catherine (Mcintosh) MacKenzie,
all Scottish Highlanders, belonging to old and
distinguished clans. They migrated to Nova
Scotia in the early part of the nineteenth cen-
tury. The History of Pictou County states
that Donald Mcintosh and Angus Sutherland
took up their residence in the unbroken forest
in the year 1813.

Angus Sutherland, the maternal grand-
father above mentionetl, was one of the Suth-
erlands of Sutherlandshire (in the extreme
north of Scotland, south of Caithness), the
head of which family for many generations
bore the title of Earl, the line at length ending
in an heiress, "Elizabeth Sutherland, Countess
of Sutherland in her own right and proprie-
tress of the greater part of Sutherlandshire,"
who married in 1785 George Granville Leveson
Gower, the latter becoming in 1833 the first
Duke of Sutherland.

The maternal grandmother, Isabella C,
wife of Angus Sutherland, was the daughter
of Robert and Christina (Arnot) Gordon. Her
father is said to have sprung from the same
stock as the distinguished British general,
Charles George Gordon, known as "Chinese
Gordon" — born at Woolwich, England, in 1833,
son of William H. and Elizabeth (Enderby)
Gordon and grandson of William A. and Anna
M. (Clarke) Gordon-^whose great-grandfather,
David Gordon, emigrated from Scotland after
the battle of Culloden, and died in Halifax,
N.S., in 1752.

Robert Gordon is believed to have been very
nearly related to David Gordon. Alexander
Gordon, son of Robert, was a paymaster in
the Forty-second Highlanders (the "Black
Watch"), and his brother Donald was band-
master of the same regiment.

Helen MacKenzie (now Mrs. Graves) at the
age of sixteen, having received a public school
education in her native place, came to Boston,
Mass., to enter upon the active duties of life
on her own account.

After various discouraging experiences in
attempting to find a position for which she
was fitted, she secured employment in the
office of a laundry machinery company, be-



ginning there at the lowest round of the ladder.
She felt that this was the opportunity for
which she had been looking, and determined
to make the most of it by doing her work well.
Her energy and faithfulness soon attracted
the attention of the officers of the company,
and they tlecided to make the experiment
of placing her in charge of a department of
the business that had previously been con-
ducted entirely by men engaged as travelling
agents.

The mere mention of employing a woman in
that capacity was regarded as preposterous.
Nevertheless, she began to travel for the com-
pany, and immediately proved herself capable
of doing the work assigned her in a satisfactory
manner. She installed steam laundry plants
all over the United States, instructing opera-
tives in the running of the machines, and
gained a reputation as an authority in this
branch of the business. It was hard, exact-
ing, fatiguing work, and after a time, wishing
to settle in a permanent location, she accepted
a position as suj)erintendent and manager
of one of the largest steam laundries in the
East. This position she held eighteen years,
resigning it two or three years ago to embark in
her present enterprise, establishing and carry-
ing on a steam laundry in the Allston district
of Boston. The "Mayflower Laundry," as it
is called, has been conducted with her usual
energy, industry, and honesty, and with such
signal ability that it is a pronounced success,
ranking as a first-class establishment of its
kind and a credit to its proprietor and man-
ager.

January 16, 1891, Helen MacKenzie was
married to Oliver B. Graves, of the firm of
Graves &amp; Henry, of Harvard Square, Cam-
bridge, Mass.



AMY MORRIS BRADLEY, educator,
/\ was born September 12, 1823, in East
X ^ Vassalboro, Me. When she was six
years old, her mother died, leaving a
large family of children. Amy being the young-
est. In 1840 she became a public school
teacher, contimiing in the profession ten years.
During the first four years of this time she



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



477



studied at the academy at East Vassalboro in
the spring and fall, teaching only during the
sunuuer and winter months.

In 1844 she was principal of a grammar
school at Gardiner, Me., later on she was an
assistant in the Winthrop Granunar School,
Charlestown, Mass., and afterward in the
Putnam Grammar School, East Cambridge.
Obliged on account of bronchial trouble to
relinquish her duties, she spent a winter at
the home of her brother in Charleston, S.C,
and during the two years following she was an
invalid at her old home in Maine. She needed
a milder climate, anil, embracing an opportunity
that came to her unexpectedly, she sailed for
Costa Rica in November, 1853. Some months
after, in San Jose, where among the mountains
her health improvetl, Miss Bradley established
the first English school in Centi-al America.
This school she conducted successfully for three
years.

Owing to the serious illness of her father,
who was eighty-three years old, she returned
to her home in Maine in June, 1857. Mr.
Bradley died in June, 1S5S.

Early in 1861 she was in the employ of the
New England Glass Company at East Cam-
bridge as translator of the Spanish language.

Miss Bradley was thoroughly j^atriotic, and
after the first battle of Bull Run she offered
her services to the government as an army
nurse. She began her labors in September in
a hospital near Alexandria, Va., antl was soon
appointed matron of the Seventeenth Brigatle
Hospital. In the spring of 1862 she responded
to a call from the Relief Department of the
United States Sanitary ConnnLssion, and went
with Miss Dix to Fortress Monroe. She was
assigned to service on the transport boats, and
labored faithfully throughout the Peninsular
Campaign.

Later in the year she became special relief
agent of the Sanitary Conmiission at the camp
near Alexandria, Va. Regarding her work
here she wrote in her diary: "I entered upon
my duties as .soon as the camp was moved to
its present location, on the ITtli of December,
1862. The soldiers were in tents. No bar-
racks had been erected. Many I found sick
and stretchetl on the almost frozen ground in



midwinter, with only a suit of ragged and fever-
soiled clothes and one army blanket, with no
nourishment that they could take, or that was
suitable for sick men. . . .

" Making out requisition in form, I drew
a quantity of woollen shirts, and on Sunday
morning at inspection I went with the officer,
and foimd in the line of men on that damp and
chilling day, on the banks of the Potomac
in midwinter, seventy-five with only thin cot-
ton shirts. To these I gave warm flannels at
once, and ever since the really needy have been
supplied. Then I went through the sick tents,
and immediately after sought an interview
with the commantling officer, told him my
plan, and asked for hospital tents. These were
at once pitched and flooretl. Stoves were
placed in them, and the sick collected and made
as comfortable as possible. A squad of men
was detailed to assist me, and every facility
placed in my power."

In recognition of the value of her services
at Camp Convalescent, the ability, faithful-
ness, and entire self-devotion with which she
performed the work intrusted to her charge.
Miss Bratlley was presentetl with a handsome
watch and chain, "a gift from soldiers to the
soldier's friend."

Miss Bradley received many testimonials of
regard, among them the following from Mr.
John S. Blatchford, secretary of the Sanitary
Commission: "Your impaired health, incurred
in the performance of your self-imposeil and
most arduous labors for the welfare of our sol-
diers, is observed by your friends with solici-
tude and regret. The service which you have
rendered to the cause of humanity, antl the
influence you have exerted, resulting in untold
alleviation and comfort to those to whom you
have ministered in many ways beyond the ordi-
dary experience of women, are such as to secure
to you the lasting regartl and love of all who
have known you in your work. That work
has been characterized by rare judgment,
great efficiency, untiring zeal and devotion.
It is above praise."

In 1866, under the auspices of the American
Unitarian Association, Miss Bradley went to
Wilmington, N.C., to teach jioor white children.
The following is from an account of her work



478



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



published shortly after her death, which oc-
curred in January, 1904: —

She opened her school on January 9, 1867,
in a very small building, and within a week had
sixty-seven pupils. The condition of some of
these was deplorable. Miss Bradley hafl liter-
ally to feet! the hungry and clothe the poor
before she could minister to their spiritual and
mental necessities, meanwhile establishing a
Sunday .service in which .she was teacher, super-
intendent, antl preacher. The school rapidly
increased under her fostering care, and was
soon placed upon a firm basis. Through the
generosity of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, who had
been interested in the undertaking from the
first, the field of usefulness was greatly enlarged.
The corner-stone of a new building was laid in
1871, and in 1872 the large, well-equipped Tiles-
ton School was opened to the public, the first
free public school in Wilmington. Trained
teachers were brought from the North, and so
numerous were the applications for admittance
to the school that many had to be turned away;
but it was never the poor who were rejected. . . .
In five years the school had grown from a small
roomful of timid, half-suspicious, hungering
souls into a large, crowded school of ten or
twelve rooms, with all the modern etlucational
appliances, for which Mrs. Hemenway had
assumed the financial responsibility.

"Miss Bradley, in spite of delicate health,
continued her work until the summer of 1891.
Three generations have arisen to call her blessed.
She was the friend, adviser, and helper of all,
in matters physical as well as spiritual. That
she was endowed with the sterling qualities
we are wont to claim for our New England
ancestors goes without .saying. . . . She was an
ardent Unitarian, and welcomed warmly the
transient few who strayed into the city. With
quaint humor she would say, 'Ah, now you
have doubled the number of Unitarians in
Wilmington.' Miss Bradley died in the little
brown cottage in the school grounds, which
had so long been her home. The announce-
ment of her death was received in Wilmington
with reverent sorrow. . . .

" The body lay in state all day Sunday, Jan-
uary 17. The editor of the Dispatch, of Wil-
mington, thus spoke of her: 'She was one of



Wilmington's foremost citizens, and the magni-
tude of her work stands out to-day as an ever-
lasting monument. Miss Bradley was the
mother of public school education in Wilming-
ton. . . . Year by year her influence grew, and
the aim of her life grailually rounded into
success. The seed she planted over a quarter
of a century ago grew and developed into one
of the finest public school systems in the coun-
try. Her name will ever be held in highest
reverence in this community.'"



PAULINE SAWTELLE JONES, portrait
artist, the wife of Charles Willis Jones,
lawyer, of Augusta, Me., was born in
Old Town, Penob.scot County, that State.
Daughter of James Harvey Sawtelle and his
wife, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Knowl-
ton Chapman, she is descended on the paternal
side from Richard Sawtelle of Groton, Mass.
Her great, ' great grandparents, Jonas and
Eunice (Kempt) Sawtelle, .served through the
Revolutionary War, he as a private, she as a
nurse. Her maternal grandfather was Nathaniel
Chapman, who served in the Revolutionary
army from 1775 to 1780. He was at the
Battle of Bunker Hill, antl was also with Wash-
ington's life-guard at the crossing of the Dela-
ware antl the surprise and defeat of the He.s-
sians at Trenton. He married Sally Gott, of
Starks, Me.

The subject of this sketch very early showed
a decided taste for drawing faces. The white
wails of the attic, the covers of her school-
books, or any surface that would take a mark,
was covered by the chiklish fingers with draw-
ings in lead-pencil, chalk, or charcoal, which-
ever lay nearest to hand. The old proverb,
"Necessity is the mother of invention," proved
true in her case when, at the age of eight, she
cruslied the old-fashioned flowers growing in
the garden, that she might thus be enabled to
give a semblance of natural coloring to the
faces she delighted in. At the age of eighteen
it became possible for her to begin the study of
art in earnest. Going to Boston, she became
a pupil of Mr: George A. Frost (who afterward
accompanied Kennan to Siberia to illustrate
the latter's articles on that country), and sub-

sequently she studied with the late Harry De
Merritt Young. She also received art training
in Philadelphia and New York. She then
opened a studio in Conconl, N.H., where she
painted many distinguished people. Her work
soon began to attract notice, winning favorable
comment from art critics, brother artists, and
the general public, whenever exhibited. Since
then she has advanced from high to higher
planes of achievement, until now she may be saiil
to have attained the full maturity of her powers.
She prefers to work wholly from life, but her
portraits from photographs show the same force
of imagination, complete technical mastery of
form and color, and deep and sympathetic un-
derstanding of her subject. She is absorbed in
the personality of the face she is painting, think-
ing of it, dreaming over it, and never satisfied
until she has transmitted not only the features
but the very spirit of her subject to the canvas.
She has receivetl several gold medals for the
excellence of her work, and numbers among
her patrons" some of the most critical people of
Boston and New York.

She has exhibited in New York and Spring-
field, at the Boston Art Club, the Portland Art
Club, Polantl Springs Art Club. One of her best
crayons is the free-hand portrait of Maine's
distinguished Senator, the Hon. James W. Brad-
bury, which elicited much favorable conmient
at the World's Fair in 1893. Two of her minia-
ture portraits were accepted by the Boston
Art Club for its sixty-second exhibition. One
of these was of her son Frederick, the other
of Mrs. Llewellyn Powers, wife of Governor
Powers.

Among her pastels two — one of Dwight
Carver, son of State Librarian Carver, and the
other of Robert Livingstone, the little son of
Rev. William F Livingstone and his wife,
Margaret Vere Farrington — stand out promi-
nently as representative of her very best work.
Another fine piece of work, accurate and strong
in character, is her crayon portrait of former
President Geiders of the Maine Senate, which
hung for a time in the capitol, but which has
since been presented to Mr. Geiders by the
Senate. In 1900 Mrs. Jones painted in oil the
portrait of Governor Powers, which now hangs
in the rotunda of the State capitol, and which



has been described as a characteristic and speak-
ing likeness.

It is, however, for her exquisite miniature
work that Mrs. Jones has won the greatest
praise; and it has been said that, if placed
side by side with the work of the few really
great artists in this line, they would not
suffer by comparison. Gifted primarily with
artistic talent, she possesses also in a high de-
gree the power of concentration and a marvel-
lous industry that, united, have compelletl suc-
cess. Mrs. Jones is a club woman, being a
member of the Koussinoc Chapter D. A. R., of
the Augusta China Decorator Club, the Cecilia
Club, and the Current Events Club.

The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Jones occurred
in Bangor, March 11, 1891. They have one
chikl, Frederick Sawtelle Jones, who was born
July 6, 1892.



A BBY WILLIAMS MAY, the subject of
/ \ this sketch, was born in Boston on April
L \ 21, 1829, and named for her grand-
mother, Abigail Williams May, wife
of Samuel May. Her parents were Deacon
Samuel J. and Mary (Goddard) May. Her
father, who was commonly spoken of as
"Deacon May," was of the sixth generation of
his family in Massachusetts. The Rev. Sanuiel
Joseph May, a noted Unitarian preacher of
the last century, was his near relative. Deacon
May and his wife were at one time parishioners
of the Rev. John Pierpont and later of Theodore
Parker, and were devoted advocates of the
abolition cause. Mrs. May was prominent
among the ladies who hekl tables at the anti-
slavery fairs, which were for many years a
feature in the social life of Boston. I re-
member Abby very well at Parker's meeting.
From him I learned something of a European
trip which she made in her youth. Her father
subsequently told me of her devotion to a
motherless niece, whom she reared from infancy.

Miss May had many friendships, but she had
also great capacities for public service. She
was singularly free from any desire for personal
prominence, but her ability of mind and sound-
ness of character were recognized in all that
she undertook. When the exigencies of the



480



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



Civil War led to the organization of the Sani-
tary Commission, Miss May became a leader
in the group of patriotic women who in Boston
and Massachusetts generally exerted tiieniselves
to send aid and comfort to our soldiers in the
field. In a notice of Miss May published soon
after her death Mrs. E. D. Cheney says; —

"She was engaged in many philanthropic
movements, and usually went to the head by
a natural tendency. President of the Horti-
cultural School for Women, vice-president of
the New England Women's Club, presitlent of
the Massachusetts School Suffrage Association,
vice-president of the Association for the Ad-
vancement of Women, and director in other
institutions, she would seem to have found
ample scope even for her large powers."

Miss May was an ardent suffragist. She
was also much interested in dress reform, and
was active in the movement which led to the
improved system of imderwear for w-omen now
so generally adopted in this country. Her own
taste in dress was simple and individual. She
would wear a hat that shaded her eyes, shoes
adapted to the shape of her foot, and garments
of rich material, but of sombre color and com-
fortable cut. Mrs. Cheney says further: —

" In her later years education became her
greatest interest. She was one of the first
women elected on the school committee of
the city of Boston, and she served on it faith-
fully for several years. When through changes
in the manner of election she was not returned
to the board,' the ileep disappointment of her
fellow-citizens led them to petition for the
right of women to vote for the school com-
mittee. She was soon after appointed a member
of the Board, of Education. Her services in
this position were greatly valued, especially
her oversight of the normal schools, in which
both teachers and pui)ils profited by her wise
counsel and warm sympathy."

My own happiest iem(&gt;mbrance of Miss May
relates to her i)articii)ation, continued for
years, in tlie work of the Association for the
Advancement of Women. This Association,
which is now in some degree replaced by the
(General Federation of Women's Clubs, was
accustomed to hold an annual Congress of
Women in widely distant parts of the country.



At these meetings, which were continued during
a cjuarter of a century, the duties and interests
of women were considered in their most vital
relation to the well-being of society. They
were often held in cities where no one of the
participants was known by sight. On such
occasions Miss May would come upon the
scene attired in her usual plain, rather color-
less dress, wearing the broad-soled shoes and
serviceable hat, from the use of which she
never departed. This simple costimie hardly
commended her to an orilinary assemblage of
women. The hat, however, was soon removed,
its absence permitting a full view of the face,
with its cameo-like profile and fine expression.
As soon, moreover, as she began to take part
in the proceedings, the charm of her voice and
the power of her presence made themselves
felt. All did love to hear her and to look
upon her.

In the business of the meetings, which was
manifold and sometimes not without diffi-
culties, her advice and influence were most
important, and the "lady in plain clothes"
showed herself as she was, a great gentlewoman.
As such and as a most loyal and sympathetic
friend, faithful and affectionate in all personal
relations, she is remembered and mourned
by those who had the happiness of being her
fellow-workers.

Miss May's death occurred in Boston on the
30th of November, 1888, before the completion
of her fifty-ninth year.

MARGARET JANE BUTLER, whose
name has come into prominence in
connection with charity and reform
work in Boston, was born in Sebago,
Me., a daughter of John Emery and Mary Ann
(Farr) McDonald, and is of Scotch descent.
After taking up her i-esidence in Boston in her
early womanhood, Mrs. Butler became inter-
ested in the woman suffrage movement, and
soon joined the ranks. She is a fluent speaker,
and her voice has ever been raised in the cau.ses
of freedom and of philanthropy. She is closely
identified with the Woman's Relief Corps, the
Soldiers' Ladies' Aid Society, and was the in-



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



481



corporator of a charitable organization known
as the Ladies' Lyceum Union. Her work has
been wide and varied, and she has been an ac-
tive member of the following named organiza-
tions: Keystone Chapter, No. 18, Oriler of the
Eastern Star; Lnproved Order of Red Men,
Degree of Pocahontas; Women's Aiixiliarj'
Board to the Scots' Charitable Society; Charles
Russell Lowell Relief Corps, No. 28; Ladies'
Aid Association of the Soldiers' Home in Massa-
chusetts; Women's Charity Club; the Progres-
sive Fraternity; Mary Washington Lodge, No.
1, Daughters of Rebekah; Garret A. Hobart
Assembly, No. 383, R. S. G. F.

At her summer home in Maine numbers of
poor, over-worked people have been cheeretl
and helped by all the comforts that a good
hostess can furnish, and thus enabled at the
close of vacation to resume their work with
renewed courage and more faith in human
nature. For the past fourteen years she has
held annually a May Festival, in which from
two hundretl to three hundred and fifty children
have participated, the proceeds being expended
in charity. This festival has come to be one
of Boston's yearly attractions, looked forward
to by many as a charming entertainment with
a worthy cause for its object. For a long time
Mrs. Butler's efforts were ably seconded by
her husband, William S. Butler, one of the
successful merchants of Boston. Mr. Butler
died in 1898, and many a poor family felt
they had lost a friend.

Mrs. Butler is a Spiritualist, and is one of
the most successful clairvoyant physicians in
the country, but has not permitted herself to
become in any way bigoteil or narrow-mimled.
When her attention has been called to persons
needing a.ssistance, she has not considered
whether they were Protestant or Catholic, Jew
or Gentile, but has ever been ready to help.
In her own words, "I don't care whether peo-
ple are black or white, blameless or blame-
worthy. If they are cold, I must warm them ;
if they are hungry, I must feed them. They
are all God's children." This sentiment is
typical of her. Large of heart, sympathetic
in nature, frank, fearless, and outspoken, she
is emphatically a type of the "new woman"
that will be blessed by the coming generation.



MARIA MITCHELL, Ph.D., LL.D.—
Maria Mitchell, astronomer of world-
wide fame, discoverer of a comet in
1847, and for more than twenty
years a member of the faculty of Vassar College,
was a native of Nantucket. Born August 1,
1818, the third child of William and Lydia
(Coleman) Mitchell, she grew to womanhootl
in her island home, where she long remained
an iidiabitant, on every clear evening repairing
to the observatory on the roof of the house to
sweep the heavens with a telescope.

On the paternal side she was grand-daughter
of Peleg, Sr., and Lydia (Cartwright) Mitchell,
and on the maternal side grand-daughter of
Andrew Coleman, who was a great-grandson
of John antl Joanna (Folger) Coleman. This
remote ancestress, Joanna, was a daughter of
Peter Folger and sister to Abiah Folger, who
married Josiah Franklin and was the mother
of the illustrious Benjamin Franklin. Peter
Folger emigrated from Norwich, England, in
the seventeenth century, and in 1663 settled
in Nantucket, where he became a citizen of
prominence, being a teacher, surveyor, clerk
of the court and recorder, and "the scholar
of the conununity."

Of Richard' Mitchell, who came from the
Isle of Wight and was the progenitor of the
Nantucket family of this name, Maria was a
descendant in the sixth generation, the ances-
tral line being: Richard,' who married Mary
Wood; Richard,^ born in 1686, who married
Elizabeth Tripj); Richard,^ who married Mary
Starbuck; Peleg/ who married Lydia Cart-
wright; and William,^ the father above men-
tioned, who married Lydia Coleman.

\Mlliam Mitchell and his wife belongetl to
the Society of Friends. Mr. Mitchell was a
man of scholarly tastes and attainments, a
teacher by profession, afterward cashier of a
bank. He served as a member of the State
Senate, as one of Governor Briggs's Council,
and for a long time as one of the overseers of
Harvard College. His favorite science was
astronomy.

Maria Mitchell in her early years attended
schools — first public and then private schools —
taught successively by her father and the Rev.
Cyrus Peirce, an educator of high repute, best



482



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



known in later days as the first principal of
the first normal school in New England.

At the age of sixteen Miss Mitchell became
assistant in Mr. Peirce's school in Nantucket.
This was succeeded for a time by a private
school of her own; and after that she served
for nearly twenty years as librarian of the Nan-
tucket Athenaeum, doing much to direct the
taste in literature of the Nantucket youth of
the period. She herself, as stated by her
sister, Phebe Mitchell Kendall, compiler of her
"Life, Letters, and Journals," which is the
source of the information that follows, was an
inveterate reader.

The original investigations in astronomy,
pursued by her with ardor from girlhood up
to the time of her professorship, had for their
most notable result the discovery on October
1, 1847, of a telescopic comet. For this
discovery she received in 1849 from King
Frederic VH. of Denmark the gold medal which
had been offered by his father, Frederic VL,
in 1831. For nineteen years she acted as
computer for the American Nautical Almanac.
In 1865 she accepted the chair of astronomy
at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., becom-
ing also director of the oljservatory. From
this time on until her resignation at Vassar in
January, 1888, on account of failing health,
she was an important factor in the movement
for the higher education of women, a work into
which "she threw herself, heart and soul," for
its sake giving up " in a great measure her
scientific life." Her father, with whom after
her mother's death she had lived in Lynn,
spent four happy years with her at Vas.sar,
his death occuring in 1869. Although Professor
Mitchell's resignation was not accepted, she
declined the offer of a permanent home at
Vassar, and returned to Lynn, where she died
June 28, 1889.

She was a member of the American Acad-
emy of Arts and Sciences; the American Philo-
sophical Society of Philadelphia; the New
England Women's Club; the New York Soro-
sis; and the Association for the Advancement
of Women, of which she was the president in
1875 and 1876. Referring to the two annual
congresses of the Association held during her
official term, one of its founders says of Miss



Mitchell: "She is remembered with especial
affection by those who were with her on these
occasions. Her tact and ability as a presiding
officer were remarkable, and her judgment re-
garding the matter to be presented to the
public was very valuable. At the congress
held in Philadelphia in the centennial year it
was desired by some that the meeting should
be opened with prayer. Mi.ss Mitchell decided,
to the general content of the assembly, that
a few minutes should be devoted to the silent
prayer of the Friends."

She was three times the recipient of honorary
degrees, the third being the LL.D. conferred
by Columbia College in 1887.

She made two trips abroad, the second in
the summer of 1873, when she went to Russia,
visiting St. Petersburg and other cities and the
government observatory at Pultowa. While
a true lover of her own country as pre-eminently
the land of freedom and self-government, she
looked for and saw the good in other lands.
As she expressed it: "We travel to learn;
and I have never been in any country where
they did not do something better than we do
it, think some thoughts better than we think,
catch some inspiration from heights above our
own — as in the art of Italy, the learning of
England, the philosophy of Germany."

Her faith in the coming woman led her to
write, " When the American girl carries her
energy into the great questions of humanity,
into the practical problems of life, when she
takes home to her heart the interests of edu-
cation, of government, of religion, what may
not be hoped for our country! "

ELIZABETH HELENA SOULE, a
teacher of ilramatic art, was born in
Pownal, Me., being the daughter of
Daniel and Mary True (Merrill) Soule.
Her father is said to have been a lineal descend-
ant of George Soule, who came in the "May-
flower" in 1620, also a descendant of the Rev.
John Wheelwright, an English divine who
came to this country a few years later, and
who founded the town of Exeter, N.H.
The Soule luie of descent, partially verified,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



483



has been thus given: George' Snule, "May-
flower" pilgrim, 1620, married Mary Becket,
who came in the "Anne" in 1621. John^ Soule
married in 1678 Esther, daughter of Samuel
Nash and widow of Sanmel Sampson, who was
killed in King Philip's War. She was John
Soule's second wife. Moses^ Soule, born 1684,
died 1751. Barnabus,* born 1707, married 1737
Jane Bradbury, daughter of Jacob' Bradbury
(William^ Thomas') and wife, Elizabeth Stock-
man. (William^ Bradbury married Rebecca
Wheelwright, daughter of the Rev. John Wheel-
wright.) Moses^ Soule, born 1788, married
Nancy Hewes in 1760. John" Soule married
Lois Carter. Daniel' Soule marrieil Mary True
Merrill, they being the parents of Elizabeth
Helena' Soule.

According to a statement appearing as a
quotation in a brief genealogy, the Merrills
(from whom Miss Soule is tlescended through
her mother) are sprung from the Huguenot
family of De Merle, who escaped from France
to England after St. Bartholomew's day, 1572.

Mrs. Soule's maternal line is given on private
authority as follows: John and Nathaniel Mer-
rill came from Salisbury, County Wilts, Eng-
land, and settletl at Newbury, Mass., early in
1635, being among the first .settlers of that
town. Nathaniel married Susannah Wilterton.
He die&lt;l in March, 1654-5. His widow married
a second husband, named Jordan. AbeP Mer-
rill, born in 1644, married Priscilla Chase in
1671. James' Merrill, born January 27, 1689,
married about 1715 at Newbury, Ma.ss.,
Mary Adams, daughter of Sergeant Abraham
and Mary Pettingil Adams. She was born
January 16, 1692. They moved to Falmouth,
Me., about 1738, and he died in 1758. Hum-
phrey* Merrill, born January 18, 1718, marrictl
Betty Merrill, of North Yarmo\ith, Me., August
29, 1741. He died January 1, 1815. Nathan-
iel Merrill, son of Humphrey, married first in
1775 Elizabeth Davis, daughter of Timothy"
and Margaret Davis. His .second wife was
Judith Brackett-. Nathaniel" Merrill married
Hannah True. Mary True Merrill, daughter of
Nathaniel Merrill, married Daniel Soule, father
of Elizabeth Helena Soule.

Mi.ss Soule received her education at W^est-
brook Seminary, a noted Maine school, and



in Boston, where she attended the New Eng-
land Conservatory of Music, devoting herself
to the study of oratory. After her graduation
she studied with Professors Lewis B. Monroe,
Robert R. Raymond, Alexander Graham Bell,
James E. Murdock, James Steele Mar, and
others. She aimed to obtain the best method
from each one of these eminent instructors.
Meanwhile she served for a few years as prin-
cipal of the Franklin Evening School. That
position she resigned at length for one that
appealed to her more earnestly — namely, the
specialty for which she had fitted herself, the
teaching and demonstrating of elocution and
dramatic art.

She refused many flattering offers to enter
the theatrical profession, preferring to work
along iiidividual lines. She has been much
before the public, however, as a dramatic
reader, and for several seasons was at the head
of the Soule Dramatic Company, which gave
entertainments throughout the New England
States and Canada. She has given nmch time
and thought to the study of Shakespeare, and
has won success as an exponent of Shakespeare's
women.

She has several times presented the "Mer-
chant of Venice," essaying herself the part of
Portia, with her pupils impersonating the other
charact':»rs, the production receiving high en-
comiums from eminent critics.

Many of her pupils are filling important
positions upon the professional stage. Physi-
cal culture is always a part of her work as a
teacher, and those who have been instructed
by her are adepts in the harmony of movement
which makes the art that conceals art.

Miss Soule has also accomplished e.xcellent
work as an organizer and leader of Shakespear-
ian and other literary clubs.

She has recently entered the lecture field,
for which her previous work has especially
fitted her. The .subjects of her lectures are
"Mere Man and Mere W'oman," an entertain-
ing, humorous social study, "The Yellowstone
Park," "The Grand Canon and Salt Lake City
and the Mormons." Her eloquent descrip-
tions are brightened throughout by frecjuent
sallies of wit.

The present summer of 1904 she is spending



484



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



in travel abroad for the purpose of studying
the methods of the London and Paris schools
of dramatic art and of obtaining additional
material for lectures.

Miss Soule is a member of the First Uni-
versalist Church of Boston, and is an enthu-
siastic leader in the work of the Sunday-school.
She is a member of the Daughters of Maine
Club and an honorary member of the Boston
Proof-readers' Association.

MARY F. EASTMAN was born in
Lowell, Mass. She was the third
chikl of Gardner K. and Mary F.
Eastman. Two brothers had died
in childhood. A sister, Helen Eastman, who
was two years younger than herself, and who
was her lifelong companion, flied in 1902.

The Eastman and Flanders families, from
which Miss Eastman sprang, were both of
English origin. Their early representatives in
this country were among the sturdy pioneers
who settled at Salisbury, Mass., about 1640.
The earliest ancestor in America, on one side,
was Rodger Eastman; on the other, Stephen
Flanders.

As noted by the author of "Tlie History and
Genealogy of the Eastman Family in America,"
Mr. Guy S. Rix, of Concord, N.H., "Rodger
Eastman and the other first .'ettlers in Salis-
bury and adjoining towns were Puritans; and
undei- the tyranny of the Tudors and Stuarts
many left th(&gt;ir native country to enjoy civil
and religious liberty."

The inunediate ancestor of Rodger East-
man was John Eastman, of Romsey, County
Southampton, England, who.se will was proved
in 1602. A noteworthy fact in the other-
wise conservative will of three hundred years
ago is that his wife Anne is appointed by him
residuary legatee and executrix. Consider-
ing the very limited amount of education
available to women in those days, especially
in matters of business, the trust woulil seem
to mark her as a woman of superior education
as well as of practical ability.

While the descendants of Rodger Eastman
and his associates were becoming "townsmen,"
"commoners," "freemen," and legislators —



sturdy workers and men of affairs as well —
at intervals the lurid light of conflict illumined
thei? sky. By a wily foe their houses were
set in flames, women carried into captivity,
and families scattered.

When a son of Rodger Eastman dieil, in
administration of his estate " his brother was
appointed guardian of his only son and of his
mother Deborah, who was then in captivity
to the Indians." Yet a valorous spirit pos-
ses.sed them, and the settlement began to ex-
tend into Connecticut, along the sea-coast,
and, in the third generation, up the Merri-
mac valley.

Captain Ebenezer Eastman was the first
settler of Concord, N.H. He was a man of
resolute courage, and had six sturdy sons. As
he had also considerable property, he soon
became "the strong man of the town." It is
of interest to note that from this simple Salis-
bury stock came the intellectual acumen of
Daniel Webster and the spiritual vision of
John G. Whittier.

Daniel Webster was born at Salisbury, N.H.,
1782. He was the second son of a small farmer
and justice of the county court, Ebenezer
Webster. His mother was Abigail Eastman,
fifth in line of descent from Rodger Eastman,
original settler, ancestor of the subject of this
sketch.

Fifth in the line of descent from Stephen
Flanders, "original settler" at Salisbury, Mass.,
was James Manders, E.sq., of Warner, N.H.,
who was Mi.ss Eastman's great-grandfather.
He was a piominent citizen, and represented
his constituency in the House and Senate of
New • Hampshire for twenty-four consecutive
years. His loyalty to conviction appears in
the fact that at one period he refused to take
the oath of office to support the Constitution
unless he could add the words "except in so
far as it recognizes human slavery." This
tied the legislative body up in a debate which
lasted three days, at the end of which time he
was allowed to take his seat.

The same quality conspicuous in James
appears in his son Philip, the maternal grand-
father of Miss Eastman.

He was a farmer, and was the father of six-
teen children. He was held in the highest

esteem for his sterling qualities. Like most
worthy citizens of the perioil, he was a member
of the Orthodox Congregational church; but,
having read reports of the doctrines preached
in England by John Murray, he pondered over
the new faith, and finally went into his regular
church prayer-meeting and said, "Brethren,
I have seen a great light." ITe then stated the
new belief of the so-called " Universalists,"
that a loving God would, in his own good time,
bring back all sinners to himself; and he added,
" I have reflected upon it, and I think it may
be true." The shock to his fellow church mem-
bers, that so good a man should thus depart
from the faith of his fathers, was very great.
At his funeral, in the presence of the twelve
surviving children, the minister extolled his
.virtues, but said, "We don't know where Major
Flanders has gone." Miss Eastman's mother,
one of the younger of the twelve, remembers
the shock which fell upon them at such a decree.
On the next Sunday, however, in a funeral
discourse, the same minister said, referring to
the fact that Mr. Flanders was member-elect
of the New Hampshire Legislature, " Brother
Flanders will not represent us in the courts
of earth, but we know that he represents us
in the courts of heaven."

The simple trust which characterized the
father descended to all but one of his many
children, and the courage of conviction seems
to have done so likewise, so that succeeding
generations have rejoiced in any light which
broke for them from the clouds of error, and,
like him, they "were not disobedient to the
heavenly vision."

In reading the history of the persecutions
our Puritan ancestors inflicted on Quakers,
Baptists, and others who did not conform to
the strict rules of the standing order, one can-
not help hoping that one's own kindred were
superior to the delusions and exempt from the
antagonisms to other faiths than their own that
marked our Puritan ancestors. Miss East-
man finds in Hoyt's "Old Families of Salisbury
and Amesbury" something conhrmatory of
her hopes as to her own forbears in the report of
a famous witch case: —

Thomas Bradbury was one of the most promi-
nent citizens of Salisbury — town clerk, school-



master, Representative in General Court for
a number of years, as.sociate judge, etc.
Most of the ancient records of Salisbury and
many of the county were written by him. He
dietl in 1694. Two years earlier Mrs. Brad-
bury, his wife, was tried for witchcraft anil
ably and courageously defended by Major
Robert Pike. She was condemned, but not
executed. A petition was presented in favor
of Mrs. Bradbury with eighty-seven signers,
one of whom was an ancestor of John G. Whit-
tier, and ten of whom were Eastmans male
and female.

The father of Mary F. Eastman, Gardner
Kimball Eastman, was born in Boscawen,
now Webster, N.H. The "Genealogy of the
Eastman Family in America," by Guy S. Rix,
says he was called "Bonus." Her mother,
Mary Flanders, was born in Warner, N.H.,
the daughter of Philip Flanders, one of the
sixteen previously mentioned in this sketch.
She was an earnest student, and on one occa-
sion appealed to an older cousin and her brother
to clear the mysteries she found in studying
interest and "the rule of three." They replied
that they were ashamed of a girl that wanted
to study interest. She became a successful
teacher, and, if not the first, she was among
the first to be thought competent to teach
and control the tall youth of a winter school
in her native town. Her later teaching was
in Charlestown and Somerville, Mass.

Shortly after her marriage to Mr. Eastman
they came to the young city of Lowell, where
their four children were born, and where Mr.
Eastman passed a long business career. He
also represented his constituency in the Mas-
sachusetts Legislature in his younger years,
but later was too avowed an abolitionist to
represent any party of the time.

In speaking of her home life Miss Eastman
says: "In our homo, while we lived in the
practical and real, we lived also in the ideal.
We lived in a (luiet way, but in the most pro-
gressive ideas and leading movements of the
time. I think of nothing which marks the
advanced thought and outreach of our later
times which my mother's thought and desire
did not foreshadow, except the great work of
organization, especially that among women,



486



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



which characterizes our period. By all that
thought is "advanced," it tends to isolation:
and those who in the middle half of the last
century were avowedly of the anti-slavery
and religiously unorthodox type were in so
far accounted peculiar people.

"I well recall tiiat, when a little girl, the
wonder to nie was that, while our associates went
only to fine halls, where were music and gayety,
we children were taken up into strange halls
in second stories, where few and mostly elderly
people were gatheretl, to listen to sad tales of
oppressed peoples far away, where once I re-
call the speaker, William Lloyd Garrison,
who stootl on steps from which he tokl us that
men, women, and children had been sold like
cattle. In later years I looked back upon
these meetings and knew that the 'upper
chambers' in which master spirits are called
to meet their disciples were not all in the far-
back centuries, and that I had been privileged
to look into a face illumined by the Christ
spirit."

In the prevalence of organization to-day,
notably that of women, all this is correcting
itself and working for the advancement of
humanity to a degree far beyond our ken.

" My parents were Universal ists, but were
not church members. As president of the one
sociological movement of the church at the
time, the ladies' sewing society, my mother
was asked why she and my father did not join
the church. Her reply was, "Do I not work
as cordially with you as if I did?" Being far-
ther pressed, she said, "To-day I am with you
in your fundamental beliefs, but I don't know
where I shall be to-morrow. There is much
yet to learn, and I am mentally and spirit-
ually on the inarch, and, if I join you, you will
want to hold me back; so I must be free of any
bonds, that I may follow my leading without
hindrance." Later on, however, she with
a very few women friends formed an organi-
zation for discussion or formal debate of the
leading questions of the day. So far as I can
ascertain, • this was the first organization of
the sort in the city of Lowell.

My sister and I were the younger members.
My sister was of an artistic temperament anrl
a deep spiritual nature. While self-distrustful



to shyness, a strong dramatic instinct had
its way, and drew her first upon the platform
as a reader, by preference of Shakespeare,
where she was received with distinguished
favor. She one day surprised the family by
saying, " I shall never do justice to the author,
the art, or even to myself, until I can lose my-
self in a single character." This finally led
to some months' study under W. H. Sedley
Smith, of the Boston Museum, and her debut
under Manager Ellsler, in Cleveland, OJiio,
in the part of Juliet, and an offer of a week's
engagement in the parts of Parthenia, Bianca,
Evadne, and Juliet, which followed her debut
in Boston. William \\'arren, who observed her
critically from the floor, said to her friends:
" Anything I can do for that young lady I
am ready to do. She will succeed." And
she did. But, alas, her delicate constitution
seemed to be threatened by the strain insep-
arable from her strenuous art; and, to allay the
anxiety of her mother, she surrendered this
art, to which every instinct of her nature called
her, as she would have buried a lost love. She
died in 1902. In connection with this beauti-
ful life Miss Eastman says: —

" I count it first of all chiefest of felicities

To have a spirit poised, and calm, and whole,
And next in order of felicities

I hold it to have walked with such a soul."

Miss Eastman's education in earlier girl-
hood was received mainly in the public schools
of Lowell, whose limitations were supplemented
at the same time by instruction in j:)rivate classes
in drawing, painting, horseback riding, dancing,
and later in the Lewis gymnastics. The public
course ended with the excellent high school.

So far as careful investigation by Miss East-
man could go some years since, she concluded
that to Lowell belongs the honor of being the
first city in the whole country to open a high
school for girls as well as boys. General
Benjamin F. Butler was of the first class, and
well remembered Miss Eastman as his one
girl classmate, of whom he kept track for
some time.

It was with poignant grief to the family of
Miss Eastman, as well as to herself, that, when
the high school course of instruction ended,



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



487



Harvard and other colleges tiiat welcomed the
boy graduates barred their doors against girls.
Therefore the unfortunate girl was compelled
to accept the resources of a seminary for young
ladies.

An eager desire for the most fundamental
mental training obtainable by girls led her, on
the advice of a favorite teacher, to enter a
State Normal School at West Newton. There
she fount! what she sought as to quality of
instruction. This pledged her to the work of
teaching, which was altogether congenial to her.
Directly after graduating, she was invited to
take charge of the high school at South Brook-
field, Mass. After two years she accepted
a position in the Boston High and Normal
School, where she remained several years.

When Arttioch College in Ohio opened, under
the leadership of the great educator and states-
man, Horace Mann, he urged Miss Eastman
and a classmate at the normal school to enter
as pupils. Notwithstanding their high esteem
for Horace Mann, the parents of Miss Eastman
felt that Ohio was too far away. After she
had become a teacher. President Mann invited
her to come as instructor in the preparatory
classes of the college, and she went to a most
interesting work, with mature pupils, most of
them by many years her seniors. She had a
class of very interesting and loyal students.
Here she remained till near the close of Horace
Mann's noble life.

Antioch, like Oberlin, which preceded it,
opened its doors, without restriction of race
or sex, something hitherto unprecedented in
history. But while Oberlin gave to women a
motlified course, presuming, it seems, on only
limited capacity in the female brain, or limited
need that the sex should be much educatetl,
Antioch, grown bolder and wiser, and with
Horace Mann at its head, offered the same cur-
riculum to all.

Says President George L. Gary, professor at
Antioch and later President of the Meadville
Theological School, "In the light of the expe-
rience of the last forty years it need harilly
be said that the women who responded to this
welcome needed to have no concession made to
their imagined inferiority."

He finely depicts Mr. Mann in these words:



"The most striking characteristic of Mr. Mann'.s
nature was his ethical passion. ... To feel that
a thing was right, either for himself or others,
was a challenge to its performance or to its
earnest defence, if nothing else was possible,
which he never allowed to go unheeded."

To a young teacher, close association with so
noble a nature as Horace Mann, and with those
his fine instinct ilrew around him, may well
be counted high privilege. Miss Eastman
counts especially, among the many recognitions
which she has so generously and so gratefully
received, one from President Horace Mann,
made shortly after her withdrawal from An-
tioch College:

Minister Sarmiento, Representative of Buenos
Ayres to the United States, advised President
Mann of the desire of his government to im-
prove its schools by the introduction of the
most approved methods in use in the United
States. He also asked him to suggest a suit-
able person to conduct such a work. Presi-
dent Mann wrote to Miss Eastman, to ask if
she would meet Minister Sarmiento to con-
sider with him the undertaking of such a work.
Miss Eastman felt, however, that more matu-
rity and wider experience than she possessed
at the age of twenty-five were required, unle.ss
a considerable time could be allowed for due
preparation; nor woukl her family consent to
the wide separation involved in her going so
far from home.

On returning to Lowell, she was given charge
of the girls' department of the high school,
numbering about two hundred pupils. After
several years in this position she was invited
to Meadville, Pa., as principal of a young lathes'
seminary, endowed by the benefactions of the
esteemed Huidekoper family. During seven
years of her stay here she was the happy sharer
of the home of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Huitlekoper.
One evening at a reception at the Unitarian
Divinity School a group fell into a conversation
which leil to some consideration of woman
suffrage. After the party was over, the stu-
dents met, and voted to invite Miss Eastman
to give her views on the subject more fully in
their chapel, and appointed a committee to
extend the invitation. A fine audience gath-
ered, and this was her first public address.



488



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



On returning to Massachusetts she was in-
vited by Mrs. Lucy Stone to deliver the address
in New England. This inaugurated a work
of many years throughout the country and its
adjacent provinces that was prosecuted from
the platform and occasionally from the pulpit.
This work proved of the deepest interest to
Miss Eastman, antl, judging from the unani-
mous tone of audiences and press, her listeners
found it no less so. It soon became an open
question with her whether to abandon the con-
genial educational work for that of the plat-
form. She reminded her mother, who was
naturally chary of her daughter's reputation,
that in advocating an unpopular cause she
should pass out of the accustomed sphere of
general sympathy and probably meet criti-
cism and even misrepresentation, and asked her
if she could bear it. Her mother felt most
keenly the need of service along the line of the
new departure, and replied, in the brave spirit
of the mother of the Gracchi, " It will be hard,
but I can endure even that better than I can bear
to have you reach my age and feel, as I do,
that I have seen all my life the great harm to
both men and women which this non-repre-
sentation of women works, and yet have done
nothing to correct it." In this the mother was
mistaken, for within the limits of a private
sphere she had valorously and with rare in-
fluence championed the cause of equal rights
and opportunities, in which she had the sym-
pathy of her husband. The world was kinder
to her daughter than she had dared hope,
for these heroic souls, Lucy Stone, Susan B.
Anthony, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and
Mrs. Livermore, and their cotemporary peers,
with a dignity and a sweetness befitting their
cause, turned the sharpest point of their op-
ponents' steel.

From the platform she spoke along the lines
of reform in way of "Equal Suffrage," "Prog-
ress in the Aims and Methods of Education,"
"Rights and Wrongs of the Indians," "Duties
of Government," "Literature," "Travel," and
other miscellaneous topics.

Miss Eastman could scarcely have received
more encouragement than she did in her public
career, whether from her audiences, the press,
or from the leaders of thought throughout the



country. Her arguments were always logical
and given with candor. That she had the
faculty of captivating her audience is abun-
dantly shown, but it was accomplished by
no meretricious arts or display.

The Lawrence American said, " Miss East-
man's address displayed the thinking, philo-
sophic i)Ower of analysis of John Stuart Mill,
while the earnestness of her manner proved
clearly the earnestness of her sentiments."

The St. Louis Globe said: "Miss Howe ad-
dresses you. Miss Eastman talks to you.
With a subtle and effective sarcasm she laughs
you out of your prejudices. She reasons with
you. With an eloquence that stirs your blood,
she rouses you from your apathy; and, having
said all this and much more, she leaves the
platform, while the audience applauds her to
the echo."

The Pittsburg correspondent of the Cin-
cinnati Commercial said : " Miss Eastman is
undoubtedly one of the largest-brained women
in America. A clear, logical thinker and a
woman of scholarly training, she has thought
out for herself the questions with which she
deals, and she hits the nail on the head every
time.

"I did not say she was a ' ^rai'C woman ' : she
is one of the brightest, merriest women alive.
I said she was a grand woman, and I'd like to
say it again."

Colonel T. W. Higginson, in an article on
"How to Speak," after expressing the great
delight to his ear of listening to a perfectly
tlistinct and clear-cut utterance, says, "If
you wish to know what I mean by a clear and
satisfactory utterance, go to hear Miss East-
man speak." Again he says: "She is a thinker,
not a mere agitator. She always has something
fresh to Say, and her talk is up to the day."

Wendell Phillips, after listening to one of
her speeches, commented on her " words of
eminent wisdom."

Mrs. Howe contributes her word for the pub-
lishers of this book : " Miss ICastman is a woman
of superior culture and abiUty, eloquent with
pen and tongue. Her interest in public ques-
tions has made her gifts available for the bene-
fit of the community in which she has long had
her home. She ^^as always been an ardent



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



489



advocate of woman suffrage. She was a valued
officer of the Association for the Advancement
of Women, a pioneer company wliose wide-
spread labors did much to render possible
the general federation of women's clubs, which
now embraces every State in the Union."

Of Miss Eastman's success in the pulpit let
Robert Collyer speak, in the spirit of many
another: —

De.\r Miss Eastman:

I want to thank you for the sermon you preached
in Unity the other Sunday. It went to the heart of
the whole congregation. I have not spoken to a man
or a woman who is not of my mind — that it was one
of the best .sermons we have ever heard about the
immortal life. Permit me to say, too, that I believe
you can do great good as a preacher of the eternal
truth; and I trust you will give this no secondary
place in your life, but will think of the pulpit as your
true place. I am sure you will be welcome.

Miss Frances Willanl wrote her after one
of her speeches made in Illinois: —

My dear Mary:

Our good Dr. Jutkins, who has just called, says he
heard you with great pleasure in Lexington, Ky.,
years ago, and that "your brightness was not worn
like a jewel on a dark garment, but encompa.ssed you
like a luminous atmosphere."

Isn't that a nice one? Too good to keep.

Ever thine,

Frances.

Of herself Miss Eastman says, looking back
over her past life and writing in the retirement
of her plea.sant home in Tewksbury, Mass.:
" I seem to myself to have lived a life very
like that of other New England girls and
women, to whom came fortunate parentage,
neither poverty nor riches, and, being of New
England birth, the best opportunities the
world had to offer to its tlaughters in the way
of education and association, albeit, in view of
the exclusion of my se.x from its colleges, but
a tithe of the education which the eager girl of
that period hungered for. . . . When some one
asked me recently where I got my education,
with the colleges closed against me, I ought
to have said, 'At home.'"

That her life has been one of large and
powerful influence, especially in connection
with work for the advancement of woman,



those familiar with her career best know;
and those who have been privileged to
meet her in these later years best know in
what high degree she retains her powers of
thought and clear, forceful expression, and that
natural charm of manner that has always been
one of her most noticeable characteristics.



GERTRUDE QUINLAN, actress, was
born in Boston, Mass., February 23,
1880. She is a daughter of Michael
Charles and Ellen (Barret) Quinlan
and the fifth in a family of seven girls.

Michael C. Quinlan, her father, was a school-
master in Ireland, his native country. Since
he came to the United States and settled in
Boston, he has lived in retirement, engaging
in no active occupation.

Miss Quinlan was graduated at the Franklin
Grammar School in Boston in 1892, and during
the school year of 1893 she attended the Girls'
High School in that city. From the age of
four years she has sung in various church and
charity concerts, and, knowing that she pos-
sessed a natural and exceptional soprano
voice, she determined in her early years to
cultivate that gift and make it her means of
livelihood, whether it did or did not win her
a reputation in the operatic world.

Handicapped at the outset by a lack of
means to pay for the training necessary to
the most perfect voice and the added difficult}'
of overcoming the prejudices of father and
mother, not to mention other relations, who
held certain rigid opinions about a public career,
and that career the stage, for one of their own
kin, Miss Quinlan at twenty-three years of age
is a striking example of what may be accom-
plished by determined effort o£ will. Having
finally gained the reluctant consent of her
parents, with her mind centred upon a certain
goal, she entered the chorus of the Castle
Square Opera Company, singing at the Castle
Scjuare Theatre, Boston, in May, 1895. She
remained there one year, entering into the
hard work of learning the score of a new opera
each week, and rehearsing one for the follow-
ing week, while singing in two performances
daily, with such courage and enthusiasm that



490



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



she was very often taken from the chorus and
given some small part, only one or two lines,
yet an honor for a girl not sixteen and with
only a few months' experience.

In May, 1896, she accompanied the Castle
Square Opera Company to Philadelphia, and
sang with them at the Grand Opera House for
a year and a half. While there she became
understudy to Miss Clara Lane, and was often
called upon to sing her rAles without so nuich
as a rehearsal to give herself confidence.

Miss Quinlan's first appearance in New York
was at the American Theatre, January 17, 1898.
in "The Lily of Killarney," taking the part of
Anne Shute. During the following summer
she played one of the two principals in "Red,
White, and Blue," a war drama, with Mr.
Raymond Hitchcock, creating the character of
Hetty Hall, a little American girl, the com-
pany making a tour of the small cities around
New York.

This was followed by "Shenandoah" at
the Academy of Music, where she character-
ized Junie Buckthorne, the General's daughter,
until in the summer of 1901 she rejoined the
Castle Square Opera Company at the Stude-
baker Theatre in Chicago, 111. She sang in
Chicago two seasons.

Miss Quinlan has sung in over one hundred
and twenty-five operas, and has played all the
principal soubrettc parts in the same. She
made her first distinct success as Broni Slava
in the "Beggar Student," and became an es-
pecial favorite as Pitti Sing in the "Mikado"
while in Chicago. She is also a piquant come-
dienne, and with her pretty voice and pleasing
stage manner has made astonishing progress
toward marked fame since her appearance
in the comic opera, "Tarantella," as Junie, in
1901.

• The next year she was given the part of
Annette in the cast of "King Dodo," and dur-
ing the season of 1902-1903 she pleased every
one as Chiquita at the Tremont Theatre in
Boston and Wallack's Theatre, New York.

She has always been under the management
of the Castle Scjuare Opera Company, and has
rendered them several important services,
which naturally advanced her in their estima-
tion and in her profession.



Once in Philadelphia, while "The Princess
Bonnie" was being sung, Kitty Clover lost
her voice in a most unexpectetl manner, and
coukl not sing a note. Miss Quinlan imme-
diately grasped the situation, and, although
in student costmne, came to the front of the
stage, and, placing her arms around the voice-
less songstress, sang the solo, transposing the
words to give proper meaning to her rendi-
tion. Another time, in "Mignon," the prima
donna, who sang the part of Filina, did not
answer her cue, and after a hurried search
could not be found. Miss Quinlan stepped
into the gap, singing the lines to perfection,
and again saved the evening. This latter
act proved to be her emancipation from the
chorus.

Miss Quinlan is not a member of any societies
or clubs, but a most devoted parishioner of
the Roman Catholic church. Her voice has
had constant care and cultivation since the
day she first entered the chorus. It has been
trained under Franklyn Smith, of Boston,
Mr. Frederic Bruegger, of Chicago, and Mr.
Karl Brenneman, of New York.



CLARA MARCELLE GREENE (Mrs.
Wyer Greene), author, a native of the
Pine Tree State, residing in Portland,
was born in Bucksport, and was there
reared and educated, being successively pupil
and teacher in the seminary at that place.
From childhood she has been a lover of books,
and many a student acknowledges a debt of
gratitude to her for her wise advice and direc-
tion as to their choice of books. She relin-
quished the cares of the school-room when she
became the wife of a Portland merchant, Mr.
Wyer Greene, and has since resided in that
city. Mr. and Mrs. Greene have a son and
daughter, the latter a fine musician. For a
number of years there have appeared in sev-
eral magazines stories and verses from Mrs.
Greene's pen that show marked talent. A vol-
ume of her poems, published a few years ago,
was received with favor. Her health, never
robust, has, however, at times made literary
work impossible for her. Mrs. Greene is a
member of some of the literary clubs in Port-

land, and numbers among her acquaintance
several prominent New England authors. The
poet Whittier spoke favorably of her talent.
A Christmas story entitled "The Children,"
published in Christian Work, 1902, and a serial
illustrating the laws governing a wife's dower,
which was run in the Portland Transcript
several years ago, show with what fine sym-
pathy she understands the inner nature of
women and children, and with what nicety
she depicts their individual traits of character.



HARRIET STANLEY LAMBARD, of
Augusta, Me., well known for her con-
nection with philanthropic work, was
born in that city, April 24, 1837. Her
father, George Washington Stanley, was a native
of Attleboro, Mass., but spent most of his life
in Augusta. Her mother, in maidenhood Mary
Dearborn, was a native of Winthrop, Me.

Harriet Stanley, as a child, was a pupil in
private schools of Augusta, going later to Boston
and Belmont for further training. When in
her teens she attended the Congregational
Female Academy in Augusta. Although her
family were Unitarians, she became an inter-
ested attendant of the Episcopal church, at
the age of eighteen joining St. Mark's, of which
she is still an active member. In 1SS4 she was
married to Thomas Lambard. Mr. Lambard
died in 1892. Since his death Mrs. Lambard
has resided at her home on A\'inthrop Street,
having as members of her household a niece
and nephew. She enjoys society, but does
not care for clubs. Much of her time is given
to travel. She is fontl of journeying in her
own country, and claims that not for scenery,
health, or pleasure need the American go
abroad.

Since the establishment of the Old Ladies'
Home in Augusta, Mrs. Lnmbard has been on
its Board of Managers, and she is now holding
the office of Vice-Presitlent. When Augusta's
City Hospital was incorporated, and the Hos-
pital Aid Society was formed, Mrs. Lambard
was elected President. In that capacity she
faithfully served until 1901, when she resigned.
As a willing helper and most generous donor,
her name will always be associated with the



institution. In its few years of existence this
hospital, at the State capital, has a record that
places it among the most useful and most ad-
mirably conducted institutions of its kind in the
State. When it was first opened, in 1897, the
work was carried on in a rented building,
but in 1900 the closing of the Girls' School at
St. Catherine's Hall gave the directors an op-
portunity to purchase a building well adapted
to hospital recjuirements. "It is a large and
noble-looking structure, built in the beautiful
old colonial style of architecture, and situated
on an elevation, which secures not only the
sanitary advantages that come from perfect
drainage, but sunshine and pure air." It
commands a superb view of the Kemiebec
valley, and is an ideal home for the sick. Its
equipments are all modern and first-class, the
staff able and the directors may well claim
that "there is not a hosj)ital in the country
that is contlucted on broader lines or with a
more sincere ilesire to meet fully and fairly
all possible needs of the public it serves."



LILLIAN NORTON (Madame Nordica)
was born in Farmington, Me., Decem-
_^ ber 12, 1857, the daughter of Edwin
and Amanda E. (Allen) Norton. Her
maternal grandfather, the Rev. John Allen, was
known everywhere as "Camp-meeting John,"
such gatherings, in several hundred of which
he took part, having a peculiar charm for him.
He was an interesting and original preacher,
and was distinguished for his wit and ready
repartee. He served as chaplain in the Maine
House of Representatives in 1879 and 1881.
Madame Nordica's mother was a woman of
broad intelligence and marked executive ability.
Christian graces adorning her character.

As a bit of old New Englaml history it is
interesting to note that Nordica's great-grand-
father, Nathaniel Hersey, was in 1777 taxeil
for his "faculty," with four other citizens of
the town, who were regarded as possessing
marketl business capacity.

W'hen Lillian Norton was but a child, her
parents removed to Boston. She inherited
from both father and mother a talent for music,
and at the age of fifteen she began the culture

of her voice with Professor John O'Neil of
Boston, continuing under his instruction until
she went to Europe. In Milan, where she
studied under San Giovanni, she was given her
stage name of "Giglia Nordica," the Italian
for "Northern lily." Under Giovanni's teach-
ing she prepared herself for opera, making her
debut as Violetta in the opera of "Traviata."
Her first engagement of importance was at St.
Petersburg, where she sang for two seasons,
achieving a brilliant reputation. From that
city she went to Paris, where she appeared as
Marguerite in "Faust," at the Grand Opera
House. After sii\ging there several months,
she married Mr. Frederick A. (Jower, and soon
retired from the stage.

After Mr. Gower's death in 1884, she appeared
again in opera at Covent Garden, London, and
in all the principal opera houses of Europe and
America. Up to this time Nordica had con-
fineti herself to French and Italian roles, but
during a visit to Bayreuth in 1893 she was
asked to create the role of Elsa in " Lohengrin,"
and, learning the German language in five
months, made her appearance at the end of
that time. She elicited much enthusiasm, and
it was a season of triumph. Her repertoire
now embraces forty operas and all the stand-
ard oratorios. She is best known in Wag-
nerian parts. In the United States she has
appeared in grand opera several seasons.

She speaks fluently all the languages in which
she sings. Personally she is a woman of much
charm and magnetism, as well as beauty. She
has a gracious manner, and is especially loyal
to her old friends.

She married a few years ago Herr Zoltan
Dome.

She takes an interest in her native State, and
from time to time visits her birthplace.



CHARLOTTE AUGUSTA BRIDGES
LEE, for some twelve years or more,
until her death on December 24, 1903,
a resident of Auburn, Me., was born,
brought up, and educated in New York City,
being a daughter of Charles and Harriet (Her-
vey) Bridges. On September 11, 1866, she
married Stephen Lee, and subsequently resided



at different times until 1890 in New York and
Brooklyn. The family then removed to Au-
burn, Me.

Mr. and Mrs. Lee had two children,' Herbert
Stephen and Edith Enmia, both born in Brook-
lyn, N.Y. Mrs. Lee was a member of the Con-
gregational church. She was a director in the
Women's Christian Association and the Social
Settlement, and took an active interest in the
philanthropic work in which these organiza-
tions are engaged. She served acceptably as
president of the Auburn Art Club and of two
literary societies, Sorosis and the Literary
Union of Lewiston anfl Auburn.



MARY ABBY FELTON WHIT-
MARSH, Ph. G.— While in Ger-
many the woman druggist has been
a familiar figure for years, in Amer-
ica she is an exceptional person. To one
woman who chose this vocation a large share
of success has come, and it will be interesting
to glance at her history. Her maiden name
was Mary Abby Felton Stiles. In 1873 she
became the wife of Daniel Webster Whitmarsh,
of Middleboro, Mass.

Slie was born in Barre, Worcester County,
Mass., August 22, 1853, the daughter of Joseph
Henry and Mary Amelia (Felton) Stiles. Her
father, a native of Worcester, Mass., died in
1862. He was the son of Henry and Avis
(Williams) Stiles and a lineal descendant, sev-
enth generation, of Robert' Stiles, of Rowley
Village (now Boxford, Mass.), who married in
1660 Elizabeth, daughter of John' Frye, of
Andover. From Robert' and Elizabeth the
line continued through Timothy^ and Hannah
(Foster) Stiles; Jacob^ and Sarah (Hart well)
Stiles, of Lunenburg; Captain Jeremiah* and
Mary (Sanger) Stiles, of Keene, N.H.; Jeremiah,
Jr.,^ and Abigail (Bridge) Stiles, of Worcester;
to their son Henry," above mentioned.

The maternal grandparents of Mrs. Whit-
marsh were Nathaniel" and Abigail H. (Bowker)
Felton; and the Felton ancestry is traced
back through Nathaniel,^ Nathaniel,* Ebenezer,'
Nathaniel,^ to Nathaniel' Felton, the immigrant
progenitor, who came to Salem, Massachusetts
Bay Colony, in 1633, and who married Mary



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



493



Skelton, daughter of the Rev. Samuel Skelton,
the first minister of Salem.

Mrs. Mary A. Stiles was for years a teacher.
Her daughter, through her influence early in-
terested in good reading, was educated in the
schools of Barre (attending successively a dis-
trict school and the high school) and at Pierce
Academy in Middleboro (co-educational), then
one of the leading secondary schools of New
England.

Two subjects have always held Mrs. Whit-
marsh's attention, natural history and materia
medica. In studying the latter she grew more
and more attracted toward that branch of sci-
ence, and in the fall of 1896 she entered the
Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. After
one year's hard study — the rules of the school
necessitating four years' actual experience —
Mrs. Whitmarsh decided that such experience
should be in an establishment of her own.
Accordingly she fitted up a new store with fine
equipments at Geneva Avenue, Dorchester, to
which during the ensuing year she gave her
entire time and attention. In 1899 she re-
sumed her stutlies, dividing her hours between
school and her place of business. She was
graduated in 1901, receiving her diploma for
having satisfactorily finished the general course.
Since that time she has been absorbed in her
rapidly growing business. She is a popular
woman in her community, and is alike re-
spected for her ability and integrity.

Mr. and Mrs. Whitmarsh have always at-
tended the Congregational church. For clubs
she has no time, although in sympathy with
their work; and her duties make her but an
irregular attendant at the Daughters of Re-
bekah Lodge, of which she has been a member
for several years. Mr. Whitmarsh is a skilled
{)attern-maker in iron work.



VINA BOYNTON PEAKES, of Boston,
is an energetic business woman who
has achieved success in the field of
insurance. The necessity of earn-
ing her owm livelihood came about through the
death of her husband. After turning over in
her own mind the few profitable occupations
that offered honorable employment for women,



she decided upon insurance, and accordingly
studied the methods employed by men in the
presentation of that subject, striving in par-
ticular to acquire a direct and business-like
manner. Her efforts were successful, and,
step by step, she has advanced from her early
beginnings until to-day she stands as one of
the leading women insurance underwriters
of Boston, which city, it may be said, has the
only association of women underwriters in
the world. Mrs. Peakes is an independent
agent, not being connected with a women's
department. She approves of the admis-
sion of women to all professions and all suita-
ble lines of business, ami takes great pleasure
in noting the success they are achieving in
their various undertakings.



BOSTON WOMEN'S EDUCATIONAL
AND INDUSTRIAL UNION.— From
the present plane of woman's activity
in affairs it is difficult to appreciate
the courage and prescience of a small band of
women who in 1877, under the leadership of
Dr. Harriet Clisby, organized the Boston
Women's Educational and Industrial Union
" for the purpose of increasing fellowship among
women in order to promote their educational,
industrial, and social advancement." Dr.
Harriet Clisby was elected President, Miss M.
Chamberlin Secretary, and Mrs. S. E. Eaton
Treasurer. These officers, with four directors,
adopted a constitution whose foimdation was
so broad and deep that during the past quarter
of a century the Ihiion has always found an
open door for any work that "advanced the
Interests of women."

"A union of all for the good of all," there
was in its inception a deep vein of ethical pur-
pose, a tremendous initial impulse of faith,
religious fervor, and enthusiasm. It was born
in the days of few organizations and of limited
opportunities for women. The force of self-
expression was beginning to stir, but had to
force its way against the inertia of conserva-
tism.

In the faith of the founders of the Union
appeared a regenerating force to touch the
commimity to higher life. The Union came



494



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



into the world hampered by no preconceived
methods for future development: it simply
stood ready to respond to the opportunity
for service. This very lack of definiteness,
this plastic form, was at the outset, and con-
tinues to be, a source of strength, insuring a
sensitive response to the needs of the hour.

Constant through all these years, the Union's
ideal has been the uplift of women through the
character-building forces of association and re-
sponsibility; throvigh the inspiration and privi-
lege of service.

"The Union aspires to be that common
meeting-place where every woman stands on
the same level, and must therefore look straight
into the eyes of every other woman, seeing the
essential thing — character apart from material
or social conditions — a ground so level that
there can be no looking up or looking down,
where the permanent bond is that spiritual one
which blesses him who gives and him who
takes."

The successful progress of the Union has
been uniform. While rich only in ideals, its
financial credit was early secured by a rigid
adherence to a very primitive rule of " keeping
absolutely out of debt." The Union has never
asked help to meet an obligation already in-
curred.

At the outset the work itself, not yet grown
to unwieldy proportions, was well adapted to
claim the interest of volunteer committees,
whose living spirit and enthusiasm in those
early days was priceless; and they accom-
plished what paifl workers, untouched by their
tire, could never have done, in laying for the
l^nion deep and lasting foundations.

The magnitiide of the changes in conditions
which have necessitated changes in methods
is indicated in the following figures: In 1879
the assets of the Union were about one hundred
dollars, with no paid workers. In 1904 the
assets are two hundred and fifteen thousand,
five hundred and eighteen dollars, with a pay-
roll of one hundred and one. In the In-
dustrial Departments alone the change is
enormous. To-day (1904) the Union presents
the unique spectacle of a business that em-
ploys about seventy-five paid workers, with
annual receipts of one hvmdred and twenty-



four thousand, seven hundred and forty-seven
dollars, the whole practically distributed to
producers.

The Educational Department has charge of
the Perkins Lecture Course, where each year
varied and valuable lectures are given free to
L^nion members, and of other methods of in-
struction calculated to stimulate intelligent
thought and a high standard of work; and
each year it adopts such industrial class
work as shall best "help women to help them-
selves."

The ethical side of the Union work has fairly
kept pace with the other departments. The
Committee on ]']thics has during the past two
years aroused an interest which has resulted in
an Association for Promoting the Interests of
the Adult Blind in Massachusetts.

In the Employment Department is conducted
the work of the Domestic Reform League,
whose object is to emphasize the business
relation of employer and employee, and to
promote by careful investigation a better knowl-
edge of present conditions and to suggest
possible readjustments.

The Business Agency receives applications
for all employments other than domestic ser-
vice — as book-keepers, stenographers, nurses,
attendants, governesses, etc.

The Protective Committee investigates claims
for wages unjustly withheld from women, and
gives much needed counsel and advice on legal
matters. The Befriending Committee gives
friendly advice, sympathy, and aid to all women
who come to th(&gt;m in perplexity or need. The
province of the Social Extension Committee is
to provide facilities for the comfort and con-
venience of I'nion members and to express the
genuine, democratic Ihiion spirit of fellowship
and good-will. And thus an ever-lengthening
vista of opportunity for service lies open before
the Boston Women's Educational and Industrial
Union.

The present officers (1904) are: President,
Mrs. Mary Morton Kehew; Secretary, Miss
H. I. Goodrich; Trea.surer, Mrs. Helen Peirce;
with four \'ice-Presidents and twelve Direc-
tors. There is a membership of twenty-five
hundred.

DAUGHTERS OF THE REVO-
LUTION, COMMONWEALTH OF
MASSACHUSETTS.— This patriotic
society was organized in Boston on
February 26, 1894, its certificate of operation
being granted February 28, 1894.

Its objects are to keep alive among its mem-
bers and their descendants, and throughout
the community, the patriotic spirit of the men
and women who achieved American inde-
pendence; to collect and secure for preserva-
tion the manuscript rolls, records, and other
documents relating to the war of the American
Revolution, and provide a place for their pres-
ervation and a fund ior their purchase; to en-
courage historical research in relation to such
Revolution and to publish its results; to pro-
mote and assist in the proper celebration of
prominent events relating to or connected with
the war of the Revolution; to promote social
intercourse and the feeling of fellowship among
its members, and " to provide a home for
and furnish assistance to such as may be
impoverished, when it is in its power to
do so."

Any woman shall be eligible to membership
in the Daughters of the Revolution who is
above the age of eighteen years, of good char-
acter, and a lineal descendant of an ancestor
who (1) was a signer of the Declaration of In-
dependence, a member of the Continental Con-
gress, or a member of the Congress, Legislature,
or General Court of any of the colonies or
Scates; or (2) rendered civil, military, or naval
service under the authority of any of the thir-
teen colonies or of the Continental Congress;
or (3) by service rendered during the war of
the Revolution became liable to the penalty of
treason against the government of Great Britain;
provided that such ancestor always remained
loyal to American independence.

The initiation fee is two dollars, yearly dues
three dollars. Fifty dollars paid at one time
constitutes life membership.

March 17 is the day appointed for the an-
nual election of officers. The first State regent
was Mrs. Sara White Lee; treasurer, Mrs.
Kate H. W. Wead; secretary, Mrs. Susan L.
Stedman. The present board, elected March
17, 1904, is: State regent, Mrs. Adeline F. Fitz;



vice-regent, Mrs. Maria W. Daniels; recording
secretary, Mrs. W. Anna Heckman; correspond-
ing secretary, Mrs. Mary E. Nichols; treas-
urer, Mrs. Eleanor B. Wheeler; registrar, Mrs.
Elizabeth P. Holbrook; librarian, Mrs. Mabel
E. Priest; historian, Mrs. Alice M. Granger.
During each year regular and special meet-
ings of the society are held and pilgrimages
are made to historic places. Thirty-one
branches, known as chapters in Massachu-
setts, join in the work of the State Society and
also carry on special work in their several
localities, marking graves of Revolutionary
soldiers, and giving to schools the best books
on the" Revolutionary period and pictures of
important events ami persons connected with
the early history of the republic.

Eight students have been assisted by pay-
ment of atlmission fees to Hampton Univer-
sity, four scholarships have been given to
Berea College, and two Boston boys have been
supported at the George Junior Republic.

Pictures ami busts have been given to Paul
Revere School. The work for the Massachu-
setts Volunteer Aid Association and Cuban
educational fund is particularly worthy of
mention. Through the untiring efforts of
Mrs. Alexander M. Ferris, of Newton, with
the assistance of the State regent and chapters,'
Massachusetts sent a large contribution for
the monument at Valley Forge, which was
dedicated in October, 1901, by the General
Society, Daughters of the Revolution. The
General Society has its headquarters at 156
Fifth Avenue, New York City; the State So-
ciety, at the Colonial Building, Boylston Street,
Boston.

The special work of the society during the
past year, undertaken at the suggestion of
Mrs. Adeline F. Fitz, then vice-regent, was the
raising of funds for a memorial tablet to be
placed in the Boston Public Library. The
plan was ' successfully carried out, and on
May 3, 1904, while the General Society, by
invitation of the State Society, was hold-
ing its annual meeting in Boston, a bronze
tablet, the work of the artist, C. W. Harley,
placed in the music room of the library, was
imveiled in the presence of an appreciative
audience.



■196



REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND



The tablet bears this inscription : —

The Daughters of the Revolution, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, in grateful recognition of patriotic verse
and song, commemorate these names: —

William Billings, father of American psalmody.

Oliver Holden, author of "Coronation."

John Howard Payne, who wrote "Home, Sweet
Home."

Samuel F. Smith, who wrote "America."

Francis S. Key, author of "The Star-spangled Ban-
ner."

.George F. Root, who wrote "The Battle Cry of
Freedom."

Julia Ward Howe, author of the "Battle Hymn of
the Republic."

Mrs. Howe is the only living member of the



group. There is a rule forbidding the use of
the name of a living person on any memorial
erected in the library. But the circumstances
were deemed such as to warrant the breaking
of the rule once.

The presentation speech was a neat address
delivered by Mrs. Adeline F. Fitz, and the gift
was accepted by the Rev. Dr. James De Nor-
naandie on behalf of the library trustees.

The veil was removed by Miss Minnie Scott,
great-grand-daughter of William Billings, au-
thor of the "Colonists' Rallying Song."

The audience arose en nuifise and applaudeil
when Mrs. Howe was presented and recitetl
her "Battle Hymn of the Republic."
