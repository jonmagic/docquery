ing. Orders were received from the best and most influential families, among them the Blaines. Mr. Blaine was Speaker of the House at Washington in 1872; and Mrs. Blaine, need- ing some one to accompany her thither, as family assistant in various ways, proffered the situation to Miss Sanborn, who welcomed the [ileasant change. This proved a most delight- ful winter, as the generous and kindly ways of the family accorded her many privileges not usually vouchsafed to an employee. She went everywhere, saw everybody and everything worth .seeing, joining the family at their table and meeting their guests, a bit of education novel and broad. At the end of the session Mr. and Mrs. Blaine gave her a pass from Balti- more to California and return. She left at once for the sunny land. Making her home there with a brother and finding immediate emi)loyment at her trafle, she earned enough to travel the length and l)readth of that State, visiting among other places of note the Yo- semite Valley and the big trees. She made these journeys on horseback, after the manner of those days. In October of the same year she s))ent three months in the frontier .settlements of Kansas, and tarried in several other States, reaching Maine in the early part of 1873. In March she opened dressmaking rooms, with dreams of the Centennial in her mind, a dream that was realized and so thoroughly enjoyed that the larger plan for attending the Paris P]xposition in 1878 seemed feasible. As her aged parents on the farm were then in comfort- able circumstances, the trip was taken; and the three and a half months in England, Scot- land, and France were a never-to-be-forgotten pleasure.

Craving something beyond the walls of her busy dressmaking establishment, and having no special journey in view, in 1880 she took up the Chautauqua literary and scientific course of study by correspondence. Working busily in her rooms all day, this meant study for e^'enings and Sundays. In 1884 the two weeks' vacation found her at Chautauciua ready to be grad- uated in a class numbering fourteen hundred. Dr. Lyman Abbott delivered the address and awarded the ilijilomas. In this immense class Miss Sanborn ranked well.

Again application to business imtil her father and mother neede(^l her personal attention. In 1891 she bought a beautiful home on a high hill in Augusta, which she named "Ren Venue." Here her parents came from the lonely farm to live with her, and here, when the summons came, they "lay down to pleasant dreams."

For the past ten years, having built green- houses, she has carried on a most successful florist's business. Each year she has done something to improve the land and surround- ings, not the least of her enterprises being the drilling of an artesian well, five hundred antl sixty feet deep, and the erection of a tower, tank, and windmill, the whole costing not less than three thousand dollars.
