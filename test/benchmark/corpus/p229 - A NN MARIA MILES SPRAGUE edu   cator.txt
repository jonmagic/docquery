A NN MARIA MILES SPRAGUE, edu- / \ cator and philanthropist, is a sister X ^ of General Nelson A. Miles and a descendant of the Rev. John Myles, who came to New England about the year 1663 from Swansea, Wales, and settled in Swansea, Mass., so named at the incorpora- tion of the town a few years later. His death is thus recorded: "Mr. John Myles, pastor of the church in Swanzy, deceased February 3, 1682-3." His son, John Myles, Jr., who also resided in Swansea, Mass., was elected to the office of Town Clerk in May, 1670. Nathaniel, son of John Myles, Jr., was born, as recorded in the Swansea town register, 26th day, 8 mo., 1671; and James, son of John the younger and Mary, his wife, in April, 1674. Daniel Miles, a native of Pomfret, Conn., thought to have been of the fourth generation of this family, and son of a Samuel Miles, removed to Petersham, Mass., where he died early in 1777, his will being probated April 9. His .son, Joab Miles, died in Petersham in 1835 at the age of ninety- one years. Joab married Elizabeth Fitch, a descendant, it is said, of John Fitch, who

was captured by the Indians at Fitchburg, and from whom that city derived its name. A tablet to the memory of John Fitch may now be seen in Fitciiburg. Daniel Miles, born in Petersham in 1799, son of Joab, married Mary Curtis, of ^^'estminster, who was born in 1802. Both died in 1875. Daniel and Mary (Curtis) Miles had four children — namely, Daniel Curtis, Mary Jane, Ann Maria, and Nelson Appleton. The last named, in his interesting book, " Personal Recollections of General Nelson A. Miles," refers to his parents and ancestors as follows: —

" Physical and mental advantages were not the only ones for which 1 feel it a very pleasant iluty to render thanks to my honored parents. Simplicity of life, purity of thought and action, and high moral standartls were as character- istic of them as of their ancestors through many generations. My father, Daniel Miles, excelled in strength, resolution, boldness, antl the highest sense of honor. To the example of his sterling integrity, spotless character, and loyalty to country I owe whatever of aptitude I have possessed in meeting the stern realities of a somewhat tumultuous life in an exacting profession. My father's high qualities had been transmitted through five generations from the Rev. John Miles, a Welsh clergyman, who hail not only been a soldier of the Cross, but also a soldier of approved valor and conduct in the Indian wars.

" For many years he carried on a school 'for the teaching of granmiar and arithmetic, and the tongues of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, also how to read English and to write.' This ancestor's residence was strongly built, and when King Philip's War broke out, in 1675, it was fortified and became known as Myles's Garrison. There the colonial forces gathered at the first outbreak of Indian hostilities, anil the pastor became foremost in the defence of the settlement anil was chosen Captain. Having done valiant service in the war, he at the close resumed the duties of a country clergy- man.
