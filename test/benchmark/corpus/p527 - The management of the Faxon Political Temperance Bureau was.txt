The management of the Faxon Political Temperance Bureau was publicly transferred to Miss Brown on March 22, 1902, although for several years previous to that date she had been the directing spirit of Mr. Faxon's work. During his crusade in enforcing the liquor laws in his home city, Quincy, Mr. Faxon bi'ought more than five huntlred cases before the courts, the testimony in nearly all of which, both in the upper and lower courts, was taken by Miss Brown. This experience proved of inestimable value to her, and has been turned to good advantage in later years.

Nor is it alone in direct temperance work that Mr. Faxon has found a most helpful co-laborer in Miss Brown. In all of his great political battles she has proved to be a most efficient assistant. She took a prominent part in the famous Temperance Republican Con- vention in August, 1879, where plans were per- fected for the nomination of the Hon. John D. Long for the office of governor, an event to have taken part in which she has always re- garded as an honor; for, as she says, "John D. Long has always been a consistent temper- ance man. His record as a legislator and as an office-holder are perfectly satisfactory to the friends of the reform." Mr. Faxon very generously shares with Miss Brown the honors of his victory over the saloon forces in the city of Quincy. He has always maintained that

without her assistance he could never have achieved the grand and beneficial results that are apparent on every hand in consequence of the continuous and well-enforced policy of no license that has prevailed for the past twenty years in Quincy. For many years Miss Brown has prepared Mr. Faxon's articles for the press, besides editing all the circulars and pamphlets that have been issued from his bureau â€” millions of pages annually.

Probably the most notable work that Miss Brown has compiled, and which has proved to be of incalculable value to those whose duty it is to enforce the liquor laws, is the book en- titled "The Laws of Massachusetts relating to Intoxicating Liquors." The compilation of this work was a stupendous task and neces- sarily a most exacting one, since the volume was intended to be, as it is, a standard author- ity, to which public j)rosecutors might turn for information and advice. Li preparing it Miss Brown was obliged to make an exhaustive investigation of the liciuor laws passed by the Legislature, together with the court decisions rendered in cases of violation of those laws. So thoroughly did she do her work that it is safe to say there is not a law on the statute books pertaining to the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, nor a decision on the same, with which she is not familiar. Eleven editions of this book have Ikhmi published by Mr. Faxon, and to-day th(&gt; manual is in gen- eral use in courts and municipal offices all over the State.
