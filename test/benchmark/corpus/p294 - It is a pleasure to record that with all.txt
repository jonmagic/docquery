It is a pleasure to record that with all the outside work Mrs. Smith has accom])Hslied she has been a thorough housekeeper, true mother, and faithful wife.

In personal appearance Mrs. Smith is a

quiet, unassuming lady of medium size and height, with a low, pleasant voice and a pres- ence that is felt for strength and comfort if one is depressed and like "oil on the waters" if untler any undue excitement. The strength of character indicated in her face she claims for a heritage.
