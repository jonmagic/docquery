Not long after her husband's death Mrs. Flint returned to her native town, and made her home on an estate Mr. Flint had owned on Main Street. Here in a house beautifully lo- cated, overlooking Crystal J^ake and the cen- tral portions of Wakefield, she continued to re- side during the remaining years of her life. On this homestead farm she laid out a street, nam- ing it Charles Street, in remembrance of her

husband. The estate consisted of twenty-four acres, including the sightly elevation known as "Hart's Hill," which with its picturesque sur- roundings has since the death of Mrs. Flint been acquired by the town by purchase as a public park, and will in time become a charming resort.

Though removed from North Reading, Mrs. Flint cherished a loving remembrance of the town as having been the birthplace and lifelong home of her husband, and because of her own personal and pleasant a.ssociations with the kindly and intelligent people of the old " North Precinct," as it was known in the early days, when Wakefield, Reading, and North Reading were united in one municipality.

On this town of her love Mrs. Flint bestowed her tangible blessings in a golden shower, not in any unconsidered and impulsive way, but only after calm forethought and deliberation, seeking to ascertain what gifts would be of greatest and most lasting value. The first re- sults of her kindly thouglitfulness were mani- fest in laying the foundation for a public library. By the provisions of her husband's will the sum of one thousand dollars was to be offered to the town of North Reading, the income thereof to be used in the purchase of medals for excel- lence in the public schools. The execution of this laudable jnu'pose having l)een found im- practicable, Mrs. Flint, with the willing co- operation of the town, turned this becjuest into a gift to form the nucleus of a public liljrary. To this gift she soon after added two thousanil dollars and later one thousaml dollars more, to be a permanent fund, the income of which should be amuially devoted "for the benefit of said library."

In accepting the gift, the town adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved, That we, as a town, herel)y express to Mrs. Harriet N. Flint our grateful appreciation of the warm interest she has taken in the prosperity of our town, the culture of its citizens, and the edu- cation of our youth.

"Resolved, That we also gratefully recog- nize her interest in our welfare, as shown in her original gift of one thousand dollars to establish a library, and in adding to that gift two thousand dollars as a perpetual fund, to

tje known as iho Flint Memorial Fvuul, the in- terest of which is to be yearly expended in ailding to the Flint Library."

The year 1S75 was signalized by the crown- ing act of Mrs. Flint's consistent generosity in the gift to her adopted town of the commo- dious and comely structure since known as the Flint Memorial Hall. The edifice is pleas- antly situated in the centre of the town, and admirably adapted to the uses for which it is designed. The first story contains the Flint Library and the nmnicipal offices; the second story has a spacious, well-lighted hall, with a gallery and ante-rooms; and the ui)per floor, a large banquet room and other conveniences. At its dedication the Hon. George B. Loring, of Salem, tlelivered the principal address, fol- lowed by the Hon. Charles L. Flint and the Rev. Granville 8. Abbott.
