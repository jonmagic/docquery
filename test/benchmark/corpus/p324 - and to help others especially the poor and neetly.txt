and to help others, especially the poor and neetly, gentle in her manners, doing all this quietly and with the spirit of love, she was beloved by all. Of an active- mind, quick in- telligence, and a most genial disposition, Mrs. Seavey enlivened the home by her ready wit, and was a most agreeable companion in all social intercourse, retaining these qualities to the last of her ninety years of existence.

Inheriting in a large degree the characteris- tics of her Puritan ancestors — indepentlence in thought and action, enterprise, and energy, which grew with her growth and strengthened with her strength — at an early age, with jnipils mostly her senior, Martha Seavey entered Washington Academy. An institution old and well endowed, famous for its record of able in- structors and still more for the many distin- guished men and women it had trained and sent forth into almost every walk of life during the more than half-century of its existence, no better fitting-school could be found for one's life work.

Thus equipped with educational advantages, she went forth to make a way and place for herself in the workl, not unsuccessfully. A fine oi)portunity soon offered for the exercise of her gifts. A j'^oung minister, the Rev. Gil- man A. Hoyt, wanting a competent helpmeet for his chosen work, found in her the right woman, admirably suited to the high vocation. Thejf were married in East Machias, and im- mediately started for their new field of labor in the Far West. One year of successful labor in Missouri and three more of arduous work on the prairies of Kansas wore out the life of the minister, leaving the young widow, with the addition of a rich experience, to begin life anew in a widely different sphere of activity. Boston offered the most inviting field, and with her pi'actical energy, natural business ability, self- reliance, and knowledge gained of the world, to win confidence and gain a permanent and lucrative position was not a diflncult task for Mrs. Hoyt. Here she found congenial occupa- tion in one of the prominent newspaper offices, where she labored with success until the death of her father called her away to the perform- ance of more sacred duties. With characteris- tic devotion she then returned to her childhood

home to make the lives of those most dear to her — an aged and feeble mother and an infirm sister — as pleasant and happy as unwearied at- tention and fidelity could effect.

The ancient homestead, standing apart from the village in a wide field, with its avenue shaded by evergreens, its scattered apple-trees tough and gnarleil with age, and its old oaken bucket hanging in the well by the kitchen door, was rejuvenated without, and the house bright- ened and adorned within. The aged mother, now quite weak antl helpless in body, was the centre of interest and the light of the home, while with faculties unimpairetl, cheerful and bright as in the earlier days, she enjoyed the society of her numerous friends and the evening readings, with their pastor, the Rev. H. F. Hard- ing, as their guest, in which Browning was the favorite author.
