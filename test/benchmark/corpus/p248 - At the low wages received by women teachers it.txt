At the low wages received by women teachers it took Lucy until she was twenty-five to earn the money to carry her to Oberlin, then the only college in the country that admitted women and colored men. Among most New Englanders Oberlin was unpopular, partly be- cause of its radicalism on the negro (juestion and the woman ciuestion, Ijut chiefly because the authorities of the college believed in the doctrine of "entire sanctification." It was re-

garded as a highly heretical place, ami the feel- ing against it was strong. Deacon White, of West Brookfield, took the Oberlin Emmjelist, but his wife would not touch the paper, and used to hand it to him with the tongs. Here or nowhere, however, Lucy had to get her col- legiate education.

She set out on the long journey to Ohio with only seventy dollars in her jnirse toward the expenses of the four years' course, but with her heart full of courage and her head of good conmion sense. Crossing Lake Erie from Buf- falo to Cleveland, she could not afford a state- room, l)ut slept on deck on a pile of grain sacks, among horses and freight, with a few other women who, like herself, could only pay for a "tleck passage." At Oberlin she earned her way by teaching in the preparatory depart- ment of the college, antl by doing housework in the Ladies' Boarding Hall at three cents an horn-. Most of the students were poor, and the college furnished them board at a dollar a week. But she could not afford even this small sum, ami during most of her course she cooked her food in her own room, boarding herself at a cost of less than fifty cents a week. Her father's disapproval of a collegiate educa- tion for girls finally gave way before his ad- miration of her sturdy perseverance, in which he perhaps felt something akin to his own character; and he wrote offering to lend her the money to carry her through the rest of her course, and urging her not to hurt her health by overwork. She would accept only a small sum, how(;ver, preferring to earn her own way as far as jiossible. She taught country schools during the vacations, and had some hard ex- periences, anmsing to look back upon, in the rough and primitive neighboi'hoods of the new West. Throughout her college course she wore cheap calico tlresses with white collars, launder- ing them herself, and being always so clean and trim that she used to be held up to the other young women by the members of the Laiiies' Board as an examjjle of how exquisite neatne.ss could go hand in hand with the closest economy. She had only one or two new dresses while at Oberlin, and she did not go home once during the four years; but she thoroughly enjoyed college life, and found time also for good works.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Ol)orlin was a station on the "underground railway," a town of strong anti-slavery sym- pathies, and many fugitive slaves settled there. A school was started to teach them to read, and Lucy was asked to take charge of it. The colored men, fresh from slavery and densely ignorant, still felt it beneath their dignity to be taught by a woman. Without letting her know this, the committee took her to the school and introduced her to them as their teacher, thinking they would not like to express their objections in her presence. But there was a murmur of dissatisfaction, and presently a tall man, very black, stood up and said he hail nothing against Miss Stone personally, but he was free to confess that he did not like the idea of being taught by a woman. She persuaded them that it would be for their advantage to learn from anybody who could teacli them to read; and her dusky pupils soon became nivich attached to her. When the Ladies' Boarding Hall took fire, during her temporary absence, many members of her colored class rushed to the fire, bent on saving her effects. She was told on her return that a whole string of colored men had arrived upon the scene one after an- other, each demanding breathlessly, "Where is Miss Stone's trunk?"
