Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote Mrs. Moulton that he was touched with the pas- sionate sincerity of her poems. " I cannot see," he added, " that the life of anient youth is dying out of you, or Hke to." Sincerity, in- deed, is the keynote both of her nature and her work. She is not methodical in her processes, never finding herself able to work through mere intellectual endeavor, unless some strong emotion stirs her to the tleeps. Thomas Hardy speaks of the poems in " The Garden of Dreams " as being penetrated "by the supreme quality, emotion." "It is not art but nature that gave her," said William Minto, "the spon- taneity and directness which are so marked characteristics of most of her poems, or that epigrammatic concision which enables her often to express in a sentence a whole problem or experience."

One of Mrs. Moulton's most appreciative, scholastic, and discriminating critics was Pro- fcs.sor Meiklejohn, who for twenty-seven years occupied a chair in the University of St. An- drews, Scotland, and who was the author of

a translation of Kant, of "The Art of Writing English," and other books of importance. He has said with authority that she deserved to be classed with the best Elizabethan lyrists in her lyrics, — with Herrick and Campion and Shakespeare, — while in her sonnets she might rightly take a place with Milton and Words- worth and Rossetti. "I cannot tell you how keen and great enjoyment (sometimes even rapture)," he wrote her, "I have got out of your exquisite lyrics." In a series of "Notes," following the poems, line by line, he asserted that the poet won her success liy the simplest means and plainest words, as true genius always does, and that her pages were full of emotional and imaginative meaning. Nature and Poetry uniting in an indissoluble whole; and Shelley himself, he said, would have been proud to own certain of the lines. The poem "Quest" he found so beautiful that, in his own words, it was "difficult to speak of it in perfectly measured and unexaggerated language." Of the poem "Wife to Husband" he said that " the tenderness, the sweet ami compelling rhythm, are worthy of the best Elizabethan days." The sonnet, "A Summer's Growth," "unites," he says, the "passion of such Italian poets as Dante with the imagination of modern English." This was in relation to her first voUune, "Swallow Flights"; and in conclusion he said: "This poet must look for her brothers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries among the noble and intense lyrists. Her in- sight, her subtlety, her delicacy, her music, are hardly matched, and certainly not sur- passed by Herrick or Campion or Crashaw or Carew or Herbert or Vaughan."

Of poems in the next volume, "The Garden of Dreams," Professor Meiklejohn affirmed that the perfect little gem, "Roses," was worthy of Goethe, and that "As I Sail" had the firnmess and imaginativeness of Heine, the perfect sim- plicity containing magic. "Wordsworth never wrote a stronger line," he said of one in "Voices on the Wind."
