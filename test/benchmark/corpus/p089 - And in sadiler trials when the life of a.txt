"And in sadiler trials, when the life of a sol- dier whom she had watched and ministered to was trembling in tiie balance between earth and heaven, she has .seemed, by some special grace of the Spirit, to reach the living Christ and draw a blessing down as the shining way was opened to the tomb. I have seen such looks of gratitude from weary eyes, now brightened l^y visions of heavenly glory, the last of many recognitions of her ministry. Absorbed in her

work, unconscious of the spiritual beauty which invested her daily life — whether in her kitchen, in the heat and overcrowtling incident to the issues of a large special diet list, or sit- ting at the cot of some poor lonely soldier, whispering of the higher realities of another world — she was always the same presence of grace and love, of peace and benediction.

"I have been with her in the wards where the men have crave;l some simple religious service — the reading of Scripture, the repeti- tion of a psalm, the singing of a hynni, or the offering of a prayer — and invariably the men were melted to tears by the touching simplicity of her eloquence."

In June, 1865, she was performing service in a hospital at Richmond, \a., and subsequently she worked with the same earnestness in schools for white and coloreil people in that city.

Returning to Ma.ssachusetts broken in health, .she spent some time in a sanitarium. She was married October 11, 1866, to Hamilton O-sgood. She died in Newton, Mass., April 20, 1868. The commemorative services, held in the Uni- versalist Church in Chelsea on Sumlay, April 26, were interesting and impressive, and attended by many friends, including sold rs and other army associates. Dr. Leonard, in his sermon from the text, "She hath done what she could," spoke of her beautiful life as complete in three stages — preparation, work, rest. Two hymns — "Nearer, my God, to Thee," and "Rest'for the Weary" — were hymns that had been favorites with Miss Gilson: she had often sung them in the hospitals.

Among the appreciative words called forth by her passing were these, dated May 13, 1868, written by the Rev. Clay MacCauley, who had been an army chaplain. They are here copied from the Christian Register: "How well I re- member her! We first met in I leasant Valley, Md., October, 1862, soon after the battle of Antietam. She was then giving the wealth of her mind and heart to the sick and woundeil soldiers in an old, cheerless log barn we tried to call a hospital. What a beautiful minister of goodness she was! There on that hard thresh- ing-floor she could be seen constantly, often sitting beside the sick, speaking tho.se words of comfort, smiling those sisterly smiles, read-

ing those 'words of life,' singing those songs of home, country, and heaven, which gave to her the name, 'Sweet Mi.ss Gilson.' We all loved her. I am sure she made home dearer, life purer, and heaven nearer to every one of us. When, as it happened so often, some spirit was about to be released from its bonds, she always took a place beside the dying one and received the farewell messages. Then, with her pale, uplifted face, always beautiful, but never so beautiful as when it lay back looking into the workl to which she has herself now gone, .she bore the departing soul by the power of faith to its rest. They were no false tears she sheel. They were no false words she spoke. Never seemed touch more gentle than hers. Never seemed step so light. It was brightness at her coming and sadness at her going.
