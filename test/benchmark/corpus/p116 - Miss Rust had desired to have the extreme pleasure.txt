Miss Rust had desired to have the extreme pleasure of proving the benefit of the system by taking the children on in these advanced classes after the kindergarten stage, and it is now a great source of delight to her to look back upon this experience, and also to receive voluntary testimonials like this from pupils who have passeil (jn through other schools to the Boston Institute of Technology: "We did not know what was being done for us. Miss Rust, when we were little fellows in your kin- dergarten, but now we realize what it meant for us all along the line and here in our instruc- tion." In order to have justice done to this system, the child must have it as a whole. Thus much time and waste of nervous energy are saved in the higher grades.

In the meantime the school had grown to such a size that a hou.se was taken, and Miss Rust associated henself with a kindergarten-trained mother, they together undertaking the estab- lishment of a Kindergarten Normal Class for young ladies. Mi.ss Rust modestly felt that this mother, being older and more experienced in life, was better fitted than herself to under- take the responsibility of training young la- dies, although urged to do it. She, however,

assisted this mother. After a while the health of the mother failed, and the class was con- tinued for one year, being finished by the assistance of one of its older pupils.

At this tinie it was deemed advisable to "estab- lish a school in a new location out of the city, with larger grounds and surrounded by the beauties of nature. A location quite near Bos- ton was decided upon as being the most desirable and delightful one for a class of this kind. A kindergarten was soon started by Miss Rust, and after three years' time here again were the different classes above the kinder- garten department. It was impossible to se- cure suitable rooms for the size of the school, and for this reason for a time the school was limited to nearly one-half, consequently the patrons decided to build a model build- ing, with the understanding that Miss Rust should hire the building and carry on her school, as before, in a much improved way, and more in harmony with her ideas of a model Froebelian school, as all the work was based upon the Froebelian principles of educa- tion.

During the summer Miss Rust was often con- sulted as to the best arrangement of the build- ing, and helped in its plans, .she coming for this purpose several times from the seashore at Magnolia, where she usually passed her sum- mers, having nature-study classes, thus collect- ing specimens of sea flora, minerals, and so forth, for the fall classes of the new school.

This building was soon accomplished, the promoters using the name of Miss Rust in sell- ing shares. Sixty shares at one hundred dol- lars each were soon sold, mostly to patrons of the school, with the understantling that the money was to be used for her school. Unfort- unately, one who had financial rather than edu- cational interests at heart, and who had with a view to this purpose bought up a number of shares of the stock, decided that other ar- rangements should be made, and that, while Miss Rust should occupy the building, she should be allowed to do so on a salary, and they would own the school. This Mi.ss Rust in a dignified manner positively refused to do, say- ing she had built a school and they had built a building, and she preferred to have nothing
