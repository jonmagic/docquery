REPRESENTATHE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

with her little ones, at a time when the voyage in stormy weather sometimes extended over a spaee of fifteen or sixteen days, and the perils and hardships of the ocean had not been ameli- orated to the extent which obtains at present.

lu her early life abroad Mrs. Gifford imbibed a taste for foreign literature, foreign languages, and foreign travel, which sha])ed her subse- quent career. She has since travelled exten- tively over Europe and the Orient, many of the countries visited having been but recently made accessible to the traveller. Her plans and tours have been all marked out in advance, and her research has been so thorough that the maj) of Europe to her is like an illuminated book, even the unaccustomed routes being like the beaten track in her own garden. She has delighted the public with a large foreign cor- respondence, her vivitl imagination making the scenes of these various countries and the customs and habits of the jieople stand out before her readers like familiar experiences, her interesting and practical relations furnishing much valuable information to other travellers.

Since 18. 3, after the death of her eldest child, Katherine, born in 1870, a young lady of lovely character, Mrs. Gifford has found great solace in literature. In her first travels through Germany, fascinated bvGerman life and the people, she con- ceived the idea of putting into form a racy ac- count of the Germans from their beginning; and from this idea was developed the series of books, beginning with "Germany: Her People and Their Story," published by the Lothrop Publishing Company in 1899. It is as readable as a romance, one of its great merits being tliat its historical facts have an attractive setting. Evidently prepared with reference to the re- quirements of the general reader, it is something more than an outline of the salient features in the progress of the German nation from bai- barism to enligiitenment, from a confederacy of loosely allied states to a strongly cemented empire. Legend and anecdote have been skil- fully woven into the story, and vivid glim])ses are given of the national life, and a clear insight into the national character. It was a difficult task the author had before her of condensing within the limits of a six-hundred-page vol- ume twelve hundred years of a nation's growth.

There was danger on the one hand of making the volume little more than a chronological record, ami on the other of inadequacy. The success with which she has avoided both dan- gers attests a fine sense of proportion, discrimi- nating judgment, and much literary skill.

"Mrs. Gifford's 'Germany' was received with so much favor by both the people and her pub- lishers that she was encouraged to go on with the series. She has now for several years been collecting material abroad for her 'Italy,' vis- iting tliat country many times in order to ab- sorb all the phases of Italian life and character; and 'Italy: Her People and their Story,' bids fair even to excel the first of the series in in- terest."
