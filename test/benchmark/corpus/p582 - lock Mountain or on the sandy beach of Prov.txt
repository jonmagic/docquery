lock' Mountain or on the sandy beach of Prov- incetown, I have felt, as never before, that the future good of our country was assured by reason of the noble, earnest women who com- prise our membership.

Mrs. Rockwood journeyed to Califor- nia with the official party of the Department of Massachusetts, Grand Army of the Republic, and Woman's Relief Corps, and served as a delegate at the convention in San Francisco. She made an extended tour in the State, and was the recipient of many courtesies from friends.

At the convention held in Boston February 11 and 12, 1892, Mrs. Rockwood was chosen a member of the Department ExeGlitive Board. She has continued her visits to corps, partici- pating also in Grand Army gatherings, public meetings, and receptions. Her remarks on these occasions are always interesting, and their effect is aided by her pleasing manner. At the annual convention, February, 190.3 (having previously declined to be a candidate for the office of Junior Vice-President), she accepted an appointment as Department Patriotic In- structor, conferred by Mrs. Clara H. B. Evans, Department President. Mrs. Rockwood is a National Aiile in the W. R. C. She is now doing active work in preparing for the National Eiicnmpment of tlic G. A.

NINA K. DAKLINGTONE AND DAUGHTERS

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

NINA KELTON DARLINGTONE, the author and originator of a system of musical training and instruction copy- righted under the title of " Kindergar- ten Music-Building; the S'cience of Music, Art, and Education."

To picture for the public the essentially selfless toil and privations of an originator and philanthropist in any work is hardly possible: only those who have passed through the strug- gle know the cost. A glance at the system of education, "Kindergarten Music-Building; the Science of Music, Art, and Education," gives but a faint idea of its vastness and the painstaking labor that gave it birth.

Nina K. Darlingtone, though originally from Philadelphia, is descended through her mater- nal grandfather from New Englantl colonists. Tracing her ancestry, we find a long line coura- geously braving hardships, leaving their native land, becoming pioneers in a new country for conscience' sake, fighting in the early wars, holding responsible offices, conducting public affairs, and fearlessly tlevoting themselves to humanity's needs.
