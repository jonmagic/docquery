Thessalonica of the time of Saint Paul. Here, associated with Dr. House and Messrs. Baird and Haskell and their families, she carried on a noble work in that city, which in- cluded many conversions among the sailors from the British fleet, anchored for a time in Salonica Harbor. Miss Stone hatl heroically endured the heat of a Salonican summer, with the exception of one trip to Samokov, and had been to Bansko for a three weeks' training- school with her Bible women, when on return- ing thence, with an unusually large company of workers, she was seized by brigands. Her cap- tivity and final release on payment of a large ransom, to which we have already referred, are matters familiar to the reading public. Since her return home, some part of her time has been given to lecturing on missionary subjects, including her own personal experience in the missionary field. She is at present living quietly in Clielsea, Mass., devoting all her time to her aged mother.

1IZABETH A. TURNER, Past National President of the Woman's Relief Corps J and chairman of the board of directors of the Ander.sonville Prison property, is known throughout the country as a leader in patriotic work. Her paternal grandfather, John Thompson, was in the battle of Bunker Hill, and later was in the army stationed at Valley Forge. Her parents were Charles and Betsey Thompson, of Windsor, Conn., and until her marriage she was known as Lizabeth A. Thomp.son. She was educated in the public schools of her native town, now Windsor Hills.

In 1857 she was married to Y. F. L. Turner, of Georgia. Mr. Turner died three years later, and was laid to rest in the old cemetery at P(,rtland, Me.

At the breaking out of the Civil War Mrs. Turner was a resident of Boston. She packed the first box of supplies forwarded from that city to the soldiers at the front, and in 1863 she was a constant visitor to the hospital in Pem- berton Square, where the wounded sent from the battle-fiekls of the South received the kindest care.

On the 17th of March, 1880, Mrs. Turner was

admitted to membership in Major-General H. G. Berry Relief Corps, of Maiden, and was initiated by Mrs. E. Florence Barker, with whom she was subsequently associated as one of the pioneers of the National Woman's Relief Corps. Mrs. Turner held various offices in the corps at Maiden, and was its President two years. At the annual convention of the De- partment of Massachusetts, W. R. C, in 1883, she was elected to the office of Conductor. She was Jvmior Mce-President in 1884 and 1885 and Senior \' ice-President in 1886-87. In 1888 she declined to accept the honor of Department President, but consented to .serve as chairman of the Executive Board.
