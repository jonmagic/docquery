its interests. In the old days of the Unitarian Review many turned in every issue first of all to the section headed 'At Homo and Abroad,' articles which she wrote for that publication for many years.

"Besides the good work that Mrs. Lowe did and the influence she exerted, there was another salient feature in her life that no one who had any particular accpiaintance with her could fail to recognize. That was the sweet remembrance of her husband. Charles Lowe was the idol of her heart. To lovingly write the story of his life and work, to cherish his character and memory, to live over again unceasingly the hap])^ days and years in which they lived to- gether for causes dear to humanity and God, was her greatest joy and delight. ... A typi- cal Unitarian, she loved the church of Chan- ning. She was proud of its past, and had high hopes for its future.

" Mrs. Lowe was one of the clearest and most positive in her own expression of what she be- lievetl to be true. Her whole life and character was kindly, philanthropic, beneficent. Hhc sought to be useful and to _ do good in the world. Hence the large place and the wide and long-sustained influence she has had in this community."

SARAH ORNE JEWKTT, Litt.D.— An assured position among American men and women of letters has been won by Sarah (^rne Jewett in her thirty and more years of authorship, dating from her first contribution to the Atlantic Monthly, December, 1869. Miss Jewett is a native of South Berwick, Me. Born September 3, 1849, the second daughter of Theodore H. Jewett, M.D., and his wife Caroline, she still retains, with her sister Mary, her home in the well-known "Jewett House " at South Berwick, a comely and spacious mansion built in 1740, now rich in historical associations.

Miss Jewett is of iMiglish descent, traced through long lines of American ancestry, with a French strain inherited from her paternal grandmother. Her maternal grandparents were Dr. William and Abigail (Oilman) Perry, the grandmother a daughter of Nathaniel Gilman

and descendant of Edward Gilman, one of the earliest settlers of Exeter, N.H.

Dr. Theodore H. Jewett (Bowdoin College, 1834; Jefferson Medical College, 1840) was a man of note in his profession, nuich trusted and beloved as a family physician, and for some years a professor in the Medical School con- nected with Bowdoin College. Sarah, in her girl- hood, not being strong and needing all the out- door life possible, used often to accompany her father during his long drives to visit his country patients. Her reading and study received most of its direction at home, though at in- tervals she attendetl the South Berwick Acad- emy.

While yet of school age, she wrote for Our Young Folks and the Rivemide Magazine. F'or a few years, as witnessed by the index to the Atlantic Monllih/, 1857-76, she veiled her identity as an author under the pen name of Alice Eliot. " Deephaven," her first book, published in 1877, has been followed by several novels, as "A Country Doctor," "A Marsh Island," and "The Tory Lover" (1901); a number of volumes of short stories and sketches, including (not to mention them all) "Country Bv-ways," "Old Friends and New," "The Mate of" the 'Daylight' and Friends Ashore," "The King, of Folly Island and Other People," "A White Heron and Other Stories"; three stories for girls — namely, "Betty Leicester," "Betty Leicester's Christmas," and "Playdays"; and "The Story of the Normans," in Putnam's series of Stories of the Nations.
