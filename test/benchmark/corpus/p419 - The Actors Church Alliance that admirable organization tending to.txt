The Actors' Church Alliance, that admirable organization tending to bring about a closer understantling between the stage people and the rest of mankind, has a powerful counsellor and advocate in Miss Lawrence. To her per- sonal aid and enthusiasm is largely due the success of the Boston chapter, numbei'ing over four hundred members. Her good works are many, but are seldom tliscovered by any save the recipients. A great-hearted benevolence, ask- ing no questions, histant and constant in its sincerity, is one of her jjronounced traits.

Among Miss Lawrence's most cherished pos- sessions are an immense silver loving-cup, pre- sented her as a Christmas gift by patrons of the Castle Square Theatre; a girdle and cestus pendant, composed of sixty-nine fifty-cent pieces, engraved, which, together with a bag of gold and monogramed pieces, amounting

to five hundred (loll;ir.s, was presented to her on the memorable occasion of her farewcll-to- Boston a])pearanpe in 1900. Among the plays (far too numei'ous to he given in detail) in which she has sustained important rol(&gt;s may he mentioned "Tiie J&gt;ady of Lyons," " Frou Frou," "Captain Leltcrijlnir," "She Stooj)s to Conquer," "The Prisoner of Zenda," "Fe- dora," "Nathan Hale," "Under Two Flags," " Romeo and Juliet," " The Merchant of Venice."

CORA AGNES BENNESON, counsellor- at-law and s]iecial connnissioner. â€” Wherever in history a ]ieison is found whose ])lan of life has been drawn from within, whose course has been majiped out without precedents, that man or woman justly challenges attention. The last third of a cen- tury has furnished not a few women of inde- pendent thought antl action who have vindi- cated the right of each individual to do that for which he or she is fitted by nature. Younger women too easily forget the debt they owe these women of earnest conviction and liberal spirit.

To find Miss Benneson well established in the heart of a conservative conmiunity in what is for women a new profession, accorded on every hand jjrofessional and scholarly recogni- tion, allows one to judge of her initiative, in- tellectual power, and gentle persistence. Her youth fell at a period when women were be- coming active forces in society. Colleges and universities were being opened to them as well as to men. Girls were Ix'ginning to study, not because it was the fashion, but because they were impelled by an awakening self-conscious- ness.

The circumstances of Miss Benneson's birth and parentage made it quite impossible that she should be provincial or her oj)inions nar- i-ow. Th(&gt; conununity in which her eai'ly years were s])ent was made uj) of jjeople from all tile older ])arts of the country. Her father, liolx'i't Smith BciiiH'snn, went when a young man from Philadelphia to (^uincy. III., where he became an influciitiid and wealthy citizen. He w;is born in Newark, Del., the son of the Rev. Thomas and Jane (Carlyle) Benneson

(name originally Benson). He was of a strong, long-lived family, and seemed always to be the embodiment of health and good cheer. Be- cause of his integrity and ability as a financier he was naturally called to positions of trust. He combined the keen insight of a man of affairs with an nctive iidcrest in matters of public moment, es])ecially education. Through his efforts the original act levying taxes for school {purposes in Illinois was passed by the L(&gt;gislature. For fourteen years he was presi- dent of the Boanl of l']ducation of Quincj', a longer time one of its members. While Mayor he i)re,'-erved the credit of that city by giving his personal notes for its debts.
