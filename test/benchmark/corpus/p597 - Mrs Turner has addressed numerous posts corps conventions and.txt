Mrs. Turner has addressed numerous posts, corps, conventions, and other patriotic gather- ings in all parts of the State. She is' especially popular as an installing officer and as a member of committees where executive ability is re- quired.

In 1883, when the National Woman's Relief Corps was organized at the National Encamp- ment of the Grand Army in Denver, Col., Mrs. Turner, who rendered invaluable service in securing the adoption of the Massachusetts work and ritual, was elected National Treasurer. She was re-elected seven years in succession, during which time she managed the finances with great ability. She was elected chairman of the National Executive Board in 1889 and National Senior Vice-President in 1890, when the convention was held in Tremont Temple, Boston.

She was treasurer of the Executive Committee of Arrangements for this convention and chair- man of the Committee on Accommodations.

In 1891 Mrs. Turner was invited to be a can- didate for the office of National President, but declined. She consentetl, however, in 1895, and was unanimou.sly elected that year at the con- vention in Louisville, Ky. She established headquarters at 29 Temple Place, Boston. The work of her administration met with universal approval. In the address which she presented to the annual convention at St. Paul, Minn., over which she presided in 1896, referring to patriotic teaching, she said: ''This is one of

the fundamental laws of our order. In fact, it is one of the strongest planks in the Woman's Relief Corps platform. Our success- ful work along that line for the last four years has been even greater than the most enthusi- astic workers ever anticipated."

She made an extended Southern tour during her year as National President, visiting the colored corps, and also going to Andersonville, in order to find out something definite about the place and its surroundings.

It being decided at this convention to assume control of the Andersonville Prison property, a board of directors was chosen, of which Mrs. Turner was elected chairman. Two years later, in reporting the work accomplished, Mrs. Turner said: "We now own all the stockade as well as all the earthworks and forts surrounding it. Suitable gates have been erected in all places needed except at the main entrance. A wide driveway has been cut around the grounds, just inside the fence, and wide gates erected at the north-east corner, that open out to a plantation road leading to the National Cemetery, one quarter of a mile away, where our heroes lie buried. Two bridges have been built over the creek, so that now one can drive the entire cir- cuit of our land, two and three-fifths miles.

"The forts all remain intact, and are covered with a growth of fine forest trees. . . . We have built a nine-room house, at a cost of over seven- teen hundred dollars, and put up a wire fence with gates, at a cost of five hundred and sixty- seven dollars; planted the prison pen with Ber- muda grass roots at an expense of one hundred and seventeen dollars; paid out in small sums, for extra help, tools, and sundries, about five hundred more; also paid salary of care-taker for seven months, and built two bridges."
