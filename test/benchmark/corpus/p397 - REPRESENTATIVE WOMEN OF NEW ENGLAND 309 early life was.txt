REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

early life was spent with her kinsfolk in Boston. She was a woman of brilliant intellect and char- itable and progressive ideas, antl a valued con- tributor to periodical publications. In the soldiers' relief work in New Orleans, in which she was ])roniinent during the war and after it, she passed through many scenes of excite- ment and horror. In 1864 she made a voyage up the Mississijjpi River on the steamer " Em- press," which was attacked by masked bat- teries, riddled with cannon shot, and disabled, the captain and several convalescent soldiers being killed, and the steamer only saved from falling into the hands of the Confederates by the arrival of the Unitetl States gunboat "Kineo." Mrs. Hyer died in Wisconsin in De- cember, 1SS8.

Among Mrs. Elliot's many thrilling experi- ences while in Texas was the raiding by Indians of a camp near where she was visiting, all the horses and cattle being stampeded.

Shortly after their arrival in New Orleans in the autunm of 1S62 Mrs. Hyer, Mrs. N. M. Taylor, Mrs. Elliot (then Miss Hyer), and other Union ladies of the city, at the suggestion of prominent Union men, organized the " Union Ladies' Sokliers' Aid Society," afterward called the "Union Ladies' Aid As.sociation," which attained a membershi|) of more than hfty of the loyal women of the city. Mrs. Hyer was elected president, Mrs. Taylor vice-president, and Mrs. Elliot secretary. The members of this society visited the hospitals and admin- isteretl to sick and wounded sfildiers, provid- ing them with lint, bandages, and other neces- sities and comforts. Among workers promi- nent in Ihis society were Mrs. N. M. "^Taylor, previously mentioned, who, though a strong Unionist, had a son conscripted into the Con- federate army; Mrs. Phoebe Farmer, the poet; Miss Kate Buckley, a teacher in the New Or- leans schools; Mrs. Dr. Kirchner; Mrs. and Miss Bai'nett; and others whose names are among the recognized women workers of the Civil War. Their badge was a miniature Union flag. This society published a little paper. The Acorn, with Mrs. Hyer and Mrs. Taylor as editors, devoted to the cause of Unionism in Louisiana. This paper received the approval and became one of the official organs of the

conuuanding general of the Department, and in it were published the official orders of the Army of the Gulf. Mrs. Elliot was a contrib- utor to this paper. The members of the soci- ety received from army surgeons instructions in their chosen duties. They also held public meetings in Lyceum Hall weekly, and on other evenings at private houses.

The Unionists of New Orleans formed a so- cial conununity of their own, and, by assemblies, receptions, and a cordial welcome to their homes, made the life of the Union officers and men in New Orleans more endurable and pleasant than it would otherwise have been.

The loyal men of New Orleans also formed an association in the interest of the Union cau.se, many officers of the army lu-ing members, among them Mr. Hyer and Mr. Elliot, both offi- cers of the Association'. Dr. A. P. Dostie, an outspoken Unionist antl a martyr of the New Orleans anti-Union riot of 1866, was a promi- nent officer of this and other loyal societies.
