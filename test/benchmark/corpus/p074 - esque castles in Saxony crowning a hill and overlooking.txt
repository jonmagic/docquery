esque castles in Saxony, crowning a hill and overlooking the town of Zwickau," had passed into the hands of an alien line. Miss Mary Phinney and Mr. Gustav A. Von Olnhausen were married in Boston by the Rev. Theodore Parker, May 1, 1858. The union was a happy one, but not of long duration, the death of the Baron (to give him his rightful title) occurring September 7, 1860.

Only a few months later began the great Civil War, arousing the patriotism of women and testing the heroism of men. Mrs. Von Olnhausen, deciding to enlist as an army nurse, received a commission through the efforts of Governor Andrew, but was required to pay her own travelling expenses to the South, as the United States government at that time had not sufficient funds for the transportation of additional army nurses. During the four years' conflict she rendered faithful services as a hospital nur.se under the direction of Dorothea L. Dix.

It may here be mentioned that in 1873 she was appointed first superintendent of the train- ing-school for nurses in the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, a position that she ably filled.

Sailing for Germany in 1870, shortly after the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, she offered her services to the military authorities there, who were not at first disposed to approve her appointment. After persistent efforts, how- ever, she received a commission as arniy nurse. In this capacity again she had many thrilling experiences, and her services were appreciated as invaluable.

The first of March, 1871, found her in charge of thirty wounded men in a hospital in Orleans, France. Peace had been declared, and an order had been issued for the German soldiers to evacuate France. Some of the wounded, however, were unable to be moved. When the thirty in charge of this faithful nurse no longer neeiled her care, she thought that her duties then were completed, and accordingly made arrangements to depart for Berlin. As she was entering the diligence en route for that city, a surgeon came running from the hospital and entreated her to remain, as sixteen wounded men had just arrived. She did not hesitate,

but in the midst of danger promptly resumed her work. The people of Orleans were enraged at the Germans, and the mayor of the city, realizing the danger to "the little Madam," as she was often called, gave her his protection. He acconipanietl her to the hospital every morning at six o'clock, and, when her duties for the day were finisheil, at nine in the evening, he called at the hospital and accompanied her to his home. These duties were continued for more than a month, and then the fifteen men who survived (one of the wounded having died) started on their way to Berlin, in charge of the Madam, by order of the military authori- ties. They were obliged to halt in secluded places for fear of angry mobs.

An interesting sketch of this journey was given in the Boston Globe, from which the fol- lowing is taken: "It was a strange procession that moved through the streets of Vendome. First came three dump carts, each carrying a n an who had undergone an operation the day before, ami who lay on the straw groaning with every motion. Behind was a diligence, on the floor of which sat a little American woman, surrounded by twelve badly wounded men, three of whom rested their weary heads in her lap.
