In 1853 Captain and Mrs. Newell anil fam- ily left Honolulu and returned to the Lhiited States. They made their home in Charles- town for a short time; but, when Captain New- ell returned to his profession, the daughters were placed at the West Newton English and Classical School, then in charge of the Rev. Cyrus Pierce and Nathaniel T. Allen. Here they' received the greater part of their educa- tion. Here they became interested in the anti-slavery cause and woman suiTrage, form- ing their own opinions anil broadening their thoughts.

In 1860, under adverse circumstances, the father having given his life to the ocean, the widowed mother and her daughters came to South Boston. After various struggles the Misses Newell began their work in the schools. In 1862 the subject of this sketch became a teacher in the Lawrence district. Later she was in the Norcross, and afterward was pro- moted to the position, of first assistant in the Cyrus Alger Primary School.

In January, 1882, Mrs. Newell died, and her death was followed, in February, 1883, by that of the daughter Ophelia. Thus deprived of tliose whose lives had been hitherto so closely connected with her own. Miss Newell threw her energies more strongly into the cause of woman. She has been a firm believer in her sex and an advocate for woman's advancement

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

in all directions. Miss Newell is a woman of broad Christian spirit and an earnest worker in the Unitarian church. She has been and is an active worker in many lines. She organ- ized the Mattapannock Club of South Boston, which has a representative membership and is a benefit to the district. Miss Newell is a strong suffragist. When Mrs. Julia W^ard Howe organized a branch in South Boston, she and her mother and sister were some of the first to respond. Mi.ss Newell was a mem- ber of the first Ward and City Committee in the early days of women's voting and among the first to cast her vote.

She was among the first to become inter- ested in the Associated Charities when a branch was formed in South Boston, and as far as able she continues to hold her interest in the work of the organization. She was the first ])resi(lent of the Primary Teachers' Association of Bos- ton, and has been for eight years president of the Lady Teachers' Association of South Bos- ton. This association was formed in LS74, it being the only one where relief in case of sickness is made prominent. She is a member of the Denison and Boston Teachers' Club, president of the Mattapannock Club, corre- sponding secretary of Hawes Church Women's Alliance, and historian for the Dorchester Heights Chapter, I). R. She is a good presid- ing officer. She writes with ease and fluency, and has given many lectures.

Miss Newell has always been very patriotic and devoted to the interests of her country. At the breaking out of the Civil War, while waiting for an opportunity to enter the public schools, she gave her time to her country, and was one of the first to enter Liberty Hall, in Boston, when busy fiands made light work of much that was needed in those days. Again, years after, during the Spanish-American War, when organizations were formed for a,ssisting the soldiers, she gave the greater part of her vacation to the cause, although greatly in need of a change from her long, continuous lal)or of teacliing.
