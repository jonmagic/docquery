At a moot court, convened in Boston a few years ago, for the trial of the cam^e celebrc, Sir Francis Bacon vs. William Shakespeare, Mrs. Williams, after repeatedly declining, consented to espouse the Baconian siile, and, as the junior l)arrister, opened the case in a most eloc[uent and finished manner. So lawyer-like were her arguments that she was highly praised by the late Judge Nathaniel Holmes (formerly Dean of the Harvard Law School, and ex- Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Missouri), the late Professor Smith, of the Dorchester Latin School, and even by the noted Shakespearean com- mentator, Dr. Rolfe. And yet Mrs. Williams is not a Baconian. Personally she is rather retir- ing, and the bulk of her work has been tione in a quiet way. She is a member of the New England Woman's Press Association.

whose immigrant ancestor, Robert' Stark- weather, was at Roxbury in 1640, and later settled at Ipswich.

The Hon. John Locke (Harv. Coll. 1792) served six years as a member of Congress. He married Hannah" Goodwin, daughter of Na- thaniel Gooilwin, Jr., of Plymouth, and giand- daughter of Nathaniel Goodwin, Sr., and his wife, Lydia' Le Baron (great-great-grand- mother of Mrs. I^pham). Lydia was a daugh- ter of Lazarus Le Baron and grand-daughter of Dr. Francis Le Baron, the "Nameless Noble- man" from France, whose romantic story fur- nished a fruitful theme for the pen of Mrs. Jane G. Austin, and whose grave is to-day heUl sacred in historic Plymouth. It is said that in Mrs. Grace Le Baron Upham are evi- denced the manners and looks of her distin- guished French progenitor.

To the "Mayflower" and Plymouth Rock Mrs. Upham traces back through three Bart- lett generations, thus: The wife of Lazarus Le Baron and mother of his daughter Lydia, above named, was Lydia' Bartlett, daughter of Jo- seph'' Bartlett (Joseph.^ Robert'). Robert' Bartlett, who came in the "-Ann" in 1623, married Mary Warren, daughter of Richard' Warren, one of the signers of the Compact in November, 1620.

Mrs. Jane E. Locke, singularly sweet and gracious in character, had a fine mind. She was a writer for the magazines and periodicals of the day, and published several volumes of poems. She was a contemporary anil friend of William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel P. Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. In the years directly preceding her death, which occurreil in 1859, Grace was her constant companion, and was privileged to meet such well-known literary folk as Poe, Lydia Maria Child, Fanny Fern, Mrs. Sigourney, not to mention other authors of lesser note in their day.
