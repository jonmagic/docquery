SARAH JOSEPHA HALE, author and ])hilanthropist, was born October 24, 17.SS, in Newport, N.H. She was a daughter of Captain Gordon ami Martha (Whittlesey) Buell and grand-daughter of Nathan and Tliankful (Grifhn) Buell and of Joseph and Sarah (Whittlesey) Whittlesley, all descendants of New England Pui'itans, early settlers of Coimecticut.

Ca|)tain Gordon Bu(&gt;ll served as an officer in the Revolution, and after the war he settled in Newport, N.H.

When only sixteen years old, Sarah J. Buell began teaching school, which jjrofession she followed for nine years. In 1813 she married David Hale, a lawyer, of Newport, and in 1822 by his death she was left a wiilow with five children.

Mrs. Hale had already Ijecome a worker with her pen, contributing to various newspapers and other periodicals. In 1823 she publisheil a collection of her verses, entitletl "The Genius of Oblivion, and Other Poems." Her first novel, "Northwood," was issued in Boston in 1827, under the title of "The Book of Flowers."

In 1828 Mrs. Hale n^moved from her home among the hills to Boston, to take the position of etlitor of the Ladies' Magazine, the first pub- lication of its kind for women in America.

"I was mainly educated by my mother and strictly taught to make the Bible the guide of my life. The books to which I had access were few, very few in comparison to the number given children nowadays; but they were such as required to be studied, and I did study them. Next to the Bible and the 'Pilgrim's Progress' my earliest reading was Milton, Ad- dison, Pope, Johnson, Cowper, Burns, and a portion of Shakespeare. I did not obtain ail his works until I was nearly fifteen. The first regular novel I read was 'The Mysteries of lUlolpho,' when I was ([uite a child. I name it on account of the inHuenco it exerted over my mind.
