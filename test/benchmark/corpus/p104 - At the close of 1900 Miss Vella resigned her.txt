At the close of 1900 Miss Vella resigned her position as State Primary Secretary of Massa- chusetts, and soon after she was married to Mr. Charles F. Borden, a merchant of Fall River. Mr. Borden is a member of the State Board of the Young Men's Christian A.ssocia- tion and president of the Fall River District for Sunday-school work.

Since her marriage Mrs. Borden has lost none of her interest in the forward movements of the Sunday-school cause. Amid the many duties of her home life she finds time to dis- charge with great efficiency the superintend- ency of the Junior Department of the Central Congregational Bible School in Fall River, to serve as a wise and energetic member of the

District Executive Committee, anil as presi- dent of the Fall River Primary and Junior Sunday-school Teachers' Union. The follow- ing extract from resolutions adapted unani- mously by the Executive Committee of the Massachusetts Sunday-school Association show the high appreciation felt for Mrs. Borden and her work. This Executive Committee is com- posed of leading Massachusetts Sunday-school workers, and represents one thousand nine hundred and nineteen Sunday-schools and three hundred and forty-five thousand one hundred and thirty-three Bible students.

" She has organized the primary teachers into associations for mutual and helpful in- tercourse and for the interchange of plans and purposes in department effort, and has, by her lesson studies, her literary work, her song- books — that have effectively touched many young lives — and her spirit of devotion and unselfishness and her exalted Christian char- acter, lifted the Primary Department to a high plane of active and useful living; and she has awakened a new and abiding interest in the general work as represented by the State As- sociation.

" Her influence in the work for the children has not been confined to our own State, but has extended far beyond our borders, reach- ing all parts of our country. The wealth of her resources, her ripe experience, and her sym- pathy have been freely and generously dis- tributed where the most good could be ac- complished. We extend to her our best wishes for the future, and pray that God's choicest blessings may ever attend her and her work."
