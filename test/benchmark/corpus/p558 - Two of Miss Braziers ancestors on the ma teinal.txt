His mother, Anne Devens, wife of Thomas Rand, was "probably daughter of Philip Devens" and nearly related to the family to which Judge Devens belonged.

Another patriotic ancestor, John Hicks, of Cambridge, was slain by the British in the retreat from Lexington, April 19, 1775. The Hon. Charles Saunders, former Mayor of Cam- bridge, first president of the Sons of the Amer- ican Revolution, is also a descendant of John Hicks and second cousin to Miss Brazier.

Marion H. Brazier was born in Charlestown on the day that California was made a State, and was graduated from the Bunker Hill Gra,nmiar School at the close of the Civil War. This completed her schooling, but not her education, which has come through her c^)n- tact with the world, her ambition leading her to associate with her superiors in intellect, to keej) up to date, and never to look back. After Miss Brazier had filled positions of trust as accountant and cashier for a number of years, her health became so seriously impaired as to demand a change " of scene and occupation. She crossed the continent in ISSS, and while in Santa Fe a sudden inspiration came to her to write of the scenes in that picturescjue city. Thus it happened that, in the room where General Lew Wallace had written "lien-Hur," Miss Brazier wrote her first article for pulili- cation. While in California her pen was kept busy in supplying the local and New England papers with breezy specials on many topics. She was for a long time society and club edi- tor of the Boston Sunday Poxt, regular con- tributor to the Boston Transcript, editor of a New York society magazine, and space writer for innumerable news)«ipers. She is a jour- nalist of the widp-awake type, and has been the biographer of many noted people.

Her writing has been largely devoted to pa- triotic matters. The I'nlriotic Review, founded, edited, and published by Miss Brazier, is a fine example of historical literature. It has a good circulation and a host of appreciative readers.

Mi.ss Brazier is at present (1904) society editor of the Boston .Journal and a regular con- tributor to the Sunday Hirald and the Globe. She holds membershi]) in ihv following organ- izations: New England Woman's Press Asso-

ciation; Charity Club; Actors' Church Alliance; Daughters of Veterans; U. S. W. V. Auxiliary; Daughters of New Hampshire and of Massa- chusetts; Woman's Club House Corporation; and in the National Society, D. A. R., in which she has founded two chapters — Bunker Hill and Paul Jones. Thnnigh her efforts the naval hero of the American Revolution is honored in Ma.ssachu.setts, and a handsome schoolhouse bears his name in East Boston.
