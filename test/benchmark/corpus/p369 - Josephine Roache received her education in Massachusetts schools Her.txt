Josephine Roache received her education in Massachusetts schools. Her first teaching was in Danversport, whither the family had removed after a few years' sojourn in Salem. Later she taught in Salem, Danvers, and Lynn, being connected over twenty years with the Lynn schools. Since leaving public school work, she has conducted classes in literature and current events in Lynn, Salem, and Dan- vers, and has been a prominent member in the Lynn Women's Club and the Outlook Club. She has also lectured liefore many clubs in New England.

From early childhood her love for good literature has increased year by year. ?Ier influence in guiding the literary taste of the high school pupils who came under her teach- ing was a strong one, the result being that, as college professors have given testimony,

they were more advanced in literature than pupils from similar schools. She had the rare ability of telling pupils just enough to awaken in them the desire to read every author she touciied upon. This ability, she often says, was inheriteil from her mother, who was an excellent raconteur, and who inspired her with a love for the best in the world of books.

Miss Roache is a poet of no mean al)ility, having written verses for many public occa- sions, among them the hynm sung at the lay- ing of the corner-stone of the Lynn High School, and the poem calletl " The Story of the Okl Elm Tree," written for the celebration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the town of Danvers.

Perhaps no better estimate of her character and work can be made than the following, written by a co-worker in the Lynn High School, who has been able to trace her influ- ence in the lives of many that came under her instruction during a ]ieriod of nearly forty years :â€”

" In the summer of 1881 I first became ac- quainted with Miss Josephine Roache. At that time she was an assistant in the Lynn High School; and for ten years thereafter, in one capacity or another, I was associated with her in- the work of that school, and learned to know and value her excellent (lualities as teacher and woman.

"Her special department was English lit- erature: and she certainly was posses.sed fif remarkable power to interest the young people, perhaps more especially girls, in that sub- ject. Her methods evidenced a conviction on her part that the way to teach English lit- erature to ]iui)ils enovigh advanced to be in high school .should by no means be limited to a dissection and critical analysis of the .sentences, or even of the entire composition. One saw at once that it was her higher aim to make the pupils' hearts and souls respond to the author's thought. Her low, soft, well- modulated voice bespoke the perfect self- control; and she .scorned to govern her cla.s.ses by means inconsistent with a self-respecting and dignified womanly character.
