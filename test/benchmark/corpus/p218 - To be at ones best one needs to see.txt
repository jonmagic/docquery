"To be at one's best, one needs to see each duty in its relation to the whole problem of life. For a person to become religious docs not mean any vmdue withdrawal of time and strength from any lines of laudable activity previously enjoyed. Some such withdrawal often conduces to desirable variety and there- fore to efficiency. These considerations have a special application to the vexed questions concerning woman's sphere."

Naturally, a woman of so great executive ability has been sought for as one of the leaders among women. Mrs. Boyden is one of the Board of Management of the Home for In- temperate Women, president of the Woman's Publishing Company, and treasurer of the Suffolk Coimty Branch of the King's Daugh- ters and Sons. Her chief work, however, is as the efficient leader of the Ward and City Committee of the Independent Women ^'oters, of which she is president. This organization has a deep interest in the welfare of the public schools. It is thoroughly organized, and is a power at every election. Mrs. Boyden's prov- ince is to arrange for campaigns, instruct the women in the twenty-five wards of Boston, confer with kindred organizations and political parties, and keep an outlook on all that concerns the city schools, always working for theii- best interests. Naturally diffident, it was with ex- treme reluctance that she accepted the position of president of so large an organization, but experience has so enlarged her opportunities for service that now she commands the forces with skill, wisdom, and tact. She has en-

deared herself to the women she leads. Strong in body, cheerful in temperament, cordial in manner, loving in heart, in the prime of life, she wields a potent influence in helping many of her sisters to a higher life and into broader paths of usefulness.
