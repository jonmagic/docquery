MARY GRAY DEANE, Past National Insjiector of the Woman's Relief Corps, is the wife of Major John M. Deane, of Fall River, Mass. She was born in Norwich, Conn., November 16, 1S46, and is a daughter of the late Abner T. Pearce, a contractor, who built the first rail- road in South America. During the Civil War she was a school-girl in Providence, R.I., and her Ieis\u'e hom'S were spent in scraping lint and in other work for the Union soldiers. In

1865 her parents moved to Freetown, Mass., and a year later her marriage took place.

Mrs. Deane has been identified with relig- ious and charitable work in Fall River for more than thirty years, having served on ac- tive committees of the First Congregational Church, of which she has been a meml)er since 186.S. Dm'ing the teni[)erance revival in Fall River several years ago Mrs. Deane was a member of the I'^xecutive Board of the AVoman's Christian Temperance Union, and, as treasurer of the "Coffee House" which was establisheil anil conducted on a large stale by the Union, she rendered valuable aid.

She has taken an interest in the Woman's Auxiliary to the Young Men's Christian As- sociation, and for more than twenty years was one of the Board of Managers of the Children's Home at Fall River. A large brick building was dedicated in 1895, in which many desti- tute orphans receive the comforts of home life. Mrs. Deane co-operated in the efforts for the erection of this building. She is a regular visitor to the home, and is especially interested in the welfare of the children. She is a meniljer of Miimehaha Lodg(% Daughters of Rebekah, of Fall River.

For the past thirteen years she has devoted her energies largely to work for the Grand Army of the Rep\i!ilic. Through the efforts of Major Deane, a Relief Corps was organized in 1888 as an auxiliary to Richard Borden Post, No. 46, with Mrs. Deane as a charter member. She was chosen its President, and was r(&gt;-elected three years in succession. Dur- ing the nearly four years of her service as President, Mrs. Deane met with success in her efforts to make the corps one of the best in the State. Upon retiring from the chair she accepted the office of Treasurer, a position she has held continuously, with the exception of one year when other official duties pre- vented. She was a member of the Executive Committee of Arrangements for the National (■Convention held in Boston in 1890, and has participated in nearly all the subsequent Na- tional Conventions.
