Going abroad in 1902, where she witnessed the coronation ceremonies of King Edward VII., she studied along such lines as would fit her for writing upon and teaching dramatic subjects.

sisters, she being the youngest of the family of five. She learned something of business methods by serving as book-keeper for her brother Stephen, a majiufacturer. Adopting at an early age the profession of teacher, she taught school for several years in North Oxford, and then attended the Clinton Liberal Institute in Central New York, where she studied the higher branches of learning. On leaving the Institute she went with some friends to New Jersey. In that State there were then no public schools worthy the name.

At Bordentown she obtained permission of the local authorities to open a free school. The school began with six boys, others came in, and soon her room was filled. Before long the borough built a .school-house costing four thousand dollars, and a little later the free public school of Bordentown, with Miss Barton at its head, had six hundred pupils and eight teachers. On account of failing health she at length resigned her position as teacher and went to Washington to recuperate. A few months later she became a clerk in the Patent Office. This was in 1854. Losing her ])Osition when Buchanan was President, she regained it after the election of Lincoln.
