Mr. and Mrs. Southwick have three children, namely: Ruth, born September 18, 1893; Mil- dred, born August 15, 1895; and Jessie, born November 18, 1897 â€” all of whom are now re- ceiving the best educational advantages that can be secured.

HANNAH E. AND JULIA R. OILMAN, the principals of the Home and Day School for Girls at 324 Conunon- wealth Avenue, Boston, belong to a family which for many generations has mani- fested a marked interest in all matters pertain- ing to Christian education. Their genealog- ical tree shows New England stock of the best quality. In one branch appears the name of Daniel C. Oilman, the first President of Johns Hopkins Lhii versify and now at the head of the Carnegie Institution, \A'ashiiigton, D.C. In anothei- branch is found the name of Arthur Oilman, of Cambridge, formerly regent of Rad- cliffe College.

The Rev. Tristram Oilman (Harv. Coll. 1757) gi'eat-grandfather of the Misses Oilman of Boston, was the honored and beloved pastor of the First Church in North Yarmouth, Me., for forty vears, or from the date of his ortlina- tion in 1769 until his death in 1809. Their grandfather, .Iosei)h Oilman, who was an emi- nent physician in Wells, Me., was a stanch ad- vocate of education, good citizenship, and every form of philanthropy. A more distant for- bear, the Rev. Nicholas Oilman, A.M. (Harv.

The men were more ambitious to be useful members of society than to acquire either fame or fortune, and they were distin- guished for their quiet home virtues.

The subjects of this sketch were born in Fox- croft, Me., being the daughters of EbenezoT and Roxana (Palmer) Gilman. The parents had high ideals for their children, eight in all, and together they trained the boys and girls in habits of industry, thrift, self-control, and a genuine religious faith. The father was a man of unusual sweetness and purity of char- acter. The mother, like so many New Eng- land women of that period, had a practical wistlom and energv which beautifully com- plemented her husbaml's gentle traits. Both believed in the value of a good education, for daughters equally with sons, and labored cheer- full)' to secure for their large family such ad- vantages as the times afforded.

The elder of these two sisters, Hannah, studied first at the Foxcroft Academy and late]- at Bradford Seminary, being graduated in 1857. From this time onward she devoted herself assiduously to study, not for the sake of mere accomplishment or mental exercise, but with an earnest purpose to embody in her life the spirit expressed in Whittier's lines,

" Make the world within your reach Somewhat the better for your living, And gladder for your human speech."

Her love of culture was inborn, and the whole- some discipline of Puritan training gave her
