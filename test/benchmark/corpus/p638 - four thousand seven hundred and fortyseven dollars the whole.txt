four thousand, seven hundred and forty-seven dollars, the whole practically distributed to producers.

The Educational Department has charge of the Perkins Lecture Course, where each year varied and valuable lectures are given free to L^nion members, and of other methods of in- struction calculated to stimulate intelligent thought and a high standard of work; and each year it adopts such industrial class work as shall best "help women to help them- selves."

The ethical side of the Union work has fairly kept pace with the other departments. The Committee on ]']thics has during the past two years aroused an interest which has resulted in an Association for Promoting the Interests of the Adult Blind in Massachusetts.

In the Employment Department is conducted the work of the Domestic Reform League, whose object is to emphasize the business relation of employer and employee, and to promote by careful investigation a better knowl- edge of present conditions and to suggest possible readjustments.

The Business Agency receives applications for all employments other than domestic ser- vice — as book-keepers, stenographers, nurses, attendants, governesses, etc.

The Protective Committee investigates claims for wages unjustly withheld from women, and gives much needed counsel and advice on legal matters. The Befriending Committee gives friendly advice, sympathy, and aid to all women who come to th(&gt;m in perplexity or need. The province of the Social Extension Committee is to provide facilities for the comfort and con- venience of I'nion members and to express the genuine, democratic Ihiion spirit of fellowship and good-will. And thus an ever-lengthening vista of opportunity for service lies open before the Boston Women's Educational and Industrial Union.

The present officers (1904) are: President, Mrs. Mary Morton Kehew; Secretary, Miss H. I. Goodrich; Trea.surer, Mrs. Helen Peirce; with four \'ice-Presidents and twelve Direc- tors. There is a membership of twenty-five hundred.
