The American Association of the Red Cross, it should be mentio^ied, was legally incorporated in the District of- Columbia. A broader scope was given to its humane work by the adoption by the ratifying congress at Berne of the '"American amendment,' whereby the suffering incident to great floods, famines, epidemics, conflagrations, cyclones, or other disasters of national magnitude, may be ameliorated by the administering of necessary relief."

On April 17, 1893, was incorporated in the District of Columbia, to continue the work of the American Association above named, "The American National Red Cross," to constitute the Central National Committee of the United States, authorized by the In- ternational Committee of Geneva. The American National Red Cross was reincor- porated by Congress in 1900. Miss Barton

held the office of President till her retirement in the spring of the present year (1904), when she was succeeded by Mrs. John A. Logan.

From the beginning the American Red Cross, so long under the efficient leadership of Clara Barton, has been in active relief work in times of national woe and calamity, finding its duties in such occasions as (to mention but a few) the forest fires of Michigan in 1881; the Ohio and Mississippi floods of 1884; the Johnstown disaster, 1889: the Rus- sian famine, 1891-92; the South Carolina tidal wave, 1893; Armenian massacres, 1896; anil later among the "reconcentrados" of Cuba and in field and camj) and hospitals during the Spanish-American War. The story of these activities would fill volumes.

Referring to the work in Cuba, the Hon. Retlfield Proctor, in a speech in the United States Senate, March 17, 1898, said: "Miss Barton antl her work need no endorsement from me. I liad kjiown and esteemed her for many years, but had not half appreciated her capability and devotion to her work. I especially looked into her business methods, fearing there would be the greatest danger of mistake, that there might be want of system, waste, and extravagance, but found she could teach me on these points. In short, I saw nothing to criticise, but everything to com- mend."

The following extract from the official report of Lieutenant Colonel B. F. Pope, Chief Surgeon, Fifth Army Corps, battles of San Juan, El Caney, Santiago de Cuba, is additional testimony to the invaluable aid rendered by this distinguished woman: " In Major Wood's hospital over one thousand wounded men were received within three days; and, in spite of lack of shelter and the subsequent exposure to intense heat and drenching rains, the mortality rate was less than seven per cent. . . . Early after the battle the hospital was honored by the presence of Miss Clara Barton and her staff of four assistants, who immediately set up their tents and cooking apparatus, and labored incessantly, day and night, in the broiling sun and drenching rain, preparing sick food for the wountled and serving it to them, and

in a thousand other ways giving the help that the Red Cross Society brings."
