work and ministration of conifort to those in distress that I will speak. While Mrs. Robin- son has found time to perform an enormous amount of work of a pul)lip nr semi-public nature, she has qlso pinched out an hour or day from such work to visit the unknown sick, to collect and disburse comforts antl delicacies to those in distress, and to give a guiding liand in the affairs of families helpless because of in- efficiency or shiftlessness. One or two specific cases described is better than a column of gen- eralities. One family to which she was called consisted of a husband, wife, and eight small children. Husband a drinking man, wife a drinking woman, who had led a life of de- bauchery and was in the last stages of consump- tion. Home barren of furniture and even of the commonest utensils of a kitchen outfit. To this miserable home Mrs. Robinson went out one night and nvu'sed the sick woman for .several days, until the jwor unfortunate passed on to the great majority. Few women occupying Mrs. Robinson's sphere in life would have deigned to leave their own comfortable homes and become a nurse in a stranger's house, and still fewer the number who would venture into a household of squalor and vermin to perform the noble service."

Mrs. Robinson is a member of the Benevolent Committee of the First Universalist Church of Worcester, and is one of the leading workers of the church. The Rev. Almon Gunnison, D.D., President of St. Lawrence University, Canton, N.Y., a former pastor, thus speaks of her: —

"Mrs. Robinson has been for many years prominently associated with the First Univer- salist Church of Worcester, Mass. She has held the position of president of the Ladies' Social Circle, one of the largest and oldest organiza- tions of the church. The position called for many and varied duties, all of which she dis- charged with marked ability. Possessing great dignity of manner, she presided over the meet- ings of the organization with grace and force, fulfilling the manifold executive functions of the place with great skill and tact. A forceful and graceful speaker, she was conciliatory in manner, and had great energy in pushing to completion her various plans. !\Irs. Robinson has never permitted her public work to inter-

fere with or mar her administiation of her home. Her husband and children mingle admi- ration with their affection, for she has ever been .solicitous in looking after their welfare. Tlie home has been the place to which the childnni have ever returned with pleasure, and the wife and mother has omitted no duty. One of lier daughters is a student at St. Lawrence Uni- versity."

Of her experience in relief work, Mrs. Robin- son says: "I have taken pleasure in giving my time, means, and efforts to this work. It is a great education in many ways, and has assisted me in a knowledge of how to bring up my chil- dren, which, for all this outside work, I have done, having n(&gt;ver in any way neglectetl their education or good health. I believe a mother should mingle with the world and take an in- terest in matters outside the home, in order to be capal:)le of teaching her children as they should be taught. A mother is — or should he — a teacher through her entire life to her children."
