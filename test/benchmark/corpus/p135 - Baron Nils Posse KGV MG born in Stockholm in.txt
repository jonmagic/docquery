Baron Nils Posse, K.G.V., M.G., born in Stockholm in 1862, came of a noble Swedish family whose history dates l^ack fully one thousand years. His father was Baron Knut Henrik Posse, K.S., Governor of the Artillery

and Engineering School of the Swedish army and Major of the First Field Artillery. His mother was Lady Sophia Lilliestrole, of an- cient Swedish nobility. In 1880 he was grad- uated from a Swedish college with a degree equiv- alent to Bachelor of Science in America, and fourteen months later was graduated with high honors from the Military Academy. Brevetted by the King as a Lieutenant in the Life Grena- diers in 1881, he was transferred to the Field Artillery with the same rank in 1883. While in the army he took his first yearly course at the Royal Gynmastic Central Institute, com- pleting his training at the expiration of his military service, and receiving his diploma in 1885. In 1884 he was assistant in the Medico- Gymnastic Department of the Institute, also an instructor in the Stockholm Gymnastic and Fencing Club; and from 1881 to 1885 he was an active member in the Stockholm Gymnastic Association, the leading organization of its kind in that country. Before he left Sweden he was an instructor in the army as well as in the public schools.

Coming to America in 1885, he settled per- manently in Boston, and for three years prac- tised medical gymnastics exclusively. The out- growth of a normal class in Swedish gymnastics, of which he was asked to take charge in 1886, is the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics, for whose estal^lishment he was largely indebted to the assistance of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, the well-known philanthropist. Of this school the Baron was director until January 1, 1890.

In February, 1890, he opened a gymnasium of his own in the Harcourt Building, on Irving- ton Street. This was the small beginning of the Posse Gynmasium, which at the time of the founder's death had over five hundred pupils, and, with its three departments, peda- gogical, educational, and medico-gymnastic, its complete apparatus and appointments, adapted to Swedish and other forms of gym- nastics, anthropometric e.xercises, fencing, danc- ing, anil so forth, and its comprehensive cur- riculum, has come to be recognized as one of the finest in the country. His useful activities, however, were not confined to the gymnasium. He not only found time to make translations from famous Swedish authors on gymnastics

and kindred subjects and contribute articles to papers and magazines, but wrote several valuable text-books on physical education, among these being " Special Kinesiology of Educational Gynmastics," "Handbook of School Gymnastics," "The Scientific Aspect of Swedish Gymnastics," "Columl)ian Essays on Swedish Gymnastics," "Medical Gymnastics."

The Journal of Education, in a notice of one of his books, spoke of Baron Posse as having come to this country bringing the gospel of the Ling system of educational gynmastics, and said, " We do not recall any man of any land who has taken sucli a hold of the teachers and friends of education in Boston as has Baron Nils Posse. Through his judicious, un- ostentatious introduction of physical culture, that subject has been advanced as far in a few months as manual training, for instance, in as many years."
