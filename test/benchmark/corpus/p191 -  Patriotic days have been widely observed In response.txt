" Patriotic days have been widely observed. In response to the Flag Day letters bearing

the joint message of the (i, A. R. and W. R. ('., flags floated from ocean to ocean. . . .

"Work has rapidly advanced along all lines. Flags, charts, oleographs, have been placed in the schools. Patriotic j)rograms of rare merit have been constantly prepared, and the children of our land have sung 'The Star- spangled Banner' with a new sjiirit and vigor.

" I wish especially to commend the work of the Sons of Veterans. Their organization is one of noble purpose, and the results of their united efforts cannot fail to be a grand success. I woukl also call especial attention to the open- ing of the new educational institution, the Sons of Veterans Memorial University, on Sep- tember 10, at Mason City, la."

Mrs. Jones is honored in her native State, and has filled places of responsibility in other lines of work. She is one of the Trustees and chairman of the Book Conunittee of tlie Brad- ford Public Library, which was started at her suggestion. Its beginning was in 1874, when Mrs. Albert Bailey and Mrs. Jones went about from house to house, and jirocured subscrip- tions of one dollar each from sixty-three women to a fund for the purchase of books for a li- brary. In addition to the annual subscrip- tions, money was obtainetl by entertainments and lectures conducted by the association. The books were kept at the house of Mrs. Jones, who acted as librarian three years. At the dedication of the present building, the gift of John Lunn Woods, in 1895, the address was delivered by the Hon. J. H. Benton, Jr., of Boston, a former resident of Bradford. Re- ferring to the work of the Ladies" I^ibrary As- sociation, he said: "Who can measure the good which has resulted to this comnumity from this patient, persistent, un.selfish work of these wise and public-spirited women? They de- serve our jM-aise equally with him whose name this buiUling bears. While his name is car- ried upon the portals of your library, theirs should be borne upon tablets upon its walls, that in the years and generations to come those who enjoy the benefits may not forget how nuich they owe to those who made its existence possilile."

Mrs. Jones is a prominent member of the Daughters of American Revolution in \'ermont,

Charles Jones, the date of whose birth is recorded above, was engaged for many years in the insurance Inisiness in Bradford, in part- nership with Colonel John C. Stearns. The firm became one of the best known in that sec- tion of Vermont. Mr. Jones held various po- sitions of trust in Bradford, serving as presi- dent of the Village Corporation, ^^'ater Com- missioner, School Trustee, and director and treasurer of the Bradford P^lectric Lighting Company. He died in A\n-\\, 1901. The local paper of Bradford, in the issue of April 19, paid the following tribute to his memory; " One of the saddest duties of our twenty years' newspaper experience is to chronicle the death of Charles Jones, to us a personal bereavement, anfl shared by a large number of our citizens outside his immediate family. His worth was best known to those with whom he was long- est and most intimately a.ssociated and who were brought into closest contact with him. He was upright and honorable, capable in all the positions of i)ublic and private affairs which he administered."
