His uniform courtesy, dignity, and friendliness won the affection of all, and made him always a welcome companion."

A former pastor of the church in Keene wrote to her : " You have the comfort of reflecting that you have been a true helpmeet to your husband these many years. By your energy, your sympathy, your judgment, your ready ])lanning for the social interests of a ])arish, as well as for the advancement of the church and Sunday-school, you have shown a spirit of co-operation that must have been invaluable to him."

Mr. Hayward, who had been identified with the Masons, the Temple of Honor, and United Order of the Golden Cross, was an officer of Beaver Brook Lodge of Odd Fellows at Keene, N.H. He had four brothers, two of whom are living in New Hampshire.
