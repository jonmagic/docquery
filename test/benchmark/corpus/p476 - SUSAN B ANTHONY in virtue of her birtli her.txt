SUSAN B. ANTHONY, in virtue of her birtli, her parentage, her six years of budding childhood |)assed nt the foot of "Old Greylock" in the Berkshire range of hills, also through the residence of her an- cestors in direct line, both maternal and pater- nal, with most if not all of their kith and kin, for seven generations, in Rhode Island or South- eastern or Western Massachusetts, may be justly claimed as a New England woman.

Daughter of Daniel and Lucy (Read) An- thony, she was born at Adams, Mass., Febru- ary 15, 1820, and was named for an aunt, Susan Anthony Brownell. Th(&gt; history of the family in America l)egins with the arrival at Portsmouth, R.I., in 1634, of John Anthony, a native of Hempstead, England, and then twenty-seven years of age. He served the colony as a Deputy, 1666-72. He had three sons — John, Jr., Joseph, and Aljraham — and two daughters.

John, Jr., was the father of Albro' Anthony, whose daughter ]&lt;]lizabeth,'' born in 1728,

married a Scotsman, Gilbert Stuart, Sr., and became the mother of Gilbert Stuart, born in 1755, the great portrait painter.

From John Anthony, the immigrant, to Daniel Anthony, of Adams, Mass., the line appears (from the printed records consulted) to have descended through Abraham," William,' William, Jr.,' Daviil,^ Humphrey." William Anthony, son of Abraham and his wife, Alice Woodell, or Wodell, marrietl in 1695 Mary Coggeshall, who belonged to a family well known in Portsmouth, R.I., to this day.

David Anthony married Judith Hicks. Shortly before the Revolution he removed from Dartmouth, Mass., where his son Hum- phrey was born in 1770, to Berkshire, settling near Adams. Judith Hicks probably belonged to the family founded by Roljert Hicks, who came over in the "Fortune" in 1621.

Humphrey Anthony married Hannah Lap- ham. Both were birthright Quakers, or Friends, and she was an Elder, and in " meet- ing" sat on the "high seat." Their son Daniel was born in 1794. At the time of the division in 1826 between the liberal and the orthodox Friends, he sided with the liberals, or Ilicksites. He was educated at Nine Partners, a Friends' boarding-school, and began active life as a teacher, shortly becoming a cotton manufact- urer, some years later a farm-owner, and then engaging in the insurance business, the family home being successively in Adams, Mass., Bat- tenville. Centre Falls, and Rochester, N.Y. Mr. Anthony was a man of excellent business capacity, true moral courage, and sterling in- tegrity; his wife, Lucy Read Anthony, a woman of sweet dis))osition and gentle manners, yet not lacking native energy and force of character. Her father, Daniel Reatl, was a native of Re- hoboth, Ma.ss., a Ilniversalist in religion, a Whig in politics. Her mother, Susanna Rich- ardson Read, was from Scituate.

The removal of Daniel Anthony and his family from Adams to Battenville, N.Y., forty- four miles distant, took place in 1826. Young as she was at this time, Susan had already, from her close association with "Old Graylock" — visible embodiment of strength and uplift, its top seeming to touch the sky — received an inspiration destined to remain with her through
