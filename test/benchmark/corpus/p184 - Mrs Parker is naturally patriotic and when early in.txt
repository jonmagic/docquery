Mrs. Parker is naturally patriotic; and when, early in 1873, a Grand Army Sewing Society was formed, to' assist Post No. 13, of Brockton, she joined its membership roll and was chosen secretary. Elected its first President when the society became a branch of the Department of Massachusetts Woman's Relief Corps in October, 1879, she was subsequently re-elected for three successive years.

The corps, which is one of the largest and most efficient in the State, is auxiliary to Fletcher Webster Post, No. 13, G. A. R., and is No. 7 on the roster of the Department W. R. C. The members appreciate Mrs. Parker's long-continued and faithful service in the cause.

At the annual State convention in Boston in 1880 " the various corps presidents gave good accounts of their corps, that of Mrs. S. Agnes Parker, of Fletcher Webster Corps, of Brockton, being specially interesting."

Mrs. Parker served on important committees

that year, and at the convention in 1881 was elected Department Treasurer. She was De- partment Inspector in 1882, and also served as a member of the Committee on Ritual, Rules, and Regulations. The following year she was appointed chairman of this committee, and was elected to the office of Department Junior ^'ice-President. In 1884 she was chosen Department Senior \'ice-President, and in 1885 re-elected. She presided over the annual convention in Boston in 1886, the Department President, Mrs. Goodale, being detained at home by illne.ss. This cf)nvention elected Mrs. Parker President for the ensuing year, and at its close she presented a report, in which the following summary of the work under her charge is given: â€”

" I have been on duty at headejuarters every week but two. I have issued seven general orders. In my first and seconil general orders I appointed a staff of aides to assist the depart- ment officers in their work and be of service to those corps in remote parts of the State where they needed assistance or instruction. . . .

" My duties as Department President have occupied the greater part of my time. I have travelled in official capacity in the State of Massachusetts four thousand and seventy-one miles, have made forty-one visits to corps, and have been cordially received by the mem- bers. I attended the National Convention at San Francisco, receiving many courtesies on this trip from Department Commander John D. Billings and other officials of the Grand Army of the Republic. I have accepted many invi- tations to anniversaries and inspections, have instituted one corps, installed the officers of six corps, and have paid other official visits too numerous to mention.

" We have expended in relief the past year three thousand nine hundred and three dollars and forty-seven cents. This sum does not in- clude the entire amount contributed, as nnich has been given in the way of clothing and other articles. The Soliliers' Home has received six hundred and fifty-.seven dollars and twenty- eight cents."
