MARIE DEWING FAELTEN, one of the foremost of the young piano teachers of Boston, was born in .San Francisco, Cal., April 26, 1869, being the eldest child of the Rev. Charles Shum- way and Louie E. (Collins) Dewing. Her father was born in Pennsylvania, his parents, Ed- ward and Susan Dewing, having removed to that State from their old home in Salisbury, Conn. The Rev. Charles S. Dewing was for a number of years a teacher of Hebrew anil Greek in Princeton College, of which he was a gratiuate. Later he became a Presbyterian minister, and preached in the West. He came to Massachusetts in 1&lt;S,S6. He established a church in Sonierville, which became self-sus- taining before he left to accept the broader duties of minister at large. Afterward he established churches in Brookline, Brockton, Hyde Park, Haverhill, Waltham, and Spring- field. Mrs. Dewing, who survives her hus- band, is now living in Boston. She was born in Washington, D.C. Her parents were James and Catherine (Osborn) Hoagland, natives of New Jersey and descendants of early settlers. Mr. Hoagland lost his life while on duty in the United States war-ship "San Jacinto" in Chi- nese waters some time in the fifties of last cen- tury. Mrs. Hoagland afterward married C. E Collins, of California, and her little daughter, legally adopted by him, became Louie E. Col- lins. Colonel James Osborn, the father of Catherine (Mrs. Hoagland), and his brother. Colonel Abraham, native-born residents of the old Osborn homestead near Manasquan, Monmouth County, N.J., were officers of the American army in the War of 1812, serving with honor. Their father, Samuel Osborn, fought in the Revolution. He was taken pris- oner, but made his escape, with a neighbor named Allen. His farm was seven times raideil by the Briti.sh.

The earliest bearer of this surname in New England was probably Thomas Osborn, who in 1635 was at Hingliam, Mass., whence he removed to Connecticut. In 1649-50 he was

one of the founders of East Hampton, L.I. His sons Joseph ami Jeremy settled in Eliza- beth, N.J.

A similar name is that of William Fitz Os- bern, that is, William son of Osbern (spelled with an e), who went to England in 1066 with William the Conqueror and after the battle of Hastings was made Earl of Hereford.

At the age of eight years Marie Dewing began her musical education under Miss A. L. Benson in Binghamton, N.Y., and later continued her studies at Tuscarora Academy in Peimsyl- vania. After the removal of her parents to Boston in 1886, she entered the New England Conservatory of Music, taking up her studies under Mr. Carl Faelten, and graduating in 1890, while he was director of the Conserva- tory. In the fall of the same year she became one of the teachers in pianoforte and hand culture and superintendent of the normal de- partment. During this period she introduced the fundamental training course in the chil- dren's classes and established a children's matinee. Weekly lectures upon pedagogi- cal subjects to teachers in the normal depart- ment also became a regular feature through her efforts. In the meantime she was organ- ist at her father's church in Sonierville, taking charge of musical affairs and giving her hearty support to all church work.
