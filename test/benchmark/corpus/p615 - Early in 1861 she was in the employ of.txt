Early in 1861 she was in the employ of the New England Glass Company at East Cam- bridge as translator of the Spanish language.

Miss Bradley was thoroughly j^atriotic, and after the first battle of Bull Run she offered her services to the government as an army nurse. She began her labors in September in a hospital near Alexandria, Va., antl was soon appointed matron of the Seventeenth Brigatle Hospital. In the spring of 1862 she responded to a call from the Relief Department of the United States Sanitary ConnnLssion, and went with Miss Dix to Fortress Monroe. She was assigned to service on the transport boats, and labored faithfully throughout the Peninsular Campaign.

Later in the year she became special relief agent of the Sanitary Conmiission at the camp near Alexandria, Va. Regarding her work here she wrote in her diary: "I entered upon my duties as .soon as the camp was moved to its present location, on the ITtli of December, 1862. The soldiers were in tents. No bar- racks had been erected. Many I found sick and stretchetl on the almost frozen ground in

midwinter, with only a suit of ragged and fever- soiled clothes and one army blanket, with no nourishment that they could take, or that was suitable for sick men. . . .

" Making out requisition in form, I drew a quantity of woollen shirts, and on Sunday morning at inspection I went with the officer, and foimd in the line of men on that damp and chilling day, on the banks of the Potomac in midwinter, seventy-five with only thin cot- ton shirts. To these I gave warm flannels at once, and ever since the really needy have been supplied. Then I went through the sick tents, and immediately after sought an interview with the commantling officer, told him my plan, and asked for hospital tents. These were at once pitched and flooretl. Stoves were placed in them, and the sick collected and made as comfortable as possible. A squad of men was detailed to assist me, and every facility placed in my power."

In recognition of the value of her services at Camp Convalescent, the ability, faithful- ness, and entire self-devotion with which she performed the work intrusted to her charge. Miss Bratlley was presentetl with a handsome watch and chain, "a gift from soldiers to the soldier's friend."

Miss Bradley received many testimonials of regard, among them the following from Mr. John S. Blatchford, secretary of the Sanitary Commission: "Your impaired health, incurred in the performance of your self-imposeil and most arduous labors for the welfare of our sol- diers, is observed by your friends with solici- tude and regret. The service which you have rendered to the cause of humanity, antl the influence you have exerted, resulting in untold alleviation and comfort to those to whom you have ministered in many ways beyond the ordi- dary experience of women, are such as to secure to you the lasting regartl and love of all who have known you in your work. That work has been characterized by rare judgment, great efficiency, untiring zeal and devotion. It is above praise."
