In the winter of 1898, upon the solicitation of the Froebel Preparatory School and the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Nina K. Darlingtone was prevailed upon to leave her home in Philadelphia and establish her work in Boston, where she now resides.

To the many hundreds of teachers who have studied this system directly from her or through correspondence, she has given much time and patient love, resulting in enduring good. It is customary to hear these students state that

the gaining of the work is a "direct answer to earnest prayer" or "the true education found for the first time after a life's search." Thus this system has gone to all parts of the civilized globe, and has representatives in every State and in all the principal cities of our country.

From the tiniest tots of three or four years, who learn their first lessons in "Kindergarten Music-Building" in the simplest form, to the adult who is still a child in heart, it is the nat- ural system of education and nmsic for all. This teaching has ever dwelt latent in the mother-heart, but remained undiscovered for the world until the present day. But to learn it one nmst be willing to become as a little child, even as such a change is also essential in ortler to enter into the kingdom of heaven.

In 189S an organization was founded in Bo.s- ton which will represent the work for future generations. The membership during the first year numbered over three hundred, including some of the ablest men and women in this country and Europe. Among them may be found judges, musicians, composers, and lead- ing educators, as well as the teachers of the System.

SARAH ANNIE PERKINS was born at Lewiston, Me., October 1, 1842, the daughter of the Rev. Gideon and Mary (Dunham) Perkins. Her father was one of the early ministers of the Free Baptist denomination. To unusual mental grasp antl deep spiritual insight he added ardent convictions that leil him to give valiant .service to the temperance and anti-slavery reforms of his day; anil the thrilling experi- ences of tho.se historic years, together with a most careful Christian training, made a deep impression on the lives of his children.

Sarah received her education in the Lewis- ton schools and in the Maine State Seminary, now Bates College, located in the same town. She entered the seminary at the age of four- teen, was graduated at seventeen, and at once took up the duties of a teacher, having been a.ssigned even thus early in her life to the responsible position of preceptress in the

Limerick (Me.) Academy. Before leaving .school she had become a member of the Lewis- ton Main Street Free Baptist Church, of which her parents aijd three brothers were also members.

The second year after graduation she a.ssumed charge of the Dexter (Me.) High School, but, being honored not long after by a call to return to her Alma Mater, .she accepted it, ami was installed as instructor in F'rench, Latin, and other branches, a position which she filled satisfactorily for .six years. She then resigned to accept a similar one in a private school for girls in Boston. Two years later she entered the Lothrop Publishing House as editor of book manuscripts. In this congenial work an honorable and pleasant career was opening before her, when the death of her eldest brother, in 1873, changed her p'lans for life. At his recjuest she unselfishly relin((uished the task for which she had proved herself to be so well fitted, and, taking his orphan children into her care, for nearly ten years she devoted herself to their nurture and training, at the same time ministering to the needs of her aged parents.
