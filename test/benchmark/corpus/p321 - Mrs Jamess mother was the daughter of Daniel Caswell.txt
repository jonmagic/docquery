life. The poor, whom she has often visited in their homes, have been instructed by her teaching;s and aided by her generous con- tributions. Her mother early encouraged her in this laudable mission of helpfulness to others. During the Civil War she offered her services as an army nurse, but nu^t with disap]K)intment, as she was too young to perform official tluty in the hospitals. Many a soldier, however, was provided with comforts and luxuries through her zealous efforts at home in their behalf. When a Relief Corps auxiliary to William L. Rodman Post, No. 1, G. A. R., was formed in New Bedford, Mrs. James enrolled her name on its charter list. From the date of its institution, Sep- tember 11, 1885, to the present time she has devoted her best efforts to the patriotic and charitable work, of the corps. Installed as its president in January, 18S7, she filled the office so successfully that she was re-elected in 18S8 and 1889, and again in 1891 and in 1901. During the intervening years she served successively as senior vice-president, treasurer, and chaplain, willingly taking any position in which she could advance the in- terests of the corps. Mrs. James has served on committees in many department con- ventions, and has been a delegate to national conventions. She has served as deixartment aide by the appointment of seven deiiartment presiilents, and has also served on the staff of two national Relief Corps presidents. She took the lead in organizing the liristol County Association, an&lt;l was its first chajtlain. She was elected president in October, 1890, and served one year, at the close of which she presented to the Association a beautiful gavel. Mrs. James joined the order of King's Daugh- ters in 1887, working independently for the sailors until 1900, when she joined the Unity Circle, K. D., of New Bedford. In 1890 she was instrumental in forming the Ca})tain Thomas Kempton Chapter of the D. R., of New Bedford. Of this chapter she was ap- pointed the first Regent, and continues in the office, having been annually re-elected.

When the Spanish-American War began, and the \'olunteer Aid Association of Massa- chusetts was formed, Mrs. .lames gave her

efforts to the cause. She worked as secre- tary of a connnittee representing Corps No. 53, and assisted in organizing the New Bedford branch of the Adluntcer Aid Associatidu, which accomplished a grand work. This branch forwarded several hundred dollars' worth of hosjiital su|)plies to the soldiers and sailors, and contributed in aildition three hundred dollars toward fitting out the hosjjital shij), "Bay State." which was sent to Cuba by the A'olunteer Aid Association of Massa- chusetts to convey the sick antl wounded to their homes. Mrs. James acted as advisory connnittee during all this work in New Bedfonl, rec(&gt;iving the respect and regard of the society, whose members often referred to her as " our Mrs. Livermore." When the war ended, and active work was over, the money remaining in the treasury of the New Bedford branch was placed in charge of four trustees, of whom Mrs. James was one. Several barrels of com- fort bags, reading matter, and so forth, have been forwarded by her on behalf of the trustees to Porto Rico, Manila, and to the navy. The wives and children of several soldiers have also been cared for at home.
