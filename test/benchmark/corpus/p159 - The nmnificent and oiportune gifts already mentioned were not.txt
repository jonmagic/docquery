The nmnificent and oi)portune gifts already mentioned were not by any means the measure of Mrs. Flint's generosity to this favored town. It was her helping hand that lightened the burden of the war debt upon the tax-payers, that assisted struggling cluu'ches over hard places, and contributed to keep the roadways of the town in a sui)erior condition. The high school, which the town was not l)y law retpiired to maintain, would have long since ceased to be, had not Mrs. Flint again anil again come to its support. By her will she gave to the town three thousand dollars, the income of which shoukl be applied in caring for and improving the Memorial Hall, and she also made liijcral bequests to the different churches.

The generous thoughts and sympathies of Mrs. Flint were not confined within narrow limits, nor her benefactions restricted to the ' domain and residents of North Reading. In Wakefield, the town of her earlier and later life, she was constantly active in plans and deeds for others' benefit. Every humane, philanthropic, or educational enterijrise in the conuuunity enlisted her interest and concern, and, if her judgment approveil, secured from her a substantial ilonation. She gave to the town for the support of the Beebe Town Li- brary the sum of one thousand dollars, which the trustees set apart as the Flint Memorial Fund, the income only being used for the pur-

chase of books. She manifested her friendship for the public schools, the fire department, and disabled soldiers and their families in .substan- tial ways, contritnited to the improvement of highwa3's and establi.shment of drinkirtg foun- tains, and helped the local religious societies in times of need. She was open to every call of charity and voice of tlistress, but her deepest .sympathies, in her later years, were called forth and centred in the organization and operation of that noble charity, the A^'akefield Home for Aged Women, incorporated in 1895. Her heart and mind and ))urse were in this benefi- cent movement from its beginning. Each year she delighted to give it an added impulse, and, dying, she bestowed upon it in her will an earn- est, practical benediction in the sum of five thousand dollars, she having previously assisted its funds in an ecpial amount. She was made honorary president of the corporation. Many other ladies and gentlemen have, by their labors, coun.sel, gifts, -anti sacrifices, aided to make the Wakefield Home a blessed and highly prized institution of the town.

The last will and testament of Mrs. Flint clearly indicated that the benevolence, religious devotion, and public spirit that had actuated all the years of her widowhood burned brightly to the end of her days, as she bequeathctl over one hundred thousand ilollars to various re- ligious and benevolent organizations. It is worthy of especial mention, as illustrating her fervent patriotism, that in her will she gave to the town of Wakefield in trust, with provisions for its ultimate application towaril the erection of a soldiers' monument, the sum of ten thou- sand dollars, ".such monument to be grand in itself, symmetrical in architecture, beautiful in design and finish, attended with solid ami thorough workmanship, worthy of the brave men to whom we dedicate it."
