REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

desk as diligently as she usetl to do upon the platform. To the end of her life, despite her infirmities, she did more jnihlic speaking than most younger women. Her sweet, motherly face, under its white cap, wa.s dear to the eyes of audiences at sufTrage gatherings, and it was said of her that she looked like "the grandmother of all the good children."

She was an excellent housekeeper, of the old New England type. She dri^d all the herbs, and put up all tlie fruits in their season. She prepared her own dried beef, made her own yeast, her own butter, even her own soap. She always thought the home-made soap was better than any she could buy. She was an accomplished cook, and her family were never better fed than during the occasional interreg- nums between servants.

All the purely womanly instincts were strong in her. Even in her old age her ideas about love were what most peojile would regard as romantic. She was as fond of a love story as any girl of sixteen, provided it were a simple and innocent love story. She was attracted by all children, dirty or clean, pretty or ugly. Her face always beamed at the sight of a baby ; and on countless occasions on boat or train, during her lecture trips, she helped worried and anxious young mothers to care for and cpiiet a crying child. All children loveil her. What she was to her own daughter no words can tell.

A friend writes: â€”

"No one who was privileged to partake of Mrs. Stone's hospitality could fail U) note her kindly concern for every one beneath her roof and for all the ilumb creatures belonging to the household. But few knew jiow far-reach- ing was that spirit of kindliness, how many her motherliness brooded over. Flowers and fruits were sent from her garden, boxes of clothing went ^^'est, North, and South, a host of wonien who came to her in distress were helped to work or tidetl over hard places. She gave freely, and every gift was accompanied by thoughtful care and heart-warmtli. She was never too busy to gladden the hearts of the children who came into her presence by gift of flower or fruit or picture, or by the telling of a story."

She took keen delight in all the beauties of nature. As a child, her favorite reward, when she had done well at i^chool, was to be allowed l)y the teacher to sit on the floor, where she could look up through the window into the shinunering foliage of a grove of wliite birches.

She was \\w most perfectly fearless lunnan being I ever"knew. J have heard her say that in the mobs and manifold clangers of the anti- slavery times she was never conscious of a (juickened heart-beat. In all the emergencies of a long life, in accidents, alarms of fire, of burglars, etc., we never saw her fluttered. "The gentlest and most heroic of women," was her husband's description of her. When, in 1S93, her strength failed, and she found that she was suffering from an illness from which she could not recover, she was perfectly serene and fearless, and made all her preparations to go, as quietly as if she wei'e only going into the next room. As long as she was able to think and plan at all, she thought for others, and planned for their comfort. As she lay in bed, too weak to move, she still tried to save every- bodv steps, to spare the servants, to see that guests should be made comfortable, and that a favorite dish shoukl be prejiared for the niece who had come to nurse her.
