poems to the Ladies' Repository, the Neic York Tribune, and other publications, frecjuently lending her pen to the temperance ci.use. Children came to brighten the home life, wliich was a happy though a busy ami strenuous one, and not exempt from the cares and sorrows of sickmss and bereavement.

In 1S57 Mr. and Mrs. Livermore, with their two daughteis, lemoved to Chicago, where for a number of yeais Mr. Livcimore edited and published a religious paper. Mrs. Livermore, as a co-worker, often duiing his absence on a missionary trip had sole charge of the paper, printing-office, and its concerns. She wrote much for tiie paper on every tojMc except theology, and was also a writer for Eastern papers, their well-kept home, in the meantime, being the centre of far-reaching, generous hos- pitality. Her practical energy made itself felt in philantinopic work, such as the establish- ment of the Home for Aged Women, the Hos- pital for Women and Children in Chicago, and the Home of the Friendless.

When the war of the Rebellion came, with its pressing needs — suffering, hunger, and desti- tution — Mrs. Livermore, having always been at work, was reatly with well-developetl forces, powers keen and alert, for new service. This she rendered as an associate member of the I'nited States Sanitary Commission with her friend, Mrs. Hoge, their headquarters being in Chicago. She organized soldiers' aid societies, planned sanitary fairs, conducted an endless correspomlence, went to the front to distribute supplies, tletailed army nurses. These and many similar deeds of mercy were crowded into those years of strife. Pleading for money to meet the wants of sick, wounded, and dying sol- diers, Mrs. Livermore revealed a gift of elo- tjuence of whose possession she was ignorant, and became an effective puljlic speaker years before she would achiiit the fact.

When the war was ended, she returned to her literary and philanthropic activities in Chicago, using her pen as before to advocate the higher education of women and their entrance into the professions and wider industrial fields, and also urging the repeal of unjust laws, which had hindered their progress.

she took the lead in making arrangements for a woman's suffrage convention in Chicago, which was in 1S6(S; and when the Illinois Women's Suffrage Association was organized she was elected its president. To further pro- mote the interests of the great reform move- ments, suffrage and temperance, she started in .January, 1869, a weekly paper called the Agitator, which she conducted successfully for a year in Chicago. Then it was merged in the Woman's Journal, established in Boston in Jaunary, 1870, by a joint stock company, antl she was made its editor-in-chief. The Liver- more family then returned to Massachusetts, and have since resided in Melrose. For two years Mrs. Livermore edited the Woman's Journal, and then resigned that position and all other work, to devote herself to the lecture field, which has witnessed her severest toil as well as her most signal triumphs. For nearly thirty years she has spoken from platform and pulpit on a variety of topics, religious, reforma- tory, sociological, historical, and ethical, and has lectured in nearly every State of the Union, and also in England and Scotland. In these later years her itinerary extends not far from the home fireside. Still, wherever she speaks, whether as presiding officer of a memorial meeting, where a tender tribute is paid to the gracious memory of a departed leader, or at a biweekly meeting of the Massachusetts Suf- frage Association, of which she is president, or to voice a need of the hour, people crowd to hear, and are moved by the old-time fluent force and earnestness, the vivid expression of her powerful personality, which every good cause is sure to arouse.
