John St. Pierre was born in Boston. After his father's death his widowed mother removed with her little family to a farm, at Blake's Landing, near the Taunton River, in the town of that name. Mr. St. Pierre, as above men- tioned, was married in Boston, and subsequently for a number of years was engaged in business as a clothes dealer in this city. His sixth chiUl, the subject of this sketch, was named for the Empress Josephine (a native, be it remem- bered, of the island of Martinique) at the request

of a French lady, her mother's friend, who gave her a christening robe.

The early education of Josephine St. Pierre, received mostly in the public schools of Salem, Mass., was supplemented later by instruction from private tutors in New York. For a few months she was a pupil in the Franklin School, Boston. While still of school age, she was married to George Lewis Ruffin, who has been described as "one of the handsomest and ablest colored men in Boston."

Mr. Rufiin was born December 16, 1834, in Richmond, Va., of free colored parents, who were eilucated and were possessed of some means. In 1853 the family removed to Bos- ton. He here attended the Chapman Hall School. Some years later he studied law in the office of Jewell &amp; (laston, and in 1869 he was graduated from the Harvard Law School. He servetl as a member of the House in the State Legislature in 1870 and 1871 and as a Councilman of Boston in 1876 and 1877. In November, 1883, he was appointed by Governor Butler Judge of the municipal court of Charles- town, being the first colored man to be apjiointed on the bench north of Mason and Dixon's line. This position he held, "serving with fidelity and eflnciency," until his death on November 19, 1886.

To Mr. and Mrs. Ruffin were born four chil- dren: Hubert St. P., Florida Yates, Stanley, and George L. The death of Judge Ruffin was followed in a few years by that of his eldest son, Hubert St. P., who was a member of the Suffolk bar. Fitted for college at the Boston Latin School, Hubert St. Pierre Ruffin entered Harvard in the class of 1882, and on leaving college studied law with his father. At the Latin School, as testified by one who was in the same class with him, "his keen wit, genial disposition, and chivalric courage made him a favorite with the boys; while his high scholar- ship, displayed distinctly in the beauty and exactitude of his translations from the classics, won for him the admiration and esteem both of his classmates and instructors. Mr. Ruffin was in learning and natural abilities eminently fitted for the profession which he chose. Skil- ful and ready in debate, c[uick in repartee, and eloquent and logical in argument, he meriteil
