This propt'- y they afterward sold. In Sep- tember, 1879, Mr. Hazen, being physically unal:)le to continue farm work, engaged in the provision business in Cambridgeport. His invalitlism continuing and serious financial losses following the removal to Cambridge, Mrs. Hazen opened a dressmaking establish- ment, and, as usual in her undertakings, met with success. Dr. Turner, city physician of Cambridge at this time, had been a ward surgeon in the Columbian Hospital at Wash- ington, and knew Mrs. Hazen's capabilities as a business woman. Through the influence of William H. Eveleth, superintendent of grounds at Harvard College, she was given entire charge of Divinity Hall, library and grounds. This position she held for nine years. She then purchased a spacious and pleasant es- tate on Oxford Street, near the college build- ings, in Cambridge, which has been their home for the past fourteen years. She says, " I laiil the foundation of my home by work before day- light and by toiling hours after sundown."

Four children have been born to Mr. ami Mrs. Hazen, and two are now living, namely: Alma M., born May 12, 1868, in North An- dover; and E. Roscoe, born June 5, 1878, in Chelmsford. Alma M. married October 1, 1884, Mr. J. Ernest Conant, of West Somer- ville, and lives in that city. Ernest Willard, born in August, 1872, in Lawrence, died before he was two years old, the result of an accident; and Elbert Titus, born July 6, 1874, in Chelmsford, died May 9, 1881.

Charles Beck Relief Corps, auxiliary to Post No. 56, G. A. R., of Cambridge, was instituted in July, 1879, and by invitation of Conunander Stone of the post Mrs. Hazen joinetl the corps at the next meeting. She has held office therein continuously with the exception of one year. She was elected president, but declined to accept the jjosition. For the past fourteen years she has been Chaplain, being the unanimous choice of the members. Her efficient work is appreciated by Post 56, as well as the corps. She attended the annual convention of the Woman's Relief Corps of Massachusetts at East Boston in 1880, the first State convention held after the formation of the department. She has often partici-

pated in subsecjuent conventions, and has served as Department Aide. In 1886 she journeyed to California with the official party, representing the Departments of Massachu- setts, W. R. C, and in 1893 was a delegate to Indianapolis. She has also attended other National Conventions.

In 1896 the Massachusetts Army Nurse As.sociation was formed at department heiul- quarters, W. R. C, Boylston Building, Boston, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore and other army nurses participating. Mrs. Hazen was electetl Presi- dent, and has been annually re-elected. Its business meetings are held every month at Grand Army headquarters, State House; and public meetings of great interest are occasion- ally held. The Army Nurse Fair, under the management of Mrs. Hazen and her associates, which was held in Boston, November, 1900, netted a liberal sum to their treasury. A grantl relief work is being conductetl by this association, and its reunions are second only in interest to those held by the "boys," to whom they once ministered on battle-fields and in hospitals. A record of army nurses and material of value regarding their services has been collected by the association.
