Mrs. Hawley's mother is a grand-daughter of Captain Abraham Shackleton, of Nottinghanr, England, who was an officer in the Oxford Blues, and fought under Wellington at the battle of Waterloo. An accomplished musician, Mrs. Andros has been organist at St. Peter's ever since her hasband began his directorship, and since his death has filled the dual office of organist and chorister. She is also a teacher of sight reading and harmony, and a successful trainer of men's voices.

Mrs. Hawley's native musical talent was carefully fostered by her parents, she receiving from an early age competent instruction in vocal and instrumental music as well as in harmony. Her general education was obtained in the public schools of Cambridge and at Radcliffe College, which she entered soon after graduating from the English High School. Her literary ability was early displayed in the writing of lyrics, which were soon followed by the words and nmsic of plays. The first work by which she became publicly known was a

musical comedy entitled "The Dove's Supper," which was first given at the Bijou Theatre in 1896. This was afterward enlai'ged and changed to "A Social Escapade," and given at the Tremont Theatre. Some of her most at- tractive songs have been widely sung by some of the best known comic opera stars before the public. "The Potentate," a comic opera of which she wrote the libretto, lyrics, and music, was chosen by the Algonquin Club of Brockton out of fifty submitted to them for production in February, 1903. The piece was given a large and costly production, and received much enthusiastic commendation. The num- ber of comic opera writers has long been so small that for a number of years all the comic 0]ieras produced have been the work of a very few men. Thus enterprising managers hail with delight the advent of this young authoress and composer. Her work is attracting the at- tention of some of the most prominent mana- gers in the country.

Mr. and Mrs. Hawley reside in Winchester.

Mr. Hawley is a choir director of Boston, and himself a fine singer. For a mmiber of years previous to her marriage, which took place in April, 1897, Mrs. Hawley played 'cello in the "Fadettes" (women's orchestra), and she is still a valued member of that organization, though her many duties deter her from often playing with them. She possesses a rich so- prano voice, and is an advanced pui)il of Mme. Gertrude Franklin Salisbury. She has done much church and concert singing, and her voice has both flexibility and compass. She is, without doubt, the only womrm before the public who is both a librettist and a musical composer. With her ambition, talent, and in- dustry, a brilliant future seems to be assured her.
