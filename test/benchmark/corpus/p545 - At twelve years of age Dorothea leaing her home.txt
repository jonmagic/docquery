At twelve years of age Dorothea, lea\'ing her home in A\'orcester, went to live with her

grantlmother. Madam Dix, in Boston. At fourteen she opened a school for little chiklren in Worcester, which she taught in 1816-17. A number of years later she established in the Dix mansion in Boston a boarding and day school, which she continued successfully for five years, but at the cost of her health. In her school-teaching days Miss Dix wrote several books, mostly for children, one of which, "Con- versation on Common Things," reached its sixtieth edition. In the spring of 1836 she broke down completely, and was obliged to give up school-keeping. Going to England for change of scene and rest, she returned to Boston in the autumn of 1837 with her health greatly improved, but found it necessary to go South for the following winter. She had received fiom her grandmother a bequest which, with what she had saved from lier earnings as a teacher, gave her a competency, enabling her henceforth to dispose of her time and follow her tastes as she would.

She chose to be a worker in a n^uch neglected field of philanthropy. Visiting in March, 1841, the jail in East Cambridge, "Miss Dix," says her biographer, " was first brought face to face with the condition of things prevailing in the jails anil almshouses of Massachusetts, which laimched her on her great career."

Note-book in hand, she visitetl jails and alms- houses throughout the State, accumulating statistics of outrage and niLsery, and then addressed a memorial to the Legislature (Janu- ary, 1843), showing the need of reform in the system and appealing for legislative action. She was supported by such men as Dr. Samuel G. Howe, Horace Mann, Charles Sumner, and Dr. Chaiming. The connnittee to which the menmrial was referred made a report strongly indorsing the truth of Miss Dix's statements; and engineered by Dr. Howe, chairman of the connnittee, a "bill for immediate relief was carried by a large majority, and the order passed for providing State acconunodations for two hundred additional insane persons."

"Thus was venture&lt;l and won Miss Dix's first legislative victory, the ])recursor of num- bers to follow throughout the length and breadth of the United States."

from Mr. Cyrus Butler, in answer to a personal appeal from Miss Dix, the sum of fifty thousand dollars, was enlarged and had its name changed to Butler Hospital.

Taking up the cause of the insane in New Jersey, Miss Dix went " from county to county, making personal investigations, jM'eparing a memorial to the Legislature, and moving them to appropriate means for building the Trenton Hospital with its lofty walls and extensive grounds. At the same time she was creating the State Lunatic Asylum at Harrisburg, Pa. Through her efforts the asylum at Utica, N.Y., was doubled in size, and the .4sylum for the Insane at Toronto, Canada, tniilt. From State to State, from county to county, Miss Dix journeyed, seeking out the suffering in jails, almshouses, and wherever they were to be found, who had no other earthly heljier. Hos])itals sprung up at her touch, until she saw structures of her own creation rise in Lidiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mis.'iouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, Washington, and Halifax, N.S.
