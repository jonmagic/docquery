The immigrant Dana was of English birth; but it is believed that there was a strain of French blood in his family, and this may have given to the Danas something of the vivacity and brilliancy which is noted in the work of many authors who have French as well as English blood in their veins. It is certain that, with all those stanch and heroic qualities which have made the Danas eminent for gen- erations, the members of this family have also inherited an intellectual brilliancy which has made them a recognized power in our civic and literary history. It is therefore but a

natural and happy result that the subject of this sketch should have entered upon her life work endowed with those mental qualifi- cations by the cultivation of whicli she has developed into a versatile and charming writer. But she is not indebted to the Danas alone for her inheritance.

Her great-grandfather, Phineas Dana, a descendant of Joseph Dana, the second son of the original Richard, settled in Oxford, Mass. He married Mehitabel AVolcott, of that town, daughter of Josiah^ Wolcott (Henry,' of Windsor, Conn.) and his wife Isabella, daughter of the Rev. John Campbell. This eminent divine, who for forty years was be- loved anil revered as pastor of the church at Oxford, Mass., where many traditions of his scholarship and godly character still remain, was a native of Scotland and â–  a graduate of Edinburgh University. An early ancestor of Miss Dana's on the maternal side was Major Thomas Savage, who came from England to Boston in 1633, ami who was the founder of a family distinguished by integrity, inilustry, great determination, and unusual physical endurance. Of this typical New England stock was James Savage, one of the earliest and most prominent settlers of Augusta, Me. His wife, Eliza Bickford, of Alton, N.H., is still remembered as a woman of devout thought and benignant presence. Sarah W. Savage, the daughter of James and Eliza Bickford Savage, married James Wolcott Dana, and became the mother of Olive E. Dana, who was born in Augusta, December 24, 1859.

With her refined and charming personality, her forceful and sympathetic character, and her remarkalale mental endowments, Miss Dana has exerted a wide infiuence in her large circle of friends and among the many reatlers whom she has never .seen. During the last twenty years, while constantly contributing to the press, Miss Dana has generously given of her time and ability to all good works. She has been interested and active in the church and in the philanthropic and educational move- ments of the day. She was one of the founders of the Current Events Club of Augusta, and was for two years its honored and efficient president. She has also been a member of

Unity Club; and one of her most beautiful poems, "The Laggard Land," was written for a Ixinquet of this old and well-known literary society.

HARRIET W^OOD FOSTER, second daughter of the late David Wood Foster, formerly a well-known and public-spirited citizen of this city, and his wife, Sarah E. Abbott, was born in Boston, as were most of her ancestors for sev- eral generations. On the paternal side she is descended from Hopestill Foster (son of Rich- ard Foster, of Biddenden, County Kent, Eng- land), who arrived at Dorchester, Mass., with his mother, Mrs. Patience Bigg Foster, in 1635. The name of Hopestill Foster appears on the Dorchester records of many years, he serving as Treasurer, Selectman, Deputy to the General Court, and commissioner for small causes.
