As stated in a recent periodical, she is "en- thusiastically loyal to her countrywomen, as she is, indeed, to everything truly American. She believes heartily in woman suffrage, and regrets deeply varicnis fraudulent methods that govern motlern politics." Another subject which has deeply interested her of late is anti- compulsory vaccination, on which she spoke earnestly at the State IIf)use some months ago. Although she was obliged to refuse the nomi- nation for presidency of the society of that name, her heart is entirely in sympathy with the cause.

The Cambridf/e /-"rfs.s of May 13, 190.3, says: "As a writer, Mrs. Hitchcock is especially gifted. Her l)()oks — ' Nancy Hanks, a Story of Abra- ham Lincoln's Mother' and 'The History of the Hanks I'^amily in America' — are regarded as authorities on these subjects. The first clears up what had b(&gt;en for y(&gt;ars before its publica- tion mysterious and unsatisfactory with regard to the biography of tlie most lovable and noble mother of our great President. As a lecturer, Mrs. Hitchcock is fluent and inter- esting as W(&gt;!1 as graceful. Her lectures upon

DOROTHEA LYNDE DIX.— Over a grave in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Massachusetts, the American flag al- ways waves. It is kejjt there by the Army Nurses' Association of Boston and the Grand Army Post, and its presence fittingly commemorates the service which Dorothea Dix rendered her country in the war of the Rebellion.

Miss Dix was born April 4, 1802, during the temporary residence of her parents, Joseph and Mary (Bigelow) Dix, in Hampden, Me. She dieil July 17, 1887, at the State Asylum, Tren- ton, N.J., "one of her hospital homes," where she had tieen tenderly cared for, a loved and revered guest, in her declining years of exhaus- tion and pain.

It has been remarked that Miss Dix seems to have inherited the strong points of her character not from her parents, but from her paternal grandparents. Dr. Elijah Dix and his wife, Dorothy Lynde. " Her father, Joseph Dix, was a visionary man f)f delicate health, and died early. Her mother, after the birth of her second son, fell into invalidism, leaving to the child Doi'othea the care of her two broth- ers, a trust she faithfully fulfilled.

"The grandfather. Dr. Elijah Dix, of whom Miss Dix always cherished pleasant memories, was located many years as a physician at Worcester, where he is remembered to-day as well developed physically and mentally antl in ad- vance of his age in village improvement and educational theories. He was characterized ■for his bravery, honesty, and patriotism. In 1795 he removed to Boston and estalilished a drug store under Faneuil Hall, and founded in South Boston chemical works for the refining of sulplun- and the purifying of canqjlior. He entered largely into the land speculations in the State of Maine, purchased large tracts of forests, out of which he founded the towns of Dixmont and Dixtield." He died in 1809, his widow surviving him twenty-eight years.
