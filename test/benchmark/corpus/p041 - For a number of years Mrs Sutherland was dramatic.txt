For a number of years Mrs. Sutherland was dramatic editor of the Boston Conuno)ncealth, and since her return to active work, in 1896, has contributed to many newspapers, being dramatic critic of the Daily Journal for several years. Most of her time, however, has been occupied with another line of work, that of short story and play writing. One of her first plays presented was given performance at the Hollis Street Theatre in October, 1895, by Charles Frohman's Empire Theatre Company. It was a one-act Southern play, entitled "Mars'r Van," and was written in collaboration with Mrs. Emma Sheritlan Fry. It afterward ran for four weeks at the Empire Theatre, New York, and was also successfully given through- out the West. " Rohan the Silent" was written for Alexander Salvini, and was accepted by him, to be used in connection with "The Fool's Revenge," which it was his intention to in- clude in his repertoire for the season of 1896 and 1897. It was produced by him at a trial

performance at the Tremont Theatre, Boston, May 28, 1896, and it is a notable fact that Rohan was the last role ever created by this actor of great promise. "Fort Frayne," her next attempt, an emotional drama in four acts, was written in collaboration with Mrs. Fry and General Charles King. Its possibilities as a novel appealed to General King, and, with Mrs. Sutherland's consent, he worked the plot into one of his fascinating stories. It met with a large sale, reaching its fifth edition. The play itself, on account of Mrs. Sutherland's illness, was not completed until 1895, and soon afterward was produced in both the East and the West. Its first presentation was in the fall of 1895 at the Schiller Theatre, Chicago, where it had a four weeks' run. In 1897 and 1898 six one-act dramas bj' Mrs. Sutherland were put on the stage, the initial performance of each being in Boston. The first of these, " Po White Trash," was produced by Henrj' Woodruff (for whom the role of Drent Dury was written) at a special matinee at the Bijou Theatre, Boston, and later at the Lyceum Theatre, New York. It was also given in the season of 1898 and 1899 by the Frawley com- pany in the West. The other dramas are "In Far Bohemia," "A Comedie Royal," "A Bit of Instruction," and "At the Barricade." These, with three plays which have not been pro- duced, were published in book form in 1900. They deal with varying phases of life, and some have won marked popularity and favor. In 1900, collaborating with Mr. Booth Tarkington, she helped to dramatize the latter's novel, "Monsieur Beaucaire," which was brought out by Richard Mansfield in October, 1901, and enjoyed long and exceedingly successful seasons in America and I']nglaiid.

Many of Mrs. Sutherland's writings have tlealt with army life, and she has many frieniis in both the army and the navy. She has sjient nuich time "in garrison." At one time when some especially dear friends were stationed at Fort Warren, she had a den fitted up for her- self in one of the old casemates which was used as a prison dming the Civil War.
