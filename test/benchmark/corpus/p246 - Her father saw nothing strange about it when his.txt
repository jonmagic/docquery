Her father saw nothing strange about it when his sons decided to go to college, but, when his daughter wanteil to go, he said to his wife, "Is the child crazy?" He would not help her. The young girl had to earn the money herself. She picked berries and chest- nuts, and sold them to buy hooks. For years she taught district schools, studying and teach- ing alternately. At first she was paid a dollar a week, and "boarded around." She soon be-

came known as a successful teacher, and grad- ually received a higher salary, but could never rise above sixteen dollars per month, which was considered "very good pay for a woman." Once she was engaged to teach a winter school which had been broken up, the big boys throw- ing the master head foremost out of the window into a deep snowdrift. As a rule, women were not thought competent to teach the winter term of school, because then the big boys were released from farm work and were able to at- tend. In a few days she had this difficult school in perfect order, and the big boys who had made the trouble became her most de- voted lieutenants; yet she received only a frac- tion of the salary paid to her unsuccessful pred- ecessor.

She studied for a time at the Monson, Qua- boag, and Wilbraham Academies. Generally, she and her sister Sarah did not board at the academy, but for economy's sake took a room and cooked their own food, bruiging most of their provisions from home.

An old schoolmate recalls the fact that she was already dee])ly interested in the abolition movement, and her compositions were always about slavery. About 1838 Lucy went to Mount Holyoke Seminary. Years before .she had heard Mary Lyon make an appeal for funds for this effort in behalf of higher educa- tion for women. The sewing-circle with which Lucy was connected was at that time working to pay the expenses of a young man prc])aring for the ministry, and Lucy was making a shirt. She was nmch stirred by Mary Lyon's presenta- tion of the need of better educational opportuni- ties for women, and by the thought of how much easier it was for any young man to earn his education than for a young woman to do so at a woman's low pay: and she ceased sewing upon that shirt, and felt in her heart the hope that no one would ever finish it. She spent less than a year at Mount Holyoke, being called home by the death of an older sister; but she always retained an affection for the institu- tion.

Instead of the mite-boxes for foreign missions that were the fashion among the Mount Holyoke students, Lucy kept in her room one of the little yellow collection boxes of the Anti-slavery

Society, which bore the picture of a kneeling slave holding up manacled hands, with the motto, "Am I not a man and a brother?" Into this she put all the pennies she could spare. She also placed William Lloyd Garri- son's paper, the Liberator, in the reading-room of the seminary. For some time they could not find out who did it; but they suspected Lucy, because of her anti-slavery principles, and, when they asked her, she acknowledged it at once. Even the saintly Mary Lyon was doubtful about the wisdom of allowing it. She said to Lucy, "You nuist remember that the slavery question is a very grave question, and a question u)Â«)n which the best people are di- vided."
