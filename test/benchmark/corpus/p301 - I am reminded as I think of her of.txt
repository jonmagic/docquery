"I am reminded, as I think of her, of Mrs. Fisher's perfect fairness of mind and firmness in the maintenance of what she deems to be right. She has no compromise with error or evil. She is always earnest in her convictions anfl steadfast in her loyalt)'^ to duty. She never turns aside for secondary considerations, and never surrenders. She sees the right clearly, and devotes herself with entire consecration and self-sacrifice, as evidenced in her long ser- vice in the church and in her imswerving fidelity to her home. She is an optimist. The greatness of her trust inspires and strengthens her. She fills a large i)lace in the conmuunty through her silent inHuence, and with all her usefulness and power Ikm- life is crowned with rare modesty."

Her tireless and constant thought is for the welfare of those with whom she is associated, even to the neglect of her own best physical welfare. The virtue of altruism, much alluded to in recent years, Mrs. Fisher has been prac- tising all her life. She has often said that her first thought, duty, and effort were due to her home: her second, to her church and Sunday- school; and, if she had any reserve strength, it was at the service of any good cause that needed it the most. In addition to more press- ing duties she has found time to advocate and labor for the enfranchisement of woman, giving her opportiunty to rise to her highest level.

Mrs. Fisher was among th(&gt; earliest to join the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and has remained an earnest and ('on.sistent mem- ber. She early united her efforts with others in aid of the Baldwinsville Hospital ('ottages for the care and treatment of children afflicted with epileptic and allied diseases.

Believing that, so long as the impelling mo- tive of humanity is a selfish one, so long will the kingdom of heaven be postponed, here or elsewhere, Mrs. Fisher sympathizes with the present trend toward sociological ideals. Her character antl tlisposition are such that she cannot tolerate or excuse the wrongs of society resulting from the worship of mammon, with its consequent development of selfishness, the prolific mother of evil and crime. The only effective remedy, in her estimation, is public ownershiji of all public utilities, replacing com- petition by co-operation. Then, as she reasons, the world would be in a position to realize some- thing of the true spirit of Jesus of Nazareth, whose life bore testimony to the brotherhood of man.

These words from Miss Frances E. Willard are in line with her thought : " I believe the things tliat Christian .socialism stands for. It is Goil's way out of the wilderness and into the promised land. It is the marrow and fat- ness of Christ's gospel. It is Christianitv ap- plied."
