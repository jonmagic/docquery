Yearning for growth, she gave up a certainty for an uncertainty, and with characteristic .self-reliance resolutely turnetl toward the un- known future. Boarding an ocean steamer and waving a farewell to the friends on shore, she sailed out of the Golden Gate with the fixed purpose of entering upon a new, broader, and therefore more u.seful career. Going first to Philadelphia, she spent one year in study in that city, and th(&gt;n, in 1S8I, came to Boston, the field of her later activities.

Here, in a strange city, with new surround- ings, occui^ation gone, restless for something to tlo, .she incidentally entered upon the study of shorthand, at that time attracting con- siderable public attention, to the practical development of which, along original lines, she has since devotetl her time, talent, anil financial resources. The chief features of her achievements in this direction may be briefly sunnnari'zed as follows: — ■

In 1883 instituted "The Home School of Shorthand and Typewriting." In 1888 pub- lished her first shorthand text-book, "The Chandler Practical Shorthand for Schools and Colleges," now in its sixth edition and exten- sively used in the public schools of New Eng- lanil. In 1890 introiluceil her system of .short- hand into the Gloucester High School, when&gt; its merit was promptly recognized. In 1893

founded the Chandler Normal Shorthantl School, chiefly for the training of teachers, the first .school of its kind in the world. In 1895 called a Public School Shorthand Convention, the first in the history of education. In 1895 foundeil the f^handler Thinking Club, for the promotion of individual growth by indepen- dent thinking. In 1898 founded a periodical called The Thinker, which has met with a cordial rece])tion at the hands of the public.

The original i)lanks of her shorthaiul educa- tional platform were two — "Quality, not quan- tity," "Legibility, not guessibility" — to which the following has since been added, "A uni- form shorthantl in the public schools.'

Mrs. Atherton is a member of the Free Re- ligious Association of America, an organization broad enough to meet the retjuirements of her liberal spirit.

Being the embodiment of enthusiasm, she is a natural leader and to the young an unfailing source of inspiration. The high esteem in which she is held by those who have come under her direct influence is indicateil by the following extract from the constitution of the National Association of Chandler Shorthand Writers, re- cently (1904) organized by them: "The object of this association .shall be to extend and per- petuate, through the means of a permanent organization, the valuable work which Mary Aklerson Atherton has done for humanity in the interest of true education and character- building."

It may be truthfully said that Mrs. Atherton has contributed something of value to the age in which she lives.

KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN (Mrs. George C. Riggs) is an author whom New Englanders like to claim as one of their own number, her inherited tastes and aptitudes being derived from generations of New p]nghuKl ancestry. Of the dift'erent localities that have known her as a resident she herself has thus s|joken: "Pennsylvania was the State of my birth, Maine was where my childhood and happy girlhood were passed, California is the scene of all the practical work I have done among poor children, while my
