In 1883 a committee of visitors, with Mrs. Calkins as chairman, was appointed to organ- ize a day nur.sery and raise funds for its sup- port. To this nursery in 1885 were succes- sively added a labor bureau and an industrial laundry. These several departments were soon successfully united in a building of their own under the name of the Industrial House Char- ities. This institution has continued its help-

ful work in caring for infants, teaciiing laun- dr3nng, and providing ])laces for days' work for destitute widows and deserted wives with young children and other j)r)or women.

In 1879 Mrs. Calkins was apj^ointed by Mayor Powers one of the first board of trus- tees of the City Hospital, and more especially for its reorganization, as up to that time it had no medical staff or systematic hospital management. Mrs. Calkins is still a member of the corporation of the SpringfieUl Hospital, an outgrowth of the former institution.

In 1883 Mrs. Calkins resigned from all char- ity boards except that of the day nursery, and accompanied her husband and son to Europe for a period of rest, study, and recreation. She improved this opportunity to visit chari- table institutions ami schools in London and Vienna, oKserving their methods and manage- ment.

In 1886 Mrs. Calkins was elected a member of the school conuuittee of Springfield. This position she held for twelve years, helping to inaugurate the modern and progressive methods that have made Springfield schools prominent in the State and country. Cooking, kinder- gartens, suitable lunches at minimum cost for high school scholars, were among the especial objects of her attention, also the proper .sani- tary conditions of the school-rooms for growing children, including hygienic seats and desks, ])roper arrangement of light, cleanliness, and school architecture.

In 1891 the organization of the Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution came to the notice of Mrs. Calkins through a newspajjer item. She at once sought ilefi- nite information concerning the society, and in a few months became a member. On De- cember 17 of the same year she was appointed chapter regent for Springfield, the first aj)- pointed in the State. On the 17th of June, 1892, she formally organized the first chapter in the State, the Mercy Warren, with twenty- three charter members. She retained the regency until October, 1893, when the chapter was well established with one hundred and twenty-eight members. The pressure of other duties now reijuired her retirement. In 1901 Mrs. Calkins again accepted the regency for

one year, and on lier resignation was made honorary life regent.

The chapter early appointed a committee to seek out the neglected and forgotten graves of the Revolutionary soldiers of Springfield, and ever since that time they have been marked. Sixteen "real" daughters have been accepted members of the chapter, and their lives made brighter and in neeiled cases more comforta- ble by the kindly offices of a standing com- mittee appointed for the purpose. The chap- ter has contributed to various patriotic objects, including fifty dollars for the relief of the Cuban reconcentrados; but in no direction has its work been more gratifying than in the local reawakening of a general interest in colonial and Revolutionary history.
