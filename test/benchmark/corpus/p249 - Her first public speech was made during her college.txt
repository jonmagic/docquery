Her first public speech was made during her college course. The colored people got up a celebration of the anniversary of West Indian emancipation, and invited her to be one of the speakers. The president of the col- lege and some of the professors were also in- vited. She gave licr address among the rest, and thought nothing of it. The next day she was sunmioned before the Ladies' Board (a sort of advisory boartl, composed of the pro- fessors' wives, who supervised the young women of the college). They represented to her that it was unwomanly and unscriptural for her to speak in public. The president's wife said: "Did you not feel yourself very nmch out of place up there on the platform among all those men? Were you not embarrassed and frightened?" "Why, no, Mrs. Mahan," she answered. "'Those men' were President Mahan and my professors, whom I meet every day in the class-room. I was not afraid of them at all!" She was allowed to go, with an

admonition. She was repeatedly called before the Ladies' Board to answer for some departure from custom, but she always defended herself with modesty and finnness, and she generally came off victorious.

She was always ready to lend a helping hand to any fellow-student who needed it. She darned the young men's stockings, mended their clothes, and gave them sisterlj' sympathy and good counsel. Old men still living speak with gratitude of her defending them from ridicule anfl taking them comfortingly under her wing when they were uncouth country boys, new to the college and its ways. I\Iany yellow old letters from her classmates, both men and women, testify to the deep impres- sion her character made upon them, and the respect and warm affection that she inspired.

She was small and slender, with gray eyes, a lovely rosy comjjlexion, and dark brown hair. Her fine health made her always look younger than her age. When between thirty and forty, she was sometimes taken for a girl of eighteen.

While Lucy was at Oberlin, a beautiful and gifted girl, named Antoinette Brown, entered the college, with the purpose, up to that time un- precedented for a woman, of studying theology and becoming a minister. In the stage-coach on her way to Oberlin she was cautioned against a singular and dangerous young woman named Lucy Stone, whose radical ideas were the talk of the college. In spite of this warning, An- toinette and Lucy contracted a friendship which was cemented in later life by their marry- ing brothers. These two girls and a few of the others wished to pi'actise themselves in discus- sion, and asked leave to speak in the college debates. These debates were a regular part of the course, and the yoiuig women were re- quired to attend them, in order to furnish an audience for the young men, but were not allowed themselves to take part. After a good deal of hesitation, permission was given for the girls to have one debate. They ac- quitted themselves finely; but the faculty felt that any i)ublic speaking by women was un- scriptural and improper, and they refused to let it be continued. The young women then determined to have a debatmg society of their
