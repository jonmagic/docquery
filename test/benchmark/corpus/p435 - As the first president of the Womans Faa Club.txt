As the first president of the Woman's Fa-a Club of Boston, Mrs. Ruffin has gained a na- tional reputation. This club was formed "for colored women and by colored women, to the end that problems of vital interest to the col- ored jjopulation might be discussed." From the beginning the club evinced a progressive spirit, and the meetings were full of interest. Mrs. Ruflin is an able woman, well read, keen- witted, pleasing in manner, and has the uplift- ing of the colored race sincerely at heart. She, more than any other woman, formed the club, and much of the success is due to her good sense and enterprise.

In L'^QS it was decided to hoUl a national convention of colored women in Boston. This convention was decitledly interesting, ami the outcome was the formation of a federation of colored women's clubs. Since 1895 the W^oman's Era Club has been connected with the Massa- chusetts State Federation, and its president has participated in the sessions of the State conference. Mrs. Ruffin has also been elected a member of the Massachusetts State Federa- tion and an officer on its boartl.

The Woman's Era Club continues its meet- ings twice each month, and a few white women, who were cordially welcomed to membership,

have participated in its deliberations. " We never drew a color line," said one of the mem- bers. Mrs. Hannah C. Smith, former corre- sponding secretary, states that its object is educational rather than benevolent, but that it has \mdertaken a number of philanthrojjic plans and carried them tlirough successfully. Several scholarships in colored educational in- stitutions have been purchased, and in this way many who would not have l)ad an educa- tion otherwise have been provide&lt;l for. At the outset the club was divided into several classes and each placed under the direction of a leader. These classes discu.ssed civics, do- mestic science, literature, public improve- ments, and questions of importance to the col- ored race! Circulars written by members of the club uj)on important questions have been issued, and numerous copi&lt;^s circulated. Money has been raised and expended, which has aided in promoting the welfare of the colored race in Boston and other cities. Assistance has also been given to worthy charities.

In 1900 the club accepted an urgent invita- tion to join the General Federation, and their application was forwarded by the State secre- tary. Mrs. R. D. Lowe, president, promptly returned a certificate of membership, and offi- cially expressed her pleasure at the action of the club. It was then entitled to be repre- sented at the biennial convention of the Na- tional Federation at Milwaukee, Wis., in June, 1900. Mrs. Ruffin was chosen its delegate. She journeyed to Milwaukee as a representa- tive also from the New England Woman's Press Association and from the Massachusetts Federation of Women's Clubs. The progranune conmiittee of the National FediM'ation refused to allow Mrs. Ruffin to appear before the con- vention and extenil greetings. She was de- nietl recognition as a delegate, notwithstanding the elo(iuent pleadings of rej)resentatives from many States. Telegrams armouncing this de- cision were sent to all parts of th(&gt; country, and hunilnnls of editorials were ]nil)lished by the press, conmientiiig on the subjcci, whicli had become one of national interest. Many protests were officially promulgated by local clubs, and some' have witlidiawn from the Federation.
