Captain Ebenezer Eastman was the first settler of Concord, N.H. He was a man of resolute courage, and had six sturdy sons. As he had also considerable property, he soon became "the strong man of the town." It is of interest to note that from this simple Salis- bury stock came the intellectual acumen of Daniel Webster and the spiritual vision of John G. Whittier.

Daniel Webster was born at Salisbury, N.H., 1782. He was the second son of a small farmer and justice of the county court, Ebenezer Webster. His mother was Abigail Eastman, fifth in line of descent from Rodger Eastman, original settler, ancestor of the subject of this sketch.

Fifth in the line of descent from Stephen Flanders, "original settler" at Salisbury, Mass., was James Manders, E.sq., of Warner, N.H., who was Mi.ss Eastman's great-grandfather. He was a piominent citizen, and represented his constituency in the House and Senate of New â€¢ Hampshire for twenty-four consecutive years. His loyalty to conviction appears in the fact that at one period he refused to take the oath of office to support the Constitution unless he could add the words "except in so far as it recognizes human slavery." This tied the legislative body up in a debate which lasted three days, at the end of which time he was allowed to take his seat.

The same quality conspicuous in James appears in his son Philip, the maternal grand- father of Miss Eastman.

He was a farmer, and was the father of six- teen children. He was held in the highest

esteem for his sterling qualities. Like most worthy citizens of the perioil, he was a member of the Orthodox Congregational church; but, having read reports of the doctrines preached in England by John Murray, he pondered over the new faith, and finally went into his regular church prayer-meeting and said, "Brethren, I have seen a great light." ITe then stated the new belief of the so-called " Universalists," that a loving God would, in his own good time, bring back all sinners to himself; and he added, " I have reflected upon it, and I think it may be true." The shock to his fellow church mem- bers, that so good a man should thus depart from the faith of his fathers, was very great. At his funeral, in the presence of the twelve surviving children, the minister extolled his .virtues, but said, "We don't know where Major Flanders has gone." Miss Eastman's mother, one of the younger of the twelve, remembers the shock which fell upon them at such a decree. On the next Sunday, however, in a funeral discourse, the same minister said, referring to the fact that Mr. Flanders was member-elect of the New Hampshire Legislature, " Brother Flanders will not represent us in the courts of earth, but we know that he represents us in the courts of heaven."

The simple trust which characterized the father descended to all but one of his many children, and the courage of conviction seems to have done so likewise, so that succeeding generations have rejoiced in any light which broke for them from the clouds of error, and, like him, they "were not disobedient to the heavenly vision."
