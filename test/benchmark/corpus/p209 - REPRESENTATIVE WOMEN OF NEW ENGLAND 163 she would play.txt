she would play on the piano, giving a left -ham 1 accompaniment, while the remarkable memory for committing music began to develop also. Miss MacGregor has had the benefit of the best instruction in piano playing, harmony, and counteri)oint, umler Carl Baermann, of Boston, Dudley Buck, of New York, and other leatling teachers. Her first compositions of instru- mental music were marches, which have re- ceiveil the commendation of Ciilmore, Sousa, Jean Mi.ssud, and other leading band-masters in this country, who have paid her the high compliment of adapting and ])laying them on important occasions. At the Maine Musical Festival given in Portland in October, 1899, her compositions were jilayed, and received great favor. Of late she has been turning her attention with marked success to song-writing almost exclusively, and numbers among her productions some very taking songs: a luUaby, "We're sailing to Dreamland" (with violin obli- gato); "My Phyllis"; "The Old Love"; Sere- nade; "Now and Then"; and "() Lassie, be True to me," a Scottish song for contralto, which has been received most favorably. ( )f her in- strumental music the "Dirigo March," "The Bowdoin," "The Gaiety" (two-step), and the "Colonial Dames Waltzes" are best known. Some of her most recent compositions are: "Little Gems for Little Folks" (a set of eight pieces for piano), and "The Fadette Two-step," dedicated to Carohne Nichols, leader of Fatlctte Woman's Orchestra.

As a prominent member of the Rossini Club, an organization of Portlanil ladies, she is iden- tified with the musical interests, not only of Maine, but of all New England. She is a member of the Shubert Concert Company (as pianist and accompanist), and has been a mem- ber of the Boston Lleal (,)uartette (miscellane- ous). Miss MacGregor has ixho given a numljcr of muscal lecture recitals on famous composers, besides one on " Contemporary Women Com- posers," and two others entitled res|);--ctively " Development of the Op^ra," and " Formation of the Ballad," all illustrated by nms-c. Her services musically have always been freely given for charity, and few nuisiciaiis have contributed more lilierally of their talent and time than Miss MacGregor.
