Dorcas Harvey, the only daughter of her parents, was married August 9, 1870, to Will- iam Henry Lyman, of Brighton. Mr. Lyman served throughout the Civil War in Company H, Sixteenth Mas.sachusetts Volunteers. He is a member of Francis Washburn Post, No. 92, G. A. R., of Brighton.

Mrs. Lyman is interested not only in patri- otic work, but in many other leading move- ments of the day. She is a member of the Congregational church, Brighton, and has been actively associated with its missionary enter- prises. The beautiful chapel in Faneuil, ded- icated in 1900 through the efforts of her brother antl others, received her active support, and she was a substitute teacher in its Sunday-school.

She is an active member of the King's Daugh- ters, also of the W'oman's Christian Temper- ance Union, and a worker in the Brighton and AUston \\'oman Suffrage League. For the past ten years she has served as chairman of the Connnittee of Independent Women Voters of Ward 25, Boston, a position requiring a knowledge of political conditions, (juick dis- cernment, and executive ability. The most prominent citizens of the Bhgiiton district

recognize Mrs. Lyman's efficiency, and candi- dates favoring honest government and reform measures have often owed their election largely to her su])port.

Mrs. Lyman united with Francis Washburn Relief Corps, No. 79, Brighton, in 1887, and, after filling every other office in the corps, was elected president three successive years â€” 1892, 1893, 1894. She was a Department Aide in 1893, 1894, and 1899 and a National Aide in 1895, 1898, and 1902. She has served as a delegate in National Conventions every year but one since 1887. As a member of the Department Relief and other important committees, she has rendered invaluable ser- vice. In 1897 she sent twenty-five dollars to the Ander.sonville Prison Board of the Na- tional W. R. C, and was the first contributor to the fund for preserving that historic ground as a permanent memorial.

Mrs. Lyman was specially active in the emer- gency work for the boys of the S]&gt;anish- Ameri- can War, and through the entire sununer of 1898 was on duty as one of the Connnittee of the Volunteer Aid Association. She solicited money and needful articles for the soldiers at the front, packed supplies for the hospital ship (the "Bay State"), and, when the regi- ments returned from Cuba, visited every week for several months the soldiers in the hos])itals in Boston. She has also secured contributions for the troops in the Phili])i)ines.

After serving as a member of the Dejiart- ment Executive Board several years (one year as chairman), she was elected Department Junior Vice-President at the annual State convention held in Boston in 1900. A brill- iant reception was tendered her by Corps No. 79 and Post No. 92 of Brighton. Previous to her election Post No. 92, of Brighton, hail is- sued a hearty endorsement of her candidacy, saying: "We of this post know Mrs. Lyman's worth, her love for the veterans, her intense loyalty to the nation, her tireless and inde- fatigable energy and labor for the Grand Army of tiie Republic as well as for the Relief Corps. Early ami late, in sunshine antl storm, she has laboretl for their interests as much, we be- lieve, as any woman in the department has for a post to which a corps is auxiliary."
