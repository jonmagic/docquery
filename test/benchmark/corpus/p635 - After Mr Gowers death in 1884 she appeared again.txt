After Mr. Gower's death in 1884, she appeared again in opera at Covent Garden, London, and in all the principal opera houses of Europe and America. Up to this time Nordica had con- fineti herself to French and Italian roles, but during a visit to Bayreuth in 1893 she was asked to create the role of Elsa in " Lohengrin," and, learning the German language in five months, made her appearance at the end of that time. She elicited much enthusiasm, and it was a season of triumph. Her repertoire now embraces forty operas and all the stand- ard oratorios. She is best known in Wag- nerian parts. In the United States she has appeared in grand opera several seasons.

She speaks fluently all the languages in which she sings. Personally she is a woman of much charm and magnetism, as well as beauty. She has a gracious manner, and is especially loyal to her old friends.

She married a few years ago Herr Zoltan Dome.

She takes an interest in her native State, and from time to time visits her birthplace.
