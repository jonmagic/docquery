REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Miss Isabella Thoburn, sister of Bishop Thoburn. An appeal for a medical woman soon followed. As a result of prompt and efficient measures to procure funds, the services of Miss Tho- burn and of Clara A. Swain, M.D., were secured. These two women sailed from New York for India, via England, on November 3, 1869, reaching their destination early in January, 1870. These first laborers of the new society in a foreign field were cordially received, and soon entered upon a good work, Miss Thoburn organizing schools and superintending the work of Bible readers, and Dr. Swain's medical ability gaining for her admission to many places that w^ere closed to others. This society sent to India, China, Korea, and Japan the first woman medical missionary ever received in those countries. Now, in its thirty-fourth year (1903) it has two hundred and sixty-five missionaries carrying on its work in far India, China, Japan, Korea, Africa, Bulgaria, Italy, South America, Mexico, and the Philippines, by means of women's colleges, high schools, seminaries, hospitals, dispensaries, day schools, and " settle- ment work," as it is called in America.

The society was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1884. Its receipts during the first year were four thousand five hundred forty-six dollars and eighty-six cents, and in the year 1903 four hundreil ninety-one thousand ninety-one dollars and seventy-five cents, with a total from the beginning of six million eight hundred and fifty thousand eight hundred fifty-three dollars. Six Branches were organized the first year. There are now eleven, the first the New England, and the eleventh the Columbia River Branch.

The first number of the society's first peri- odical, the Heathen Woman's Friend, appeared in June, 1869. Mrs. Warren, wife of William F. Warren, D.D., President of Boston University, was its editor for twenty-four years, be- ginning at the time when women editors were so rare as to make the position one of isola- tion. Financially it was a plunge into the unex- plored wilderness, there being no money behind the paper and no influence, except that of a handful of women whose hearts and brains were devoted to sending to foreign fields their first missionaries. But the result proved to

be a financial success, for in thirty years it not only paid its own expenses, but contributed over thirty thousand dollars for the publica- tion and scattering of leaflets and other mis- sionary literature which has proved to be the " leaves of the tree for the healing of the na- tions." Mrs. Warren penned her last editorial, "The Bugle-call," on Thursday, January 5, 1893, two days before the close of her earthly life.

Harriet Cornelia Merrick Warren, daugh- ter of John M. and Mary J. Merrick, was born in Wilbraham, Mass., September 15, 1843, and was educated at Wilbraham Academy, of which her father was a trustee. Married April 14, 1861, to the Rev. William F. Warren, slie went with him to Bremen, Germany, where he served for some time as a professor in the Missions- Anstalt. Possessed of scholarly tastes and capabilities, Mrs. Warren while abroad con- tinued to cultivate her mind, successfully pur- suing advanced studies in history, languages, literature, music, and art, also spending some time profitably with her husbantl in travelling. " She returned after five years a large-minded and thoroughly ecjuipped woman, full of resources, and with good practical judgment and tact that admirably fitted hei' for the position .she was to occupy as the wife of a man at the head of one of the most important educational enterprises in the church and in tlie country." She was an untiring worker in the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, its first recording secretary, and for years president of the New England Branch, and an accomplished editor.
