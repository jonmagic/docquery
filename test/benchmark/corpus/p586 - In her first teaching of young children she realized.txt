In her first teaching of young children she realized strongly their need of a natural system ; and oftentimes a music lesson was given the little student on the vine-covered porch or

under the garden trees, the piano being sought after the problems in hand had been solved to the satisfaction of teacher and pupil. She waited, hoping that some one else would bring out such a system as she herself was unwittingly in process of unfo'ding. As life's experience deepened, further insight was gained into these matters; and within three years after her mar- riage, which occurred in the spring of 1892, the birth of her first child, Linda Frederika (December, 1894), brought the experience and joys of motherhood. Her life was further en- riched by a second daughter, Aylsa Winona Lewis, born in January, 1896. Three years of invalidism gave her opportunity for quiet thought and earnest pondering on many things.

The lack of a general musical atmosphere was apparent, and the need of such for the budding thought made her long to gather the little ones about her and create at least some intelligent love for the beauty of art and the ability to grasp inner meanings of harmony so success- fully hitlden from the ignoramus in the tone world.

Many unanswered questions had pursuetl her from her early years, questions which her elders could not answer. She had soon observeil that the child nurtured under its mother's influence was the one to achieve in the world's history of great deeds; also that the child of genius was permitted to unfold in the first attempts at expression without interference from out- side. U'hat was the cause back of these effects? She knew that The Creator who had createtl all things good could not fail to give humanity a remetly for every ill. The God of Love could not omit that which would heal every broken life and heart, but why the necessity of pass- ing through neeiUess agony to learn lessons easily taught? Surely there must be a preven- tative of such perversion of the natural in an educational system that would allow the child to find himself wholesomely in the kingdom of the Eternal King, under whose laws he might unfoUl and expand naturally, growing daily in brightness and beauty within until the full time of expression, when, like the bud opening into flower, the well-balanced child would enter a serene manhood or womanhood, growing healthfully because his true instincts

had been nourished and strengthened, not thwarted nor suppressed until reaction and per- version had occurred. Such questions were stirring the active thought of the founder of the "Science of Music and Education" for fifteen years, unanswered and unsolved by any system in existence. " Are not all hearts seek- ing for the same remedy?" she argued, and in the wholeness of her searching prayer the answer was reflected. In a single night the light dawned, her health was restored, the discovery made! The truth of the natural law of unfoldment and its relation to the child was revealed. God's gift to little children was no longer a dream, but a present reality. To take the message at once to the little ones became her greatest neetl.
