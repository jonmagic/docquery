individual imd prescribe for his need rather than to his wants. Many a poor creature, dis- couraged and heart-sick, as well as miserably poor of this world's goods, could testify to the ministration to both bodily and spiritual needs; and scores in want of employment or perhaps unfitted to their present employment could tell of a changed burden, that from its lightness and because it better fitted their shoulders seemed no burden at all. To bring the mind of man in accord with Gad's great plans for the human race, and thus bring the universe in concord with the Creator, is the tremendous aim of those who planned the Procopeia Club.

In 1895 "Mrs. Helen \an Anderson, seeking to establish a new and unsectarian church, afterwanl named by Professor Trine the Church of the Higher Life, came to Mrs. Kirby for the executive aid she felt that lady was capable of giving. It was incorporated the same year, with Mrs. Kirby as its president. Later a service was held in Allen Hall, ordaining and installing with impressive ceremony Mrs. Van Anderson as its minist(&gt;r, among the clergy- men to officiate being the Rev. Minot J. Savage, the Rev. Antoinette Blackwell, and others of note.

With all this puljlic work Mrs. Kirby still founil time to attend to 'social duties, to be at home to her friends, antl to put her thoughts on paper in the form of essays and poems. These, published as the result of her experiences in philanthropic work, brought to her a huge correspondence in the shape of questions and requests for spiritual aid, and entailetl an impossible amount of writing. This also provetl even more conclusively, if that weie necessary, that a great number of people were reaching out for a strength and hope they longed for, but did not know how to obtain. Under each question, beneath every inquiry, was the spirit of unrest — a lack of conununion and understanding of God's plans for his creat- ures. How was that cry to be answered, and those needs, how were they to be met ?

The Faith and Hope Fund, planned by Mrs. Kirby, was a step in the right (lirection. It ac- complished enough to lead to tlie present Faith and Hope Association, formed in Sep- tember, 1896, and incorporated in October of

the same year. The present home of the asso- ciation is at the new Boylston Chambers, Boylston Street, Boston. Mrs. Kirby is its president, assisted by a board of directors.

Perhaps no better idea of the work can be given than in the words of the president her- self, dedicated to the association and i.ssued Christmas, 1901:—

" Love thouglits on angels' wings do fly Forever through the azure sky. With Faith they touch the hearts of all, While Hope awakens at their call.

" Love will redeem and set aside All prejudice, thus open wide The door of sunshine and of peace, To bid unrest forever cease.
