Moses Perry, son of Nathan and one of a family of eight children, was born in 1762, and lived to be eighty years old. He succeeded to the ownerslii|) of tlie home farm, was indus- trious, frugal, and tlu'ifty, and although his schooling, it is said, had been limited to six weeks, he was nuich respected as a man of in- telligence anil influence, a slow speaker, l)ut one whose words carried weight. With a placid temper he combined great force of character. It is related of him that at a church meeting where the members were becoming e.xcited he arose and said: " Brethren, we are getting pretty warm. I think we had better go home, and I shall set the example." He then took his hat and started. He was a deacon in the South Church thirty-five years and in the I'nion Church six years. His wife, Hannah Hall, whom he married in 1791, died in November, 1861, at ninety-three years of age. She is spoken of as having been somewhat eccentric and "perhaps lacking balance of mind," but of a "kindly, social nature, very fond of her cluu'ch, and with a wond(&gt;rful memory for the sermon." They had eight children, five sons and three daughters. Three of the sons were ministers of the gospel, and two were farmers, one settling in Central New York, and the other, Samu(&gt;l, in Worcester. Two of the daughters married farmers. One was the

mother of fourteen children; the other, of twelve.

SamueP Perry, the next owner and occupant of the Worcester farm, was horn Novemljer 26, 1796, died Feliruary 12, 1878. His wife, Mary Harrington, whom lie wedded in December, 1823, was born March 20, 1804, daughter of Francis Harrington, Jr. She died Feliruary 18, 1869. Her grandfather Harrington bought land in Worcester, and settled there in 1740. When Samuel Perry married, on three sides of his farm was a dense forest. In preparing to make a home for his bride he cut down the first tree at the north. He .served as a Captain in the militia, and for thirty-five years was a deacon of the Union Church, of which he was one of the founders. He was very benev- olent, a man of good judgment in affairs, and a peacemaker in the church and neighbor- hood. Opposed to the renting of jjews, he took upon himself to secure subscriptions, col- lect the money, and pay the bills. When he could not collect what was pledged, he paitl it himself. He had ten children. One son, David Brainard Perry, D.D., a graduate of Yale, was for some years a home missionary in Nebraska and is now president of Doane College. An- other son was a successful business man, autl three were farmers. Of the five daughters, four became teachers, in time marrying in- telligent, well-to-do business men. The other ilaughter, Mary S. Perry, who died in Worces- ter, August 8, 1902, was much beloved as a "woman of rare qualities of heart and mind, of great synijiathy for the unfortunate, with keen appreciation of the beautiful in nature, a wide range of reading and thought, remarkable knowledge of the Scri|)tures, and great rev- erence for sacred things." A vohune of her poems published during her last illness is held as a precious legacy.
