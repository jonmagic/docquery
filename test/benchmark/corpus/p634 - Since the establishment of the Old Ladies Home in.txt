Since the establishment of the Old Ladies' Home in Augusta, Mrs. Lnmbard has been on its Board of Managers, and she is now holding the office of Vice-Presitlent. When Augusta's City Hospital was incorporated, and the Hos- pital Aid Society was formed, Mrs. Lambard was elected President. In that capacity she faithfully served until 1901, when she resigned. As a willing helper and most generous donor, her name will always be associated with the

institution. In its few years of existence this hospital, at the State capital, has a record that places it among the most useful and most ad- mirably conducted institutions of its kind in the State. When it was first opened, in 1897, the work was carried on in a rented building, but in 1900 the closing of the Girls' School at St. Catherine's Hall gave the directors an op- portunity to purchase a building well adapted to hospital recjuirements. "It is a large and noble-looking structure, built in the beautiful old colonial style of architecture, and situated on an elevation, which secures not only the sanitary advantages that come from perfect drainage, but sunshine and pure air." It commands a superb view of the Kemiebec valley, and is an ideal home for the sick. Its equipments are all modern and first-class, the staff able and the directors may well claim that "there is not a hosj)ital in the country that is contlucted on broader lines or with a more sincere ilesire to meet fully and fairly all possible needs of the public it serves."

He was an interesting and original preacher, and was distinguished for his wit and ready repartee. He served as chaplain in the Maine House of Representatives in 1879 and 1881. Madame Nordica's mother was a woman of broad intelligence and marked executive ability. Christian graces adorning her character.

As a bit of old New Englaml history it is interesting to note that Nordica's great-grand- father, Nathaniel Hersey, was in 1777 taxeil for his "faculty," with four other citizens of the town, who were regarded as possessing marketl business capacity.
