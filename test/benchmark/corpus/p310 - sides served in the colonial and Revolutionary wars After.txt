sides served in the colonial and Revolutionary wars.

After graduating from Fryeburg Academy in 1882, Miss Barrows taught in the public schools of that town and of Conway, N.H. From her girlhood she w'as a practical housekeeper, and before leaving Fryeburg she served in many capacities, from that of organist in the Con- gregational church, of which she is a member, to that of village postmistress. In 1886 she took the normal course at the Boston Cooking School under Miss Ida Maynard. The follow- ing autumn, after supervising the opening of a new cottage at Wellesley College, in which a full system of domestic work was to be tried, she became the teacher of cooking at the North Bennet Street Industrial School, Boston, where she remained five years. This was before man- ual training was included in the regular studies of the public schools. A class from a different school came at each session. ' The N^eiv England Journal of Education, com- menting on her work, said, " Miss Anna Barrows has made such a success of cooking as an edu- cational force, as well as an industrial activity, that her work deserves study, and commands the respect of the most devout student of peda- gogy, as well as of specialties." Mr. Howells, the novelist, after watching a boys' class in cooking at that school, said that he had " heard more natural philosophy demonstrated in half an hour than some people acquired in the whole course of their lives."

In 1891 Miss Barrows resigned, to accept the position of instructor in the School of Do- mestic Science connected with the Boston Young Women's Christian Association, and in addition to this work gave lectures and class instruction in cookery at Lasell Seminary, Au- burndale, Mass. The growing public interest in domestic science and consequent demand for lectures occupied so much time that the routine school work was given up for the larger field.

Miss Barrows has lectured for women's clubs and given over a thousand demonstrations in cookery in many States. She has lectured in New York for several seasons in the Farmers' Institute courses, and has given addresses before many State agricultural organizations

in that ami other States, as the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, the Maine Pomological Society, the Vermont Dairymen's Association, and the Western New York Horticultural Soci- ety. At the present time the only regular school work that Miss Barrows continues is an annual course of fifteen weekly lessons at Robinson Seminary, Exeter, N.H.

In 1894 she became one of the editors and proprietors of the (then New England) Ameri- can Kitchen Magazine, a monthlj' devoted to home science, in which much of her writing was published until March, 1904, when she severed her connection with the Home Science Pub- lishing Company.

For other periodicals she has written many articles on her specialty and allied topics. She has published a small book on Eggs, and with Mrs. Mary J. Lincoln, the "?Iome Science Cook Book," and has other books in preparation.
