discussion of excellences: she had given us nothing else for discussion.

From a mass of press notices of her work I learn that her more recent recitals have been the "Blot in the 'Scutcheon," before men- tioned, and Stephen Phillips's " Paolo and Fran- cesca." From their great variety of character, their delicate shadings of sentiment, their pathos, triumjih, tragedy, for one person to present these dramas even passably well would require talent of a high order. Yet these no- tices are one and all testimonials, not of fair achievement, but of proud success. They come from diverse sources, but there is no dilTerence in the general juilgment; and they impart to my mind the suspicion that in these later efTorts she has beaten her best hitherto. While, how- ever, there is no difference in the general judg- ment, there is a tlifference in the point of em- phasis. Prevailingly they witness to the gen- eral and popular effect. One or two write, as artists, of the manner, personation, intonation. Neither order of representation can be ade- quate: for any just account of her, both are absolutely needful. While our friend has stud- ied her art broadly and deeply, its spirit has become life within her. Hence, when she deals with a public assembly, there is no suggestion of artifice. All seems as natural as her most quiet parlor conversation. Nothing is for effect, nothing is exaggerated. Rant, by which like artists of a lower order seek to prosper, and unhappily often do, is far, far from her. There is such harmony of detail with detail, and all so related to the grand meaning of the whole as to make it a scene of life that is offered you. In other words, her art is obscured by its own perfection.

All who know Mrs. Humphrey-Smith talk of her voice, its richness of tone, its range, its flexibility. Its carrying power is a striking feature. An audience of three thousand in a hall of the best acoustic construction will test the powers of a good speaker; yet Mrs. Hum- phrey-Smith has recited with ease and success to six thousand people out of doors. This sug- gests a feature of her voice that has interested me. It is precisely the voice I used to hear in that country school-house. In the utterance of the stormiest dramatic passion any schoolmate

of those distant years would recognize it. It is the same voice with its grand possibilities unfolded.

With fine conversational powers and ready sympathy and the large resource she has gath- ered in her studies, she is a most agreeable companion and in society a happy presence. Of those who meet her there, few can ever suspect that the magnet of her heart is a couple of graves. Yet it is so. And here we touch another feature of her history that tinges the rest with a tender light. In her dealing with the workl, though most prodigal of her smiles, she has been frugal of her tears. Her burdens have been many and heavy, but through all she has carried the hand of help and the word of cheer.
