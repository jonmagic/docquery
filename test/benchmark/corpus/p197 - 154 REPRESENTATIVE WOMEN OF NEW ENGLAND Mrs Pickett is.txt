JLLIA MARIA BAKER, wife of William James Baker, of Worcester, was born in that city, October 13, 1830, daughter of Sanuiel and Mary (Harrington) Perry. In a published article by Professor Arthur L. Perry, LL.D., entitled ''An Ancestral Re- search," whence has been derived some of the early historj' and genealogy that follows, the Perry lineage is traced back to the Rev. John Perry, of Farnborough (now Fareham, Hamp- shire), Englantl, who died in 1621. The clergy- man's son John, shortly after his father's death, was apjirenticed to learn the cloth-workers' trade. He married Johanna, daughter of Jo- seph Holland, a cloth-worker and citizen of London. Her father's will, dated 1659, printed in Waters's "Genealogical Gleanings," makes becjuests to his "son-in-law, John Perry, and Johanna, his wife, my daughter," and their three children. It was this John' Perry who, accompanied by his son John,^ came to New England and settled in AA'atertown, near Bos- ton, near the close of the year 1666 or early in 1667.

John- Perry married in Watertown in Decem- ber, 1667, Sarah Clary. They had nine chil- dren, Josiah,^ born in 1684, being the seventh. Josiah' Perry married Bethiah Cutter, daugh- ter of Ephraim and Bethiah (Wood) Cutter and grand-daughter of Richard' Cutter. Nathan'' Perry, born in 1718, was one of their ten chil- dren. He married at Watertown in 1746

Hannah Fiske. The Perrys of Watertown in colonial times were engaged in some form of cloth-working, being mostly weavers and tailors. Bethiah, first wife of Josiah Perry and mother of his children, died in 1735, and his second wife, Elizabeth, died in 1748. In 1751 Josiah and his son Nathan settled on a farm of eighty acres on the north-western slope of Sagatal)scot Hill (now I'nion Hill), Worces- ter, Mass. Of this property they were joint owners. Much of the land remains in the hands of the family at this day.

Nathan* Perry, by occupation a farmer and weaver, was Treasurer of Worcester County fifteen years, also Town Treasurer most of the time, and for many years Notary Public. He was for twenty-three years deacon in the old South Church. A stanch patriot in trying times, he stood high in the confidence of his fellow-citizens. He died in February, 1806.
