These frontier villages in Northern Aroostook developed with wonderful rapidity after the treaty of 1S42 had terininateil the long contro- versy and established the boundary beyond dispute. Soon good schools were established, and, as the ])opulation rapidly increased liy the innnigration of sturdy settlers, a degree of culture obtained, rugged at first, of necessity, but based upon the honest {principle that in their isolated condition all ilmst work heartily tf)gether for the common weal.

In the public schools of the town Miss Ster- ling acquired the rudiments of a good English education, which was su{)plemente(l by a course of study in Houlton Academy, now Kicker Classical Institute. In July, 1865, she was united in marriage to Mr. \\'illiam Cole Spauld- ing, of Buckfield, Me., now one of the most prosperous merchants of Aroostook County. Mrs. SpauUling had two children, both worthy sons of a devoted mother. John Sterling vSpaulding, who, after coming to man's estate, entered into business witfi his father, passed to the higher life on December 15, 1896. The remaining son, Atwood William Spaulding, was military secretary, with the rank of Major, on the staff of Governor Powers. He is at the

present time in business with his father in Caribou.

In comparatively early life, when she w^as the centre of a beautiful and attractive home, with a devoted husband ever striving to pro- mote her wishes, and when two affectionate sons were in the most receptive years of child- hood and youth, Mrs. Spaulding became deeply interested in the aims ami purposes of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, be- coming a member in the early years of its his- tory. To the upbuilding of this organization and to the working out of its principles she has spared no reasonable effort. At home, abroad, in legislative halls, in church councils, and in social circles she has given voice to her sin- cerest convictions. Her abilities and thorough, conscientious integrity were early recognized in the v*^tate organization, where she has occu- pied responsil)le otlicial positions. Some of these she resigned upon the earnest solicitation of friends (who saw the need of her esi)ecia] services in the county), to accept in 1SS9 the county presidency, which honorable position she still holds.

Mrs. S]xuilding has taken an active part in all good works and never missed an op])ortunity to lend a helping hand to any unfortunate who comes within her notice. At home and within the thriving village of Caribou her most active work has been done, and here she is best loved and most appreciated. It was largely due to her efforts, aidetl by a few other public- spirited ladies of the town, that the town library was first established. This library, ' which was first maintained as a reading-room, soon outgrew its original resources, and was turned over to the town.

Mrs. Spaulding is also president of the Social Club of Caribou, organized in 1898, is an active member of the Literary Club, and is in close touch with all the agencies, charital)le and other- wise, for the im])rovement of the town and the best interests of its citizens. In religious mat- ters her affiliation is with the Episcopal church.
