Intensely loyal to the Grand Army of the R,epublic and pleased to note that all the corps in the department were working in harmony with their posts, she urged the making of greater efforts to assist them in the years to come.

At the reception given in Berkeley Temple at the close of her administration, February 14, 1900, her work was referretl to in compliment- ary terms by John E. Gilman, who that day retired from the ofhce of Department Com- mander, and by other prominent frientls. Mrs. Robinson subsequently resumed her active work for the local corps in Worcester, serving on the Relief Committee, of which she has been a member eighteen years.

During the years of the Spanish-American War she gave nearly six months of her time to the work of the Volunteer Aid Association. Major Edward T. Raymond, clerk of the Central District Court of Worcester, who was officially identified with the \'olunteer Aid Association work in that city, thus i-efers to her services: —

" Mrs. Angle Adele Robinson, of Worcester, was among the first to rally to the assistance of the sokliers of the late war with Spain and their families. Her work from May IS, 189S, to November 3, 1898, was having charge of the relief and relief workers established l)y the Worcester A'olunteer Aid Association. During the time she assisted some four hundred soldiers and their families. She worked early and late, and it was work of the most trying and nerve- exhausting kind. To answer the thousands of (luestions and endure at times the soinewhat ungracious remarks of those who were seeking

help fell to her lot. She solicited clothing of all kinds, and fitted out many soldiers' families. Only those who have pas,sed through a similar experience can understand what she passed through. Her work was p,erformed not for pecuniary reward, Mrs. Robinson having vol- unteered her services. The Executive Com- mittee of the Vohmteer Aid Association pa.ssed a vote comuientling her work and thanking her for her faithful attention to the suffering soldiers and their families."

By invitation of the Woman's Unitarian League of Worcester, Mrs. Robinson recently prepared and read a paper upon the \'ohmteer Aid work, which siie also read by request at Northboro, Mass., and also before the Ladies' Society of the Central Church. This paper, which is a record of experiences in a work that ^^ill always be memorable, she designated by the title "The Sununer's Campaign on the Home Side."

Mrs. Robinson is a meihber of the District Nurse Association of Worcester, also of the Woman's Employment Society, a charitable organization which assists women and children.

Mr. Freeman Brown, clerk of the Board of Overseers of the Poor of Worcester, pays the following tribute to her work of charity: —

" In the first place, Mrs. Robinson is a noble woman. By nature, by training, by environ- ment, by devotion to duty, by living for the benefit and comfort of others less fortunate than herself, she is a s])lenditl representative of true New England womanhood, the best in the world. Her work in the Woman's Relief Corps, both locally and in the State, is a matter of record, known throughout the country. It is a record of which every i-esident of Worces- ter is proud, and in thus honoring her city and her State she has brought honor upon herself. \A'ith the \'olunteer Aid Association during the Spanish- American War in 1898, Mrs. Robinson did grand service for the boys who fought under the stars and stripes. Her work in this con- nection, like that in the work in the Woman's Relief ("orps, is also a matter of record.
