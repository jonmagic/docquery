sponsibility: it not only necessitates the wise expenditure of thousands of dollars, but also a familiarity with pension laws, dealings with the office of the State Aid Commissioner, the Soldiers' Relief Bureau, visits to the sick, the transportation of needy veterans to various cities and towns and to Soldiers' Homes.

The relief work incident to the Spanish- American War has also received valuable aid from Mrs. Goodale. She is interested in the Daughters of the American Revolution, and was the first regent of the Sarah Bradlee Fulton Chapter, of Medford, serving two years. She is at present (1902) one of the Board of Direc- tors of the Medford Home for Aged Men and Women. She is an interesting and influential speaker, and has addressed many public gath- erings.

Mrs. Gootlale is prominent in the social and educational afl'airs of Medford. She was one of the earliest members of the Woman's Club of that city. In 1900 she was elected vice- president of the club, but resigned, as she went to Cuba in November of that year, remaining until April, 1901, at Columbia Barracks, Que- mados (eight miles from Havana), where her husband, who had enlisted to serve in the Spanish-American War, was stationed as As- sistant Brigade Quartermaster.

t GUISE HUMPHREY -SMITH.— The subject of this sketch was first __J known to the writer when she was not Mrs. Humphrey-Smith nor^ even Miss Humphrey, but simply and sweetly Louise. We were not reared in the same neighborhood, yet quite near each other; and as youth and maiden we formed a frientlship whicJi, through many years and many vicissitudes, has held fast till now, and which in some degree qualifies me to speak of her.

The town in which she was reared was Turner, Me. Her neighborhood was Bradfonl Village, through which flows the Nezinseot River. The village, a small and unpretentling farming com- munity, was large enough for a considerable circle of neighborly relations, and contained two men, a physician and a minister, of more than strictly local importance.

In the pulpit he was not eloquent, but he was wise, and in his pastoral walk he
