When Mrs. Barker, in 1884, retired from the office of President, her associates in the Depart- ment of Massachusetts presented to her an en- grossed testimonial as a mark of appreciation and esteem, saying in part: "The excellent judgment ever manifested during the two years in which you .servetl this department as Presi- dent, the fidelity with which you rendered service as first National President of the order, your influence, everywhere recognized, hare conferred honor upon our work, and aided in giving it a permanent endorsement by the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the land."

Mrs. Barker did not confine her interests entirely to Grand Army and Soldiers' Home work. She was one of the directors of the Union ex-Prisoners of War National Memorial Association, treasurer (and president one year) of the Woman's Club House Corporation of Boston, a trustee of the Maiden Hospital, and

a director of the Hospital Aid Association. She exerted an influence in public work and social life, and thoroughly enjoyed her asso- ciations in both.

In all her public work Mrs. Barker received the hearty co-operation of her husband, Thomas Erskine Barker. He was born in Canterbury, N.H., in 1839, and was educated in the public schools. He enlistetl in Company B, Goodwin Rifles, Second Regiment, New Hampshire Vol- unteers, May 31, 1861, and on the next day was made Captain. He was taken by the enemy at the first battle of Bull Run, and was con- fined in Libby Prison at Richmond, Va., and in Salisbury, N.C.

He engaged in the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, V'a., and was wounded in the latter conflict.

Soon after the battle of Gettysburg he re- turned to duty and was placed in command of the regiment. Colonel Barker was in the battle of Cold Harbor, in the series of engagements in front of Petersburg, where for twenty-two successive days he was under fire, and he was also present at the capture and occupation of Richmond. He was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel in October, 1864, ami Colonel in April, 1865. At the conclusion of hostilities he was placed in command of the United States forces at Danville, \ii., and, after a few weeks' ser- vice there as military governor, was ordered with the regiment to Concord, N.H., where it was mustered out of service.

For some years he was in the employ of a wholesale giocery firm in Boston. In 1872 he was admitted into partnership with Wadleigh, Spurr &amp; Co. 1880-88 he was a member of the firm of Andrews, Barker &amp; Bunton, and on June 1, 1889, he became one of the fiim of Barker &amp; Harris, brokers and commission mer- chants.
