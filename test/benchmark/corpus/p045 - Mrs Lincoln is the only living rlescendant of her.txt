Mrs. Lincoln is the only living rlescendant of her father's branch of the Burnham family. She has no children. After the death of her husband, in 1894, she established herself in Boston, where in a sunny study, surrounded by her books and an interesting collection of pictures and souvenirs of a recent summer in Europe, she sends forth her weekly words of culinary and household wisdom, gathered from a varied practical experience, to help her sister housekeepers.

Mrs. Lincoln says that she "cannot be a business woman and a society woman at the same time." She prefers an active, u.seful life, and believes that success lies in tloing one thing well. She is a member of the New England Women's Press A.ssociation, the Wheaton Semi- nary Club, the Charity Club, and the Cooking Teachers' League. Her greatest enjoyment is with her chosen circle of intimate friends, who often share the rest and quiet of her hospitable home.

An invitation from the publishers of the Scientific American, New York, to write the signed article on "Cookery" for their new En- cyclopedia Americana, is one of Mrs. Lincoln's latest honors.
