REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

by putting her fingers into my mouth. I then placed my tongue in the position for the sound of i in it, and let her find the point, as it lay perfectly still and soft in the bed of the jaw, just behind the lower front teeth, and discover that the teeth were slightly parted. After she had tlone this, I placed one of her forefingers upon my teeth antl the other upon my throat, or trachea, at the lowest point where it may be felt, and repeated the sound I several times. During this time Helen, standing in front of me in the attitude of one listening intently, gave the closest attention to every detail; and, when I ceased making the sound, her fingers flew to her own mouth and throat, and, after arranging her tongue and teeth, she uttered the sound i so nearly like that I had made, it seemed like an echo of it. When told she had given the sound correctly, she repeated it again and again. I next showed her, by means of her sensitive fingers, the depression through the centre of the tongue when in position for the sound of a and the opening between the teeth tluring the utterance of that sound. Again she waited with her fingers upon my teeth and throat until I sounded a several times, and then she gave the vowel fairly well. A little prac- tice enabled her to give it perfectly. We then repeated the sound of i and contrasted it with a. Having these two differing positions well fixed in her mind, I illustrated the position of the tongue and lips while sounding the vowel 0. She experimented with her own mouth, and soon produced a clear, well-defined o. After acquiring this she began to ask what the sounds represented, and if they were words. I then told her that i is one of the sounds of the letter i, that a is one of the sounds of the letter a, and that some letters have many different sountls, but that it would not be difficult for her to think of these sounds after she had learned to speak words. I next took the position for a, Helen following as before with her fingers, and, while sounding the vowel, .slowly closed my lips, producing the word " arm." Without hesi- tation she arranged her tongue, repeated the sounils, and was delighted to know that she had pronounced a word. Her teacher suggested to her that she should let me hear her say the words "mamma" and "papa," which she had

tried to speak before coming to me. She quickly and forcibly said, "nmm nmm" and

puj) pup

I commended her efforts, and

said that it would be better to speak very softly, and to sountl one part of the word longer than she did the other. I then illus- trated what I wanted her to understand, by pronouncing the word "mamma" very deli- cately, and at the same time drawing my finger along the back of her hand to show the relative length of the two syllables. After a few repeti- tions, the words "mamma" and "papa" came with almost musical sweetness from her lips.
