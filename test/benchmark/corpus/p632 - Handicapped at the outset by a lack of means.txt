Handicapped at the outset by a lack of means to pay for the training necessary to the most perfect voice and the added difficult}' of overcoming the prejudices of father and mother, not to mention other relations, who held certain rigid opinions about a public career, and that career the stage, for one of their own kin, Miss Quinlan at twenty-three years of age is a striking example of what may be accom- plished by determined effort o£ will. Having finally gained the reluctant consent of her parents, with her mind centred upon a certain goal, she entered the chorus of the Castle Square Opera Company, singing at the Castle Scjuare Theatre, Boston, in May, 1895. She remained there one year, entering into the hard work of learning the score of a new opera each week, and rehearsing one for the follow- ing week, while singing in two performances daily, with such courage and enthusiasm that

she was very often taken from the chorus and given some small part, only one or two lines, yet an honor for a girl not sixteen and with only a few months' experience.

In May, 1896, she accompanied the Castle Square Opera Company to Philadelphia, and sang with them at the Grand Opera House for a year and a half. While there she became understudy to Miss Clara Lane, and was often called upon to sing her rAles without so nuich as a rehearsal to give herself confidence.

Miss Quinlan's first appearance in New York was at the American Theatre, January 17, 1898. in "The Lily of Killarney," taking the part of Anne Shute. During the following summer she played one of the two principals in "Red, White, and Blue," a war drama, with Mr. Raymond Hitchcock, creating the character of Hetty Hall, a little American girl, the com- pany making a tour of the small cities around New York.

This was followed by "Shenandoah" at the Academy of Music, where she character- ized Junie Buckthorne, the General's daughter, until in the summer of 1901 she rejoined the Castle Square Opera Company at the Stude- baker Theatre in Chicago, 111. She sang in Chicago two seasons.

Miss Quinlan has sung in over one hundred and twenty-five operas, and has played all the principal soubrettc parts in the same. She made her first distinct success as Broni Slava in the "Beggar Student," and became an es- pecial favorite as Pitti Sing in the "Mikado" while in Chicago. She is also a piquant come- dienne, and with her pretty voice and pleasing stage manner has made astonishing progress toward marked fame since her appearance in the comic opera, "Tarantella," as Junie, in 1901.

• The next year she was given the part of Annette in the cast of "King Dodo," and dur- ing the season of 1902-1903 she pleased every one as Chiquita at the Tremont Theatre in Boston and Wallack's Theatre, New York.

She has always been under the management of the Castle Scjuare Opera Company, and has rendered them several important services, which naturally advanced her in their estima- tion and in her profession.
