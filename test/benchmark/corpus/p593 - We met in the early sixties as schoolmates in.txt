"We met in the early sixties, as schoolmates in the Shurtleff Grammar School, then, and for many years after, under the leadership of Miss Elizabeth G. Hoyt. How large a part this teacher had in the formation of the noble

character of her pupil cannot be estimated, but Miss Stone herself has often referred to the principles of truth, so firmly instilled by this faithful teacher, as the groundwork of all her her future usefulness. . . .

"As a school-girl, Ellen Stone was a leader. She had but one rival in the honor for the 'first seat' as the head of the class, when the monthly adding of the 'credits' by the pupils them.selves assigned positions. A favorite be- cause of her many lovable ((ualities, all rejoiced in her honors. These were the days of the Civil War, when patriotism ran high; and well miglit she, whose father and two brothers were at the front, lead her schoolmates in de- votion and loyalty to her country's flag. The day for her graduation was at hand. Ex- aminations had been passed with high per cent., and her part in the literary exercises was to declaim a patriotic poem by Elizabeth Browning: â€”

'Dead! both my boys! One of them shot by the sea in the East, One of them shot in the West by the sea.

Dead! both my boys! If in keeping the feast You want a great song for your Italy free, Let none look at me ! Let none look at me ! '

And then welled up the great heart of that Italian mother in such expressions of patriotism, beyond her grief, that none could read and not be stirred to the heart's depths. Ellen felt that the lofty thoughts were beyond her power to portray, but she accepted the trust; and those who heard her voice ring out over the multitude which filleil the old City Hall to the doors, can never forget the inspiration to loyalty in their own country's cause, received from the young declaimer.

" Her course through the high school was marked by the same devotion to duty, the same high ideals; yet so unassuming, so be- loved by all, she never seemed to realize that she was a marked scholar, the pride of her teachers and of the visiting school-board.

"Immediately upon her graduation she was installed as one of the teachers, iloing faithful work, until called to another position of honor and trust, as one of the assistant editors of the

Congregntionalist, with especial charge of the church news, children's department, poetry, and the missionary department. This edu- cation doubtless had much to do with her future leading, for it was not till long afterward, when she had really had her call to mission- ary work, and offered her services to the Board, that she knew her praying mother had con- secrated her to this work at her birth, and again at her baptism.
