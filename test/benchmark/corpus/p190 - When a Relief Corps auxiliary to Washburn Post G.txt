When a Relief Corps auxiliary to Washburn Post, G. A. R., was formed in Bradford, \'t., Mrs. Jones became a charter member, serving as President two years and holding some office ever since. The Department Convention of Vermont elected her successively Junior Vice- President, Senior Vice-President, and Presi- dent. She has served on important commit- tees in the State and national organizations, and has been active as a member of the Ander- sonville Prison Board of the National W. R. C. After doing effective work as Department Patriotic Instructor, she was appointetl a mem- ber of the first National Committee on Patriotic Instruction. She was National Junior Vice- President in 1899, and at the convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 1901, she was elected National President, receiving a unanimous vote. She performed the duties of this office in an admirable manner, and her address delivered in Washington, Otober 9, at the session of the Twentieth National Con- vention, was received with approval. A few extracts are here given: "The Twentieth Na- tional Convention marks the close of the sec- ond decade in the history of the Woman's Re- lief Corps. The history of the first decade

was OIK' largely cxpcriinciital and character- ized by most rayiul growtli in nunibpr.« and de- velopment. . . . Now we tind ourselves look- ing out over a field of work limitl»'ss in extent, and we find ourselves, too, most admirably prepared to carry forward the lines of work projected to reach, if possible, the highest ideal ever set for woman's work.

"This year, 1901-1002, has been a remark- ably successful one from every standpoint. . . . This has been brought about because the time was ripe, the officers of the administration wonderfully cajiable for the places they were called to fill; the spirit of the day was for pros- perity, for advancement.

" It is with feelings of great satisfaction that I am permitteil to tell you to-day that never were Memorial Sunday and Memorial Day more generally observed than in the year 1902.

"Contributions to the Southern Memorial Day fund came with much promptness from corps and also from indivitlual members, in many instances accompanied with letters filled with patriotic enthusiasm. There was in the hands of the national treasurer, from last year's contribution, nine hundred and forty-two dol- lars. This year we have .sent to the Quarter- master-general of the Grand Army one thou- sand six hundred and thirty-one dollars and ninety-three cents, and there is one hundred and thirty-three dollars and ninety-four cents now remaining in the treasury. . . . The amount sent South this year by the W. R. C. is the larg- est sum ever sent in any one year. We are most glad that the response was so generous, and we are positively assured by the com- mander-in-chief that the need was never greater nor the work of decorating more thoroughly performed. . . .

"We have formed a closer union with the G. A. R., to whom, as Colonel Bakewell says, ' the Woman's Relief Corps is married ' : and in that closer union of spirit and methods of work, in uniformity of pm'pose and material, we must hand to our posterity a heritage rich in the ideal teaching anil living of a higher citizenship than we have ever known.
