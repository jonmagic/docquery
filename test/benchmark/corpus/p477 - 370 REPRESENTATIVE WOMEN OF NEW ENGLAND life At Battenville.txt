life. At, Battenville the Anthony chiUh-en, two boys and four girls, were taught in a private school at home. At the age of fifteen Susan was a teacher in that school. At seventeen she taught in a family at Easton, N.Y., receiv- ing her hoard and one dollar per week. The next summer she taught a district school and "boarded round," her wages being a tlollar and a half ])er week. Following that, she attended successively a boarding-schoc)l. Miss Deborah Moul.son's, at Hamilton, near Philadelphia, ami a private school at home taught by Daniel Wright. Here ended, 1830, her school-da3's proper. From the first she had shown herself precociously intelligent, ambitious to learn, and fond of mastering difficult ))rolilenis.

The winter had brought business reverses to Mr. Anthony. With characteristic honesty he turned over his property to his creditors, reserving only the bare necessities allowed by law, and in March removed to Centre Falls, two Tuiles away. For some time after, Susan's energies were devoted to domestic concerns, such as washing, cooking, spinning, and weav- ing, with (piilting bees, apple bees, sleigh rides, and other rural diversions, not to mention eligible offers of marriage at this period and later on to keep life from being dull and pleas- ureless. Her next school was at New Rochelle, N.Y. For teaching a sunmier term of fifteen weeks she was jiaid thirty dollars.

The final migration of Daniel Anthony and his household, now depleted by the marriage of two daughters, was in 1845, the journey being made by railroad and canal to a farm three miles west of Rochester, N.Y. For three years from May, 1846, Susan was an assistant in the Canajoharie Academy, the principal of which, Daniel H. Hagar, failed not in after life to cx))ress high aj)preciation of her ability and services as a teacher. In 1850 and 1851 she was at home, managing the farm, her father attending to his business in Syracuse. After one more brief term of school, in the spring of 1852 she gave up teaching, to devote herself henceforth with singleness of purpose and rare continuity of effort to the stremions activities of her " fifty years of noble endeavor for the freedom of women," activities thus sununed up and circumstantially set forth in her
