MARIA MITCHELL, Ph.D., LL.D.— Maria Mitchell, astronomer of world- wide fame, discoverer of a comet in 1847, and for more than twenty years a member of the faculty of Vassar College, was a native of Nantucket. Born August 1, 1818, the third child of William and Lydia (Coleman) Mitchell, she grew to womanhootl in her island home, where she long remained an iidiabitant, on every clear evening repairing to the observatory on the roof of the house to sweep the heavens with a telescope.

On the paternal side she was grand-daughter of Peleg, Sr., and Lydia (Cartwright) Mitchell, and on the maternal side grand-daughter of Andrew Coleman, who was a great-grandson of John antl Joanna (Folger) Coleman. This remote ancestress, Joanna, was a daughter of Peter Folger and sister to Abiah Folger, who married Josiah Franklin and was the mother of the illustrious Benjamin Franklin. Peter Folger emigrated from Norwich, England, in the seventeenth century, and in 1663 settled in Nantucket, where he became a citizen of prominence, being a teacher, surveyor, clerk of the court and recorder, and "the scholar of the conununity."

Of Richard' Mitchell, who came from the Isle of Wight and was the progenitor of the Nantucket family of this name, Maria was a descendant in the sixth generation, the ances- tral line being: Richard,' who married Mary Wood; Richard,^ born in 1686, who married Elizabeth Tripj); Richard,^ who married Mary Starbuck; Peleg/ who married Lydia Cart- wright; and William,^ the father above men- tioned, who married Lydia Coleman.

\Mlliam Mitchell and his wife belongetl to the Society of Friends. Mr. Mitchell was a man of scholarly tastes and attainments, a teacher by profession, afterward cashier of a bank. He served as a member of the State Senate, as one of Governor Briggs's Council, and for a long time as one of the overseers of Harvard College. His favorite science was astronomy.

Maria Mitchell in her early years attended schools — first public and then private schools — taught successively by her father and the Rev. Cyrus Peirce, an educator of high repute, best

known in later days as the first principal of the first normal school in New England.

At the age of sixteen Miss Mitchell became assistant in Mr. Peirce's school in Nantucket. This was succeeded for a time by a private school of her own; and after that she served for nearly twenty years as librarian of the Nan- tucket Athenaeum, doing much to direct the taste in literature of the Nantucket youth of the period. She herself, as stated by her sister, Phebe Mitchell Kendall, compiler of her "Life, Letters, and Journals," which is the source of the information that follows, was an inveterate reader.

The original investigations in astronomy, pursued by her with ardor from girlhood up to the time of her professorship, had for their most notable result the discovery on October 1, 1847, of a telescopic comet. For this discovery she received in 1849 from King Frederic VH. of Denmark the gold medal which had been offered by his father, Frederic VL, in 1831. For nineteen years she acted as computer for the American Nautical Almanac. In 1865 she accepted the chair of astronomy at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., becom- ing also director of the oljservatory. From this time on until her resignation at Vassar in January, 1888, on account of failing health, she was an important factor in the movement for the higher education of women, a work into which "she threw herself, heart and soul," for its sake giving up " in a great measure her scientific life." Her father, with whom after her mother's death she had lived in Lynn, spent four happy years with her at Vas.sar, his death occuring in 1869. Although Professor Mitchell's resignation was not accepted, she declined the offer of a permanent home at Vassar, and returned to Lynn, where she died June 28, 1889.
