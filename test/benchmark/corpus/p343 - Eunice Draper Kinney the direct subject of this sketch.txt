Eunice Draper Kinney, the direct subject of this sketch, was born and passed her early years in a log cabin. Her educational opportunities were so limited that up to attaining the age of twenty-one she had attended school but two years and a half. On August 31, 1S71, she became the wife of JoJin Gartley, of Magagua- davic, York County, N.B., who died June 16, 1874, leaving no property. In alluding to her subsequent experiences Dr. Kinney says: "After the death of my first husband, my first start in life began at the time I picked a two-gallon pail

of wild strawberries, which I carried seven miles to the railroad station and sold for one dollar. With that sum I boarded the train for Bangor, Me., having no idea of the cost of travelling. When I told the conductor my destination, he demanded more fare; but I stated that my brother was in the employ of the road, and when I gave his name he knew him, and allowed me to pass to that city, where I obtained em- ployment as a general housework servant. As I was childless and so very young, I was ad- vised by my employers to resume my maiden name, which advice I followed and found de- cidedly to my advantage in after years. I then began to realize by comparison with others .how very ignorant I was, and, being resolved not to continue so, I devotetl all my spare moments to study, until, much to my surprise, I found my.self regarded as a woman of education. My medical education came about through force of circumstances, and not from any premeditation on my part."

Coming to Boston to prepare herself. Miss Draper entered the Boston Training School for Nurses at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and after pursuing the prescribed course was graduateil June 8, 1881. For some years she followed that profession in Boston, showing great efficiency.

On August 6, 1884, she married the Hon. John Mozart Kinney, a well-known citizen, who had been three times elected to the Massachu- setts House of Representatives and twice to the State Senate, besides having helil other import- ant offices, Init who lost his property through financial reverses. Dr. Kinney had completed her hospital service and was in college at the time of her second marriage, but continued her studies. This did not at first meet with the approval of Mr. Kinney, but before his death, which took place January 25, 1897, he learned to appreciate her attainments, and benefit from them. She obtained her medical degree April 16, 1890, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Boston, and has been a practising physician in Revere, Mass., during most of the time since, ^\'hile establishing a self-support- ing practice she engaged to some extent in literary work. In June, 1895, she was graduated from Tufts College Medical School,

Dr. Kinney has attained a higli standing in her profession; and her practice, which is in- creasing, yields her a hheral income. She says: "My work is very insjiiring to me. To stand face to face witli Deatii, and witii cool deter- mination to stand between him and his chosen victim, and come out the victor, brings its own reward, and does not become tiresome or mo- notonous."
