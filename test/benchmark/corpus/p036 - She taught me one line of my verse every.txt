She taught me one line of my verse every day, and then had me repeat the whole verse till I could say it perfectly. Of my mother's an- cestry I know but little. They were of Scotch descent, and many of them in the Revolution- ary W'ar."

While living in Gardiner, Me., Reuben M. .Smiley was warden of the Episcopal church and leader of the choir. He was one of the or- ganizers of the Sons of Temperance in Maine. His daughter Lura attended the Gardiner pub- lic schools until she was twelve years old, then was sent to a private school or academy in Gardiner called the "Lyceum." When only six years old, .she signed the pledge at a tem- perance meeting in the Methodist Kpiscopal church in Gardiner, Me., and two years later she joined the "Cold W'ater Army," which was then popular throughout the country. In 1846, the family having removed that year to Lowell, Mass., where her father was engaged in putting turbine wheels into the mills, she there joined the Daughters of Temperance, and, although so very young, was chosen chaplain of the L'nion. This society was afterward merged in the Sons of Temperance. She has held an unbroken membership for fifty-six years, and is now (1903) Grand Worthy Patri- arch of the Grand Division of Maine.

In 1849 she joined the Baptist church in Lowell, of which the Rev. Daniel C. Eddy was pastor. In 1851 her parents moved to Port- land, Me. This city she has ever since called her* home, although temporarily residing in New York and other cities.

On March 7, 1853, she married Jo.«eph Part- ington, a native of Islington Parish, London. Born August 9, 1831, he came to this covmtry when seven years old, and settled in New York, but moved to Portland in 1851.

This regiment having completed the nine months' service for which it enlisted, Mr. Partington again joine'd the army, this time with a three years' regiment, the Thirtieth Maine, which was commanded by the same colonel, who afterward became a prominent general.

Mrs. Partington also joined that church after their marriage, and she retains her membership therein.

In the spring of 1S61 Mrs. Partington united with the Intlependent Order of Good Templars, joining Arcana I&gt;odge, of Portland, the first lodge organized in the vState.
