AVhile attending to an ever-increasing prac- tice, Miss Benneson has been a constant student. Her contributions to literature on questions concerning government are of recognized value. A paper upon " Executive Discretion in the United States," read before the American Asso- ciation for the Advancement of Science in 1898, attracted wide attention. That was followed by one upon " Federal Guarantees for Main- taining Republican Government in the States." The Popular Science Monthly in speaking of this paper said: "No more suggestive title has ever been presented to such a body." In rec- ognition of valuable papers contributed, Miss Benneson was made a fellow of the Association in 1899, and in 1900 was elected secretary of the Social and Economic Science Section. An- other paper on "The Power of our Courts to interpret the Constitution," also read before the Association, has led to the announcement of a book dealing with the same general subject. Aside from these, articles from her pen have frequently appeared in various magazines. At the First International Council of Women, held at Washington, D.C., 1888, she read a paper on "College Fellowships for Women," which has had much influence in increasing their oppor- tunities for original research. In June, 1899, she gave the Alumni Poem at the University of

Notwithstaiidiiif:; lici- professional duties and her student life, Miss liennesou has not been indifferent to any luuuan interest. She has been a keen observer of all the activities of women, has l)een (juick to deplore any ti'tidency that would destroy womanliness in the hifjhest sense and as ready to aid any movement that would give women a fuller and richer life and make tliem more efficient members of society.

"The cominfi; woman, " writes Miss Henneson, "will not hesitate to do whatever she feels will benefit humanity, and she will develop her own faculties to the utmost because by .so diiing she can best .■^erve. t-he will have a home, of cour.se. She will not marry, however, for the sake of a home, because she will be seli-supporting. The home she will liel|) to found will not be for the .selfish gratihcation of two individuals, but a centre of light and harmony to all that come within the sphere of its radiance. Many so- called duties, that drain the nerve force of the modern woman, the coming woman will omit or delegate. One duty she will not delegate — the character moulding of her children. The woman of the future comes not to destroy, but to fulfil the law. She will not confine her in- fluence to a limited circle. It will be felt in the nation's housekeeping. AAherever she is needed there will she be found."

Miss BennesOn believes that reforms cannot be forced upon society, but must come through a natural evolution, and that one can do an- other no more serious injury than to deprive him of lifjerty of ojiinion and action. Hence she is never dogmatic or aggressive. Her rule of conduct, though i)erhaps not .so formulated, seems to be "to study hard, think (juietly, talk gently, act frankly, await occasions, hurry never." From her earliest years her life has been characterizeil by calmness and delibera- tion. She carries the burdens of others easily, and seems to have none of her own.
