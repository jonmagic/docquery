ANNIE COOLIDGE RUST was born in / \ Richmond, Va., one of a family of X jL nine children. Her father, Thomas Adams Rust, a very successful hard- ware merchant in Richmond, was a native of Salem, Mass. His wife, Miss Rust's mother, in maidenhood Phoebe Cutler Chamberlain, was born in New Hampshire, but had removed to Boston with her parents when she was a child. She was well educated and very ac- tive in church affairs in Boston, being a mem-

ber of the palish of the Rev. Robert C. Waters- ton, by whom their marriage ceremony was performed in 18 â€” .

Richmond in those days seemed a long dis- tance for the bride to be going from her home and mother, and it was agreed by the husband that a part of each year should be passed in "dear old Boston." The house in which they lived in Richmond, and in which Mi.ss Rust was born, was a typical Southern house of many large rooms, the servants' quarters and kitchen being in a separate building. In this Southern home many Boston friends, also frientls and business associates from England, were hospitably entertained.

While their chiklren were still young, Mr. and Mrs. Rust, being anxious that they should have the best educational advantages, removed to Cambridge, Mass., and, after some of the chil- dren were graduated from the Cambridge schools, the family removed to Boston. The mother believed that it would be of great advantage to every young woman to have a knowledge of the Froebelian jjrinciples of education, known as the Kindergarten System, which applies to the life of the little child, but knew not of any such school in this vicinity. While visiting a friend in Cambridge one day. the conversa- tion turned upon a " play school" that had been opened in Boston, where the children had no books. The term "play school" interested the mother. She looked into the matter, and learned that the name was given in irony by those who did not know what it was. To her great delight, it was a Kinilergarten antl Normal Class, which Madame Kreige and her tlaughter, Alma Kreige, from Berlin, had opened in Bos- ton, they having been requested by their teacher, Baroness von Marenholtz Bulow, to come to America and introduce this system of etluca- tion. Mrs. Rust was much pleased to find just what she hafl been looking for, and at her earnest rei [uest her daughter entered the school as a pupil in one of the first Normal Classes. Mi.ss Rust brought to this work, besides an aj:)titude for it and the enthusiasm of youth, rare insight into child nature, a cultivated mind, and deep religious feeling. Moreover, ideas gained from conversations with her teacher were so unlike those by which she had been governed
