School for Boys, also for addresses in the inter- est of a reformatory prison for women and in the cause of equal suffrage. Her presentation of these subjects has been remarkable for fore- sight and sound reason, with an earnestness and womanly grace which appealed to both the minds and hearts of her hearers. Though ac- tively itlentified with so many public interests in her native city and State, she has always consistently maintained that a woman's first duty was to her home, and she has never alloweil anything to interfere with her family and social relations. The generous hospitality of Mrs. Hunt and of her husband, in his lifetime, has long made her home a centre of attraction to kinsfolk, friends, and distinguished guests Mr. Hunt died in 1S96. Their two sons are living, one in Portland, the other in Minne- apolis.

LELIA FRANCES BASSETT ROCK- WOOD, Department Patriotic Instruc- J tor of the Woman's Relief Corps of Massachusetts, was*born November 4, 1843, in Little Falls, N.J. She is descended on her father's side from William Bassett, who came to Plymouth in the second forefather ship, the "Fortune," in 1621. Joseph Bassett, her great-grandfather, was a Revolutionary soldier. (His record can be found in " Massachasetts Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolu- tion," vol. i., p. 760, Captain John Callender's Company.)

Nathaniel Bowman Brown Bassett, her father, was born October 19, 1814, in Plymouth, Vt., and died July 10, 1866, in Milford, Mass. He was a teacher in Albany and .several other places in New York and in New Jersey, but failing health compelled him to give up the profession which he had followed with success for many years.

Mrs. Rockwood's mother, Caroline Fisher Ba.ssett, daughter of Benjamin Fisher, was born in West Fairlee, Vt., and died in Milford, Mass., July 29, 1899. She was descended from An- thony Fi.sher, an Engli.sh Puritan, who settled in Dedham, Massachusetts Bay Colony, in 1637.

Lelia Frances Bassett (Mrs. Rockwood) at-

tended the public schools of Milford until she reached the age of fourteen, and subsequently for several years pursued a regular cour.se of study under the instruction of her father, who was then a confirmed invalid. She began to teach in Milfonl when she was eighteen years of age, and continued in this work until June, 1876. The school committee in their report for that year referred to her as follows : " We have few changes to report. One of them is the resignation of Miss Lelia F. Bassett. For years she taught the primary school in the upper room of the old Town House. Under her care it grew to be a model .school, excelling in gooil order and in rapid advance of the pujMls in study. She possessed superior gifts as a teacher, and in her resignation the town has met a loss not easy to repair. But what is our loss is another's gain. As Mrs. Rock- wood she carries with her the good wishes of hundreds of parents who had learned to es- teem her as the kind and judicious teacher of their children."
