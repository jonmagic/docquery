Miss Foster's school-days were spent in Lowell, Mass., where she was graduated from the high school. She afterward studied at the Berlitz School of Languages, and spent sev- eral years in the study of art and outdoor sketching.

In her teens she sent sonnets to the Boston Transcrijit and afterward to various magazines, contributing short stories to the Youth's Com- panion. In 1896 she assumed the duties of assistant editor of The Household, eventually becoming its editor. In 1900 she assumed her present duties on the Youth's Companion.

Her first book, "Hortense, a Difficult Child," was published by Lee &amp; Shepard in 1902. This book had an immediate sale, and before six months had been .sent to European countries and the Hawaiian Islands.

Miss Foster's home is now at Annisipiam, Mass. She leads a very quiet and retired life, and is not a member of any club.
