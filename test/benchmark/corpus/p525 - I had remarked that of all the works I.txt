"I had remarked that, of all the works I saw, few were written by Americans and none by women. Here was a work the most fasci- nating I had ever read, always excepting ' Pil- grim's Progress,' written by a woman. How happy it made me! The wish to promote the reputation of my own sex and do something for. my own country was among the earliest mental emotions I can recollect. These feelings have had a.salutary influence bydirectinginy tlioughts to a definite object: my literary pursuits have had an aim beyond se]f-.seeking of any kind."

A woman of original ideas and forceful will, Mrs. Hale in her day, the middle ([uarters of the nineteenth century, took the initiative in various public movements of patriotic, ])hil- anthropic, or religious nature. In Philadelphia, whither she removed from Boston in 1841, and where she died on April 30, 1879, she founded the Ladies' Medical Missionary Society of that city, and also the Seamen's Ai&lt;l Society, of which she was the first president. She is cred- ited with having been the first to suggest and to advocate (which she did for twenty years) the setting apart annually of the last Thursday in November as a day of national thanks- giving, President Lincoln being the first to adopt the suggestion by d(&gt;sigiiating this date in his national Thanksgiving proclamation.

American patriots of to-tiay may well bear gratefully in mind the zeal and eflSciency with which Mrs. Sarah Josepha Hale more than half a century ago jjromoted the completion of the granite obelisk that perpetuates the memory of the battle of Bunker Hill. It is a page of almost forgotten history. A few years after the laying of the corner-stone of the monument, which took place on June 17, 1825, the funds of the Monument Association had all been expended, and the shaft had risen only to the height of forty feet. In January, 1830, as narrated in Professor Packard's brief history of the work, the directors received anil accepted from Mrs. Hale a "pi-oposition to raise funds for its con- tinuance by an appeal to the ladies of New England." The efforts of the ladies at this time resulted in the contribution of less than two thousand dollars, by 18,34 amounting to nearly three thousand dollars. Other sums were received, and the structure grew to the height of eighty feet. In the report of the as.so- ciation in June, 1840, "doubt was expressed whether the j)resent generation would witness the completion of the monument. ... In a sewing-circle of Boston several ladies proposed the idea of a fair in its behalf."

Under the management of a committee con- sisting of Mrs. Sarah J. Hale, Mrs. William H. PresQott, and other ladies of Boston, the fail- was held in t^uincy Hall in September, 1840, and continueil seven days. A paper called The Monument, edited by Mrs. Hale, was printed daily in the fair building. The fair was admirably conducted. The proceeds, amounting to thirty thousand dollars, with twenty-five thousand dollars from other sources, afforded th(&gt; means for completing the monu- ment.
