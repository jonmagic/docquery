Mrs. Cobb's life was spent in work for the public welfare. She was a frequent contribu- tor to the religious press, and was a great fa- vorite with the Sunday-schools, which she ad- dressed with a heart filled with love for children and a mind stored with all that interests them.

She was also equally interesting to the adult listener. Every word told. Her utterance was very distinct, her voice full, meloilious, and far- reaching, not only into space, but into the hearts and souls of her audience. She loved humanity, and her eloquence was as the elo- quence of a mother talking to a fondly listen- ing family of children; in sliort, it was of the kind with which Abraham Lincoln moved and controlled his autlience. Without any mani- festation of con.sciousness that she knew more than her auditors, she kept them on a level with her best, her highest, and her deepest thought. She riveted attention the instant her voice was heard. All felt as if they were individually addressed, and each gave ear to her words accordingly.

Mrs. Cobb, in her motherly way, once wrote a letter to Queen Victoria, congratiilating her on the birth of her third child, a letter so hap- pily worded, .so sympathetic and sincere, that it touched the royal heart, and was cordiaiiy acknowledged.

She attended, by invitation, the first Woman's Rights Con- vention held in this State â€” at Worcester. She was greatly amused by the climax of an elo- quent appeal of a somewhat aged colored woman, who, in the midst of a fervid harangue, cried out as only one of her race could, " Why, sisters, if I am what I am without an ctlicashun, what on arth would I be with one?"

Mrs. Cobb was widely known as a comforter of the sick, the dying, and the bereaved. She ever lived consciously with God, and those she visited in the hour of trial and sorrow ever felt through her liis i)resence. Her obituary poems were the source of much solace: many were the aching hearts that were soothed by her heaven- inspired lines. There were those without num- ber who might well ask, after a consoling visit from her or a word from her pen, "0 death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy vic- tory?" She walked with Jesus, and it would seem at times as if she must have felt his hand in hers.
