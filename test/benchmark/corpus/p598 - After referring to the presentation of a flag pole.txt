After referring to the presentation of a flag- pole worth one hundred and forty dollars by Colony Corps and C'omrades of Fitzgerald, Ga., the gift of a flag from the Ex-prisoners of War Association of Comiecticut, the furnishing in oak of the guest chamber at the cottage by members of corps in Massachusetts, and a do- nation of one hvmdred dollars raised through the efforts of Mrs. Emma R. Wallace, of Illi- nois, a member of the board, Mrs. Turner stated that not one cent had been taken from the

national treasury for all the work accomplished at Andersonville. She recommended that one thousand dollars be donated from the general fun&lt;l and placed in the Andersonville Prison Fund for the use of the board in completing the work mentioned in the report. Previous to the adoption of this recommendation, all the work had been conducted by voluntary contribution.

Mrs. Turner entered into this work with great enthusiasm. In her report at the convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 1901, she said: "Within the last two years over two hun- dred pecan trees have been set out, and they are growing finely. The pecan industry of Georgia will be a close rival to the orange trade of Florida and, I believe, with better results, as we have no fear of frosts. I firmly believe the place can be made more than self-supporting by planting the ground with pecan trees. Ohio and Massachusetts will this fall put up hand- some monuments of granite inside the stockade grounds, in honor of their loyal sons who died as prisoners of war. Pennsylvania has made an appropriation for a monument, and other States are agitating the matter.

"The most important work of the past year has been the erection of the pavilion over Provi- dence Spring and its dedication."

In addition to her efforts for the improvements at Andersonville, Mrs. Turner performed the duties of National Counsellor from September, 1900, to September, 1901.

The movement in behalf of a Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts enlisted her sympathies, and she was one of the leaders in the bazaar held for that object in Mechanics' Building, Boston, in December, 1881. One of the attractions of the bazaar was a military album, containing autographs of President Lincoln and the orig- inal war Cabinet, besides the signatures of prominent generals and other leaders in the civil conflict and in the Revolution. It netted one thousand dollars to the fund, and is now treasured in the library of the Loyal Legion of Massachu,setts. The autographs were collected and arranged by Mrs. Turner.

She is one of the founders of the Ladies' Aid Association of the Soldiers' Home, auxil- iary to the Board of Trustees, and is a regu-

lar contributor to the home, which she often visits. She has served continuously in some official capacity â€” as chairman of large com- mittees for fairs, Memorial Day and other special work, as a member of the Board of Di- rectors, and as one of the Mce-Presidents. A room bearing her name has been furnished by the Department of Massachusetts, W. R. C, and contains her portrait.
