Her soft, brilliant, blue-gray eyes, with pujjils so dilating as to make them appear black, the bright glow of her cheeks, the well- set head, and distinction in carriage, all ex- pressed the blending of ilignity, force, anil ten- derness in her character."

MARION A. M.\cBRIDE, journalist, widely known through the country for her work in the field of tlomestic science and for her [ihilanthropic efforts in connection with the Woman's Chris- tian Temperance Union, is a native of East- hampton, Mass. Her ancestors, the Snows and W-arners, have lived in Williamsl)urg, Mass., since 1731. Solomon Snow and Jonathan War- ner responded to the Lexington alarm of April 19, 1775, marching from Hamp.shire County to the defence of the country.

Mrs. MacBride was educated in New York, but her home for the greater part of her life has been in Boston. Her first newspaper work was done for the Neiv York Tribune in 1881, and sinco that time her name has been prominent in the field of journalism. From 1881 to 1885 she was a reporter antl correspondent of the Bo&gt;&gt;ton Post, but for the j^ast fifteen years .she has given more time to magazine work. A reg- ular contributor to the colunms of the Boston Daily Globe, New York Herald, Nexv Orleans Picayune, Cleveland Plain Dealer, and St. Louis Chronicle, she has also conducted a department in the American Art Magazine, has written arti- cles for ih^Decorator and Furnisher, and has filled important jjositions on the leading period- icals devoted to domestic science.

Mrs. MacBride is noted for her ability as an organizer. At the Cotton Centennial Exposi- tion in 1885 she organized the National Woman's

Press Association, which became international in 1887. The Woman's Press Association of Ohio, the Southern Woman's Press Association, and the New p]ngland Woman's Press As.socia- tion were all called into existence largely through her personal efforts.

Mrs. MacBride organized the first woman's tlejmrtment of the New England Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute Fair held in Boston early in the eighties, and was also organizer and first superintendent of the woman's depart- ment of the Massacluisetts Charitable Mechanic A.ssociation.
