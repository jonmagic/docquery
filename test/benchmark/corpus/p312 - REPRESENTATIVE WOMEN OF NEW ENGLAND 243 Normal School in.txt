Normal School in 1883, and was graduated in 1885.

Miss Dixon was now eighteen years old, holding a teacher's diploma and waiting for a position. She was asked to teach the pri- mary department in lirewster, Mass., which she did .successfully for a year. Then followetl two years' work in the intermediate grade at Cotuit. At the enil of this period her former teacher secured for her a position in one of the Brockton schools, and in that city she spent two j'ears. It was while in l^rockton that Miss Dixon decided to study for the ministry. She determined to prepai'e herself for the career of an efficient worker. With this end in view she entered in the fall of ISOO the College of Liberal Arts of Boston University. She laugh- ingly told her friends that she intended to take seven years of college and theological work, that she had poor preparation, poor health, one hundred and fifty dollars, and a conviction that it was the right thing to do. This convic- tion made it possible for her to accomplish the task. The second year was the hardest: her money was expended, and she was obliged to do some work outsitle of her college cour.se. During all of this year .she taught an evening school three nights each week, and every Wetlnesday taught as a substitute in the Ham- mond Street Granmiar School. This left but three evenings and four days a week for all of her college work. At the end of the year Miss Dixon's health failed, and .she was obliged to lie in one of the Boston hospitals foi- sixteen weeks. The next year, through the kindness of friends and her physician, she was enabled to pursue her studies without doing extra work, and was graduated, taking the degree of Bachelor of Phild.soph}-. The following September she entered the Theological School of Boston University, and was the only woman in the school eligible to a divinity degree. During her course here an opportimity came to her to supply the pulpit of the Methodist Church at Centreville, Ma,ss. This village on Cape Cod is five miles from Barnstable, her native place, and seventy-five miles from Bos- ton, where she was at school. I''or two years she travelled this distance every wt'ck, iireach- ing on Sundays and taking full charge of the

work. She was not allowed to be called the pastor, as the Methodisti^ do not grant licenses to women to preach; but the people wanted her, and so she was allowed to do the work, the presiding elder t)f the district being nomi- nally the pastor.

Miss Dixon was graduated from the Theo- logical School early in June, 1S97, taking the degree of Bachelor of Sacred Tlieology and ranking among the first in her class. Dur- ing the last few months of her coiu'se she had supplied the pulpit of the Congregational Church at Tyngsborough, Mass. She now re- ceived a unanimous call from this church to become its .settled pastor.
