"While travelling through Ireland, I stopped at a little whitewashed cottage, and asked if the woman living there could give me a supper of bread and milk. The woman replied, 'Walk in and sit down in j'our own place.' As I en- tered, I noticed in the centre of the room a large pine table, around which the family had gathered. The only chairs at the table were the ones occupied by the father and mother. The three elder children were seated upon stools, while the two younger were standing. Yet at the table was an empty stool, and before it a plate turned down. That was what the. woman had calletl my 'own place.' I asked her why she had called it my place. She re- plied, 'We have a little superstition that, if

Although upon this occasion an in- valid, seeking rest, she managed during her nine days' visit to address with great accept- ance nineteen meetings, and left with the cry ringing in her ears, ' Will 3'e no' come back again?'" The Dundee Courier reported her lectures, and added: "Dundee is enjoying a rich treat in listening to the stirring addresses of Mrs. Partington, of Portland, United States. The enthusiasm with which she is everywhere received increa,ses nightly. . . . Her whole heart is in the work." The Londonderry (Ireland) Neivs and the Ballymena (Ireland) Advertiser referred in complimentary terms to her work, the editor of the latter stating that he had never heard " better argument or more con- vincing and eloquent advocacy of any cause."

Upon returning again to America, Mrs. Part- ington travelled in twenty-two States, giving lectures from Maine to California. The Balti- more American said of her: "One of the largest and most enthusiastic temperance meetings ever held in this city was conducted by Mrs.
