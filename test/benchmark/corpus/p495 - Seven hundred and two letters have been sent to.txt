"Seven hundred and two letters have been sent to these women. Seventy-eight girls have been sent to home and friends, five sent to hospitals, and two to the Home of the Good Samaritan.

" ^^'hen it is considered what a large amount of investigation is required to enable the agent to deal intelligently and fairly with the gi'eat number of cases constantly demanding attention, besides the clerical work of the office, I find that the days are not long enough to accomplish all I would wish.

"To lift fallen womanhood out of the slough of despair, and lead her to a realizing sense that she possesses within herself the elements of a nobler life, is to accomplish much in this field of labor. This point once reached, to perfect the rest is only needed the helping hand which will aid her to become self-support- ing. It is impossible to sum up the results of the work. However, this comforting thought comes to me: 'Daughter, be not dismayed by the painful labors which thou hast undertaken for me, but let my promise strengthen and comfort thee in all events.' "

Extracts from the last report given by Miss Rii.ssell, under date October 1, 1902, also show the spirit, untiring zeal, and success with which she labors: —

This assistance the State has generously given to the cause of humanity, antl for liumanity's sake the Re- deemer suffered.

"As to the desired end, there is, among civilized ])eople in a Christian lantl, no chance for controversy: the only possible contention is, how that end may best be attained.

"There are women to whom imprisonment has meant something, who if they have sinned have also suffered, who.se repentance is sincere, and who desire to live l)lamelessly in the future. Of this class 1 recall sixty-seven cases. This number may appear small, but the future of every one of these was in peril; and who shall jjlace a value upon a human soul? It was the one lost sheep, and not the ninety and nine safely within the fold, for which the Shepherd concerned himself. I recall three instances of the power of divine Love. One case was that of a girl who came to me a year ago, somewhat under the influence of liquor, and asked me to save her from her friends. I took her to a place of safety, where I could watch over her, and in due course of time sent her to a Christian home in Kansas, where she is making for herself a name above reproach.
