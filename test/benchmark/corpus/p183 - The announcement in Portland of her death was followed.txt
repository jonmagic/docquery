The announcement in Portland of her death was followed by a remarkable manifestation of

sorrow in the newspapers, and in the clubs of which she was a member, as well as in her family and among her every-flay friends. A wide- spread desire was expressed for a suitable memorial of her beneficent life; and, under the leadership of the club women of Portland, action was at once taken for its fulfilment. Nowhere, it was felt, could a more fitting place be found than at the Temporary Home, Mrs. Brown's favorite charity; accordingly, within a few months a nursery was erected there, to bear her name. On one of its walls is fixed a tablet with the inscription : —
