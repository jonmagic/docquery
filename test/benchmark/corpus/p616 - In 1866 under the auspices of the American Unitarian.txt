In 1866, under the auspices of the American Unitarian Association, Miss Bradley went to Wilmington, N.C., to teach jioor white children. The following is from an account of her work

published shortly after her death, which oc- curred in January, 1904: â€”

She opened her school on January 9, 1867, in a very small building, and within a week had sixty-seven pupils. The condition of some of these was deplorable. Miss Bradley hafl liter- ally to feet! the hungry and clothe the poor before she could minister to their spiritual and mental necessities, meanwhile establishing a Sunday .service in which .she was teacher, super- intendent, antl preacher. The school rapidly increased under her fostering care, and was soon placed upon a firm basis. Through the generosity of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, who had been interested in the undertaking from the first, the field of usefulness was greatly enlarged. The corner-stone of a new building was laid in 1871, and in 1872 the large, well-equipped Tiles- ton School was opened to the public, the first free public school in Wilmington. Trained teachers were brought from the North, and so numerous were the applications for admittance to the school that many had to be turned away; but it was never the poor who were rejected. . . . In five years the school had grown from a small roomful of timid, half-suspicious, hungering souls into a large, crowded school of ten or twelve rooms, with all the modern etlucational appliances, for which Mrs. Hemenway had assumed the financial responsibility.

"Miss Bradley, in spite of delicate health, continued her work until the summer of 1891. Three generations have arisen to call her blessed. She was the friend, adviser, and helper of all, in matters physical as well as spiritual. That she was endowed with the sterling qualities we are wont to claim for our New England ancestors goes without .saying. . . . She was an ardent Unitarian, and welcomed warmly the transient few who strayed into the city. With quaint humor she would say, 'Ah, now you have doubled the number of Unitarians in Wilmington.' Miss Bradley died in the little brown cottage in the school grounds, which had so long been her home. The announce- ment of her death was received in Wilmington with reverent sorrow. . . .

" The body lay in state all day Sunday, Jan- uary 17. The editor of the Dispatch, of Wil- mington, thus spoke of her: 'She was one of

Wilmington's foremost citizens, and the magni- tude of her work stands out to-day as an ever- lasting monument. Miss Bradley was the mother of public school education in Wilming- ton. . . . Year by year her influence grew, and the aim of her life grailually rounded into success. The seed she planted over a quarter of a century ago grew and developed into one of the finest public school systems in the coun- try. Her name will ever be held in highest reverence in this community.'"
