To her wedded life Almeda brouglit all the innate Pilgrim reverence for holy marriage and for divinity, developing more and more with the sacred cares of maternity. The diary of her wifehood, dating from her wedding

tlay, May 1, 1856, is like a sacred poem, a latter- day song of Ruth, in its spirit and diction. Brought immediately, in the household and church of her husbantl's parents, Sylvanus and Eunice Cobb, into contact with noble men and women identified with the great temperance and anti-slavery reforms, her soul was quick- ened with desire to serve humankind as they were serving it. Yet her wifely and motherly devotion taxed her time, and only by the pages of her diary is the inmost secret of her real character revealed.

Three years after her marriage she writes: " How swiftly the time glides by, employed as I am at present with my two little ones and other domestic cares! for the happiest home has these cares if well conducted.- Indeed, I can no more be happy if these little duties are neglected. I confess they sometimes press heavily upon me, and I feel that I would fain fly off from them a while and refresh my weary spirit by communion Avith the gifted spirits whose works lie thick around me; for, simple though our home is in its outward adornings, we have plenty of good books here. But I look forward to the time when these little ones will not require quite so close attention from me. There is so much I want to do, for myself, my family, and for everybody, all over this great and good world."

And again, later: "Thoughts I hav.e that thrill my soul and make me better each hour I live, thoughts born of deep life experiences made blessed teachers by trust in God, thoughts that might shed light on the pathway of many a weary, sin-sick pilgrim ; and yet nmst I keep them, for my time, if it cometh ever, is not yet come. Yet, if it be best so, then I know the Father will j'et unseal tliese mute lips and give f)ower to this dumb tongue. And, if it be better so, let me be yet as now. Only teach me thy will, my Father, and I am content. Let my work be what and where it may: if I may only add to thy truth and power in the earth, I will be happy in doing it, and count myself, even though my sphere be limited, one of thy meek and lowly apostles, ever striving to lead others in the ' pleasant paths,' if I can in no other way, by a pure and spotless life.

"But I humbly, earnestly pray for a wider sphere of usefuhiess. Darkness and error pre- vail on every hand. I would fain have power to clear away some of these clouds. And shall I pray in \ain? We have the promise â€” if we seek, we shall find."
