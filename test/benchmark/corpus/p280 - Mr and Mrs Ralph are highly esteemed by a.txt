ELLEN A. RICHARDSON, artist, was born in Portsmouth, N.H., being a daughter of Oren Bragdon and his wife, Anna H. W. Bragdon. We are told that the first Bragdons in New Eng- land came over from England in their own vessels about the middle of the seventeenth century, .sailed up York River, and took up their abode in the town of York, Me. Some of the land of which they became the owners has never passed out of the possession of the family, and it is said to be a matter of record that no year has elapsed in which some Bragdon has not been serving the town in public office.

Mrs. Richardson is the wife of A. Maynard Richardson, of Boston. She was educated in public and private schools of Portsmouth, N.H., and the academy at Fryeburg, Me., pur- suing special studies in art, in which she made

great progress. After her marriage her hfe for many years was devoted chiefly to her family, the pursuit of art, however, absorbing mufh of her leisure. She was equally at home in the handling of oils, water-colors, i)astels, and charcoal, engaging also in etching and the decoration of porcelain and clay under the glaze. Her proficiency in the last nametl line of work became such that in 1893 she re- ceived an appointment to serve at the Colum- bian Exposition in Chicago on the Board of Awarils, in the Department of Manufactures from Clay, antl at the close of the fair was ap- pointed to prepare the official report of the potteries exhibit. In 1895 she was appointed to serve on the Jury of Awards in a similar position at the Atlanta Cotton States Inter- national Exposition. Also she was the only woman to sit with the Higher Boartl of Awards which held its sessions in the Smithsonian Institute at ^^'ashington.

Her ability to organize and conduct affairs of magnitude won a .series of successes in popu- lar and scientific lecture courses and depart- mental attractions during several successive seasons of the expositions in Boston of the Massachusetts Charitalile Mechanic As.socia- tion and in the home congresses hekl in Boston in 1896 and 1897.

Appointed during her connection with the Columbian Exposition as Massachusetts State President of the National Business League, Mrs. Richardson founded a State branch thereof. As President' of the Massachusetts Floral Em- blem Society, she inaugurated the work of that society also, and developed it in a most diver- sifietl manner, resulting in the adoption by the Society, January 1, 1903, of the Mountain Laurel as the State flower.
