On her mother's side Mrs. Morey is a descend- ant of Colonel Thomas Johnson, of Newbury, Vt., who .served in the war of the Revolution, and who was in official correspondence with General Washington, autograph letters from whom are still preservetl in the family.

Very early in life Ellen Beale manifested that power and individuality of thought which led her to differ materially with her family and teachers in matters of opinion and practice. Born into a pro-slavery family who had, in earlier times, been slave-holders, she espoused the anti-slavery cause at a time when it meant disgrace and ostracism to do so. When a mere child, she evinced that passion for music which has been the dominating influence in her life, playing from memory at four years of age selec- tions from the gr(&gt;at composers which she had heard her father jilny upon the pipe organ, then as now a part of tiie family establishment.

At eleven she became organist of tlie vil- lage church, and since that time she has played some of the largest organs in this country and in Europe. Her mother was her instructor in the higher mathematics, literature, and Latin; and her father was her first teacher in music. It was the custom of the family to gather in the nmsic room at evening time to sing, and on these occasions tlie old mansion would ring with the strains of anthem and oratorio, to the accom]ianiment of organ, piano, violin, and violoncello, performers upon each instrument being found in the family circle. To her famil- iarity with music of the best cla.ss in hei' chihlhood, ^Irs. Morey attributes nmch of her success.

At eighteen years of age she commenced study with Junius W. Hill, of Boston, and remained with him until her marriage to Herbert Iv Morey in 1874. Of this miion there have been five children â€” Eleanor Stevens, Ernest Manuel (now deceased), Hilda Evangeline, David Beale, and Laura Carver.

David B. and Almira (Bailey) Morey, parents of Herbert E. Morey, were prominent among the abolitionists, contributing of their means to the support of the movement : and their house was a station on the underground rail- road. David B. Morey was closely associated with William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Parker Pillsbury, and other prominent anti- slavery leaders. On one occasion he protected Parker Pillsbury from a mob, holding them off at the ])oint of a pistol, ^\'hen the war broke out, and troops were starting for the front, the town illuminated. He refused to illuminate his house until he knew whether the Union was to be with or without .slav'ery. And in this he persisted, although notified by the town authoi'ities, who were at that time pro-slavery in .sentiment, that they could not promise him protection. At the time of John lirown's raid he with others hired Tremont Temple and per- sisted in occupying it in spite of the opjjosition of a pro-slavery mob encourageil by police assistance. He was a charter member of the Theodore Parker Fraternity.
