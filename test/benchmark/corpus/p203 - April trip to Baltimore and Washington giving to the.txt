April trip to Baltimore and Washington, giving to the work all the time there was, Sundays includetl. As a wife and mother she could tell the whole story of the anxiety which followed the absent husband and father. Her interest in the families of in&lt;ligent and suffering veter- ans did not await for its application the or- ganization of the Relief Corps. Long before the good women of the land had formed their invaluable band, she had sought out and helped relieve the wants of many a suffering house- hold. Thus, when the organization was pro- jected, she was ready to become one of the earliest members and one of the workers from the start. Serving in the liome corps in about all the offices there were, she has repeatedly represented the same in the State and national liodies. Among the many excellent presiding officers whom the local and department organ- izations have had, it will not be tof) much to state that no one has ever performed her duties more intelligently or effectually. Thoroughly posted in the working programme of the order, ready in thought and speech, graceful in action, her accomplishment of each and every assign- ment is a source of pleasure and pride to her friends; but, above all, her loyal devotion to the ends and aims of the Relief Corps, namely, the helping of those in distress, marks her as one of- the most .successful and gracious of Worcester's women."

Mrs. Robinson has been a jjrominent partici- pant in the State conventions of the Woman's Relief Corps for many years. She has been a member of the Department Executive Board, Department .lunior Mce-President, Senior A'ice- President, and at the annual convention held in Boston, February, 1899, she was luiani- mously elected Department President. Her tact, good judgment, and business ability were manifest throughout the year.

In the discharge of her duties while thus standing at the head of o\'er fourteen thousantl women, she attended many gatherings under the auspices of posts and corps in all sections of the State. Referring in her report to this part of her duties, she said: —

one of the ilepartnient officers to represent the department. As I look back, it seems as if I had been on the road the entire year, arriving at my home for Sundays only. I cannot take the space to enumerate all the diffeient gather- ings that I have attentled, l)ut they have been many. I began like a dutiful citizen by pay- ing my respects to our Governor, and closed by attending the dedication of the beautiful hall of Hartsuff Corps, of Rockland. Among the delightful occasions was the reception ten- dered me by my own corps, March 11, 1S99: and it is a pleasure to know that the honor that had come to one of its members was so highly appreciated by the members of the corps."
