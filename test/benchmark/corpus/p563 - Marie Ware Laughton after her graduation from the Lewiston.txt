Speech and Expression, of which she is prin- cipal. The aim of this school is to give in- struction in higher English and in the art of expression. Its marked success proves that public speakers, readers, and teachers of read-' ing and elocution in public schools and col- leges appreciate a school conducted by teachers who present sound methods. The school also meets the need of many who have no thought of entering a profession, but who realize the value of training for the development of power and for the opening up of new and enduring fields of culture.

EDNA DEAN PROCTOR.— It is an in- teresting question how far early envi- ronments of place and scene affect gift and character; but with a sympathetic, receptive, aesthetic nature, and surroundings of unusual individuality and beauty, there can be no doubt of their vivid impression and moulding force.

Edna Dean Proctor is of unmixed English ancestry. Her father, John Proctor, a na- tive of Manchester, Mass. (Manchester-by-the- Sea), was a descendant of John Proctor of England, who came to Ipswich, Mass., in 1635, and whoso eldest son, John Proctor, of Salem Village, was one of the victims in August, 1692, of the Salem witchcraft delusion. The Good- hues, the Cogswells, the Appletons, the Choates, of Essex County, were allied with this family. Her mother, Lucinda Gould, of Henniker, N.H., represented the Goulds who had come from Massachusetts to the newer settlement and the Prescotts and Hiltons of Hampton and Exeter, N.H. The Proctor family removed from Manchester-by-the-Sea to Henniker, and chose their home u})on a hill overlooking the Con- toocook valley, the "pine-crowned hill" of her poem, "Contoocook River." The wide horizon of this noble elevation, her birthplace and early

home — embracing Kearsarge, Monadnock, and the outlying ranges of the White Hills — the broad forests, and the beautiful stream flowing through the meadows, made a grand and pictu- resque landscape, which is reflected again and again in her poems, and which may have been an inspiration to high themes.
