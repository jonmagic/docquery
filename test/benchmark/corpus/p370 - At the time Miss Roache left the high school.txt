"At the time Miss Roache left the high school, the English de|)artment suffereil a

blow from which it has never wholly recov- ered.

"Outside of her school, in the every-day affairs of life, she was altogether prone to espouse the cause of the suffering and op- pressed. She was an ardent advocate of Home Rule for Ireland, and never missed an oppor- tunity by tongue or pen to advance it. I think majority opinions had little weight with her, except as they commended themselves to her heail and heart. She believed that Edward B(&gt;llainy's theories are in the right direction, and she was an active member of the Nationalist Club of Lynn, formed in the eighties, associating in the work with such men and women as Dr. Benjamin Percival, Hannah M. Todd, CJeorge H. Carey, Dr. p]sther H. Hawkes, and Herman Kemp.

"Miss Roache is scholarly, but to an ex- tent that I have never seen surpassed she pre- serves the well-springs of human nature from drovight that cultm;e so frecpiently induces. She is a scholar indeed; but she never forgets that her first duty is to humanity as a whole, and not to any particular cliciue or class."
