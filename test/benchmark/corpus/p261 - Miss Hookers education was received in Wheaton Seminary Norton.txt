Miss Hooker's education was received in W^heaton Seminary, Norton, Mass., and in the State Normal School at West Newton. In her vacations she taught two sununer terms and two winter terms in the district schools of Falmouth, on Cape Cod. The State Normal School was then in charge of Eben S. Stearns, the well-known and loved Electa N. Lincoln, now Mrs. George A. Walton, being the able assistant. Nathaniel T. Allen, afterward long identified with the Classical School of West Newton, was the principal of the Model School, and the pupils of those days well remember his generous estimate of their abilities as they passed under his three w-ceks' training. Lu- cretia Crocker was then a student at the Normal

School, giving promise of the efficiency which afterward distinguished her official career.

Graduating in November, 1850, Miss Hooker was elected first assistant in the Oliver High School, Lawrence, Mass., T. W. T. Curtis being principal and George A. Walton master of the Grammar school in the same building. Miss Hooker afterward became an assistant in the Hartford High School, remaining until April, 1854.

She was married October 1, 1856, to the Rev. William Banfield Capron, of Uxbridge, Mass. They were appointed as missionaries of the American Board to Madura, South India, and sailed in an ice ship for Madras, November 21, the .voyage taking one hundred days. On ar- riving in Madura Mrs. Capron, was put in charge of the Madura Girls' Boarding School, now well known in the Madras Pre.sidency as the Madura Girls' Training and High School. Mr. Capron during this time was building a house in Mana Madura, thirty miles ilistant, to which they removed in 1864, the lady in charge of the Girls' School having returned from her furlough in America. Mrs. Capron's previous service was the prehule to the various forms of educational work of which she had charge until 1886, with the exception of one furlough of two years, from 1872 to 1874.

The work of a foreign miss'onary naturally resolves itself into two lines. There is the care for the planting, growth, and development of the Christian community. This should be self-propagating and self-sustaining, and to this end should all training be directed. There is also the endeavor to uplift all those within one's sphere of influence. The first step in the for- mer lies in the little day schools in the villages, planned to give instruction to the children of Christians; but these in all cases will include many more who are drawn by the attractive- ness of a school so differently conducted from the sing-song drone of the ordinary school- master of India. When it is considered that each station in charge of a resident missionary comprises from thirty to one hundred villages, in which are these schools, it will be seen that the missionary becomes a superintendent of schools. It is a gala day, indeed, when the missionary

lady comes to inspect the school. On such occasions there is the selection of the clever boy or bright girl, whether from a Christian family or not, to come to the next stage in this etluca- tional scheme.
