Since she came to New England, twelve years ago, the rise in club life of Mrs. May Alden Waril has been constant and rapid. At Frank- lin she organized a club of which she was the first president, and which was afterward named for her the Alden Clul). Later while living in Cambridge she was for four years president of Cantabrigia, one of the largest and most ener- getic clubs of the countrj'. At the same time Mrs. Ward became a member of the famous New England Woman's Club, in which she is still one of the most valued workers. For two years she was president of the New England Woman's Press Association, and she is strong in its councils at the present time. She is also a charter member and director of the Authors' Club of Boston. She was the first vice-presi- dent of the Ma.ssachu.setts State Federation for two years before becoming its president. She also has interest in various public affairs, and has been appointed one of the Commissioners for Massachusetts at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.

Mrs. Ward began lecturing about twelve years ago, resi)oiiding to the request of some ladies who asked her t&lt;i give parlor talks on French literature. As a lecturer and teacher she now does an enormous amount of work, her accuracy, her pleasing address, her direct- ness, and the large amount of information crowded into her lessons and lectures making her one of the most popular club lecturers in New England. Of her efforts in that field the New York Times has this to say: "Mrs. Ward

has the historian's instinct, and gives her facts without feeling the necessity of breaking into ejaculations over their picturesqueness. Her good training as a writer tells, as it always ought to tell; and her papers on subjects con- nected with our colonial history are written in a style both reticent and lively." Kate San- born's comment on her lectures is both true and adequate: "At the close of each course the audience feels acquainted with the men and women analyzed, and familiar with their best achievements; for she has the power to vitalize a subject, throwing arountl it the fascination felt by herself â€” a rare gift and akin to genius."

Aside from the prestige which the advance- ment in club circles may lend to her name, Mrs. Ward has won a reputation as a writer that rests on the firm foundation of merit. Among her books are a Life of Dante, Life of Petrarch, "Old Colony Days," and "Prophets of the Nineteenth Century." These have re- ceived great praise from literary critics. Her "Dante" and "Petrarch," it is freely conceded, each met the need of a concise life in iMiglish never before filled. William Dean Howells .says of the former: "While we are still upon Italian ground, we wish to speak of Mrs. May Alden Ward's very clear, unaffected, and inter- esting sketch of Dante and his life and works. The effort is something comparable to those processes by which the stain and whitewash of centuries is removed, anil the beauty and truth of some noble fresco underneath is brought to life again. Mrs. Ward has wrought in the right spirit, and she shows a figure, simple, conceivably like, and worthy to be Dante, with which she has apparently not suffered her fancy to play."
