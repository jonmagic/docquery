"She certainly had not the reputation of being a practical person. She was too readily interested in every scheme that offered good to the human race, too credulous of any intli- vidual who sought her help or comfort. In try- ing times her un.selfish help, her advice, hei' sympathy, were all fruitful of good results which had seemed hopeless to less believing and ardent natures.

"Goethe says, 'All philosophy must be lived and loved.' Such was the spirit in which I'ilizabeth P. Peabody spent her ninety years in constant service to mankind."

For four years in her early teens Mrs. A\'hit- ney was a student in the excellent private school for girls kept in Boston from 1823 to 1855 by George B. Emerson, one of the best of teachers New Paigland has ever produced, ami for one year she was at Northampton in the noted school of Miss Margarette Dwight, who was very thorougli, systematic, and successful in her vocation.

The first in the long list of jHiblications wliich have given Mrs. Whitney her enviable position among .\merican authors, and won for her a host of admiring readers, was "Mother Goose for Grown Folks," issued by Rudd &amp; Carleton in 1859. Then came "Boys of Chequasset," "Faith Gartney's Girlhood," and "The Gay- worthys," published by Loring. "A Sunmier in Leslie Goldthwaite's Life" first appeared as a serial in Our Young Folkfi in 1866; "Pa- tience Strong's Outings" in tlie Chrii^iian Rec/ister, 1868-70. Among her books of later (late may be mentioned "We Girls," "Real Folks," "Sights and Insights," " Bonnybor- ough," "A.scutney Street," four volumes of poems, one of them entitled "Pansies," and five miscellaneous volumes, one being "Just How, a Key to the Cook-book." "Squai-e Pegs, a Novel," came out in the autunm of 1894, marking the completion of her seventieth year, and was well receivetl, being a worthy successor of the foregoing, not one of the ephemera, but a l)ook to be read ami reread.
