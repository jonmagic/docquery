REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

resolution was defeated, a large majority taking tlic ground that women, being members of the society, were entitled to all the rights, privi- leges, and duties pertaining to membership. In May, 1839, the question again came up, this time at the annual meeting of the American Anti-slavery Society, in New York. An excit- ing discussion followeil the appointment of Miss Kelley to a committee, the fiuestion being decided as before. The next year it was set- tled, once for all, that in the American Anti- slavery Society and its auxiliaries throughout the country the women should take part as freely as the men in all the work of the public meetings, even to the point of presiding on important occasions."

It was in 1839 that Miss Kelley's recognized career as a lecturer began. She had alreatiy been baptized with the terrible flame of per- secution in the solitary Connecticut campaign, and whatever of abuse and vilification now assailed her she could bear with comparative equanimity, supported by the strong band of brave and loyal souls who had pledged to the cause of the slave their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. From this time till her marriage, in 1845, Miss Kelley devoted herself untiringly to anti-slavery work. She spoke in conventions not only, but nuide long trips through remote country districts, speak- ing in churches, whenever they could be ob- tained; when not, in school-hou.ses. Some- times arrangements were made by the society's agent; but she often had to be her own agent, learning from her last host who in the surround- ing towns would help her to get up meetings, and who would receive her at their houses, for she had no money to pay hotel bills. For many years she received no salary, her trav- elling expenses only being paid by the society, and her most pressing needs for clothing being supplied by her friends. Many annising anec- dotes might be related of these lecture tours. She, like Dickens, was given her choice of "corn bread and common doin's" or "white bread and chicken fixin's." In the new settle- ments of the West, where the kitchen sink or the well was the common bath-room for the family, and a single dish (sometimes the iron skillet) served each in turn as a wash-basin,

her hostesses discovered that an occult con- nection existed between a woman lecturer and a pan of water — a luxury which Miss Kelley always insisted upon having in her room. In those days of pork and bacon it was extremely difficult to get suitable food, but eggs and potatoes could usually be obtained. Travelling was a terrible undertaking. At first no rail- roatls, then only a few between the larger cities, stage-coaches or wagons, and roails of every degree of muddiness or roughness, with the corduroy road of logs as the extreme of torture — these were the only means of conveyance for the pioneers of the anti-slavery cause.
