the same year, she continued, with the exception of three years, to teach for twenty-two years, most of the time in East Ahington. She was principal of a grammar sciiool for hfteen years, receiving most of the years the same salary as that paid men holding a similar position. This came as the result of her arguments with the school committee regarding the question of equal rights, the members of the conunittee being convinced that she had justice on her side. Miss Loud was elected a member of the Rockland School Board in LS87, and .served in that capacity until LS90.

From LS72 to LS7r) she was a speaker in the woman suffrage cause, performing able .service for this movement by her convincing argu- ments and earnest manner. In 1S84 a new paper was starteil in Rockland, and an invita- tion extendetl to Mi.ss Loud to become its edi- tor. She named the pajjcr The Independent. Five years later she purchased the entire prop- erty connected with the paper, including the job printing as well as the publishing busine-ss. The paper, which is devoted to social and political reform, continues to be successfully conducted by Mi.ss Loud, who is sole proprietor. In her opening editorial in 1889, after the paper came into her hands, she announced that she had gone into the newspaper business with the .sole purpo.se to help save the world, and her ways of saving it would appear in fut- ure editorials. The Independent is an eight-page paper, and she has averaged a page of editorials each week. As a ])ublisher she has shown excellent business ability, and the articles from her pen are in harmony with the name of her paper. She is a womaii who has the courage of her convictions, and fearlessly denounces unjust measures. The Independent represents the highest principles, and is supported by people who have the interests of the public at heart. The fact that she has continued in its management for .so many years proves that her efforts are appreciated.

Miss Loud represented the National Assembly of the Knights of Labor at the Wonian's Inter- national Congress, held in Washington, D.C., in March, 1888, aufl addressed the congress upon the subject, " Women in the Knights of Labor." Her addresses have been received

with enthusiasm, but home life is more con- genial to her than public life, and she prefers newspaper work to the lecture platform. In 1891 she adopted two grand-nephews, and had a hou.se built for them near her old home. The eldest, Ralph Powers, was fataly injured by falling from his bicycle in 1898. His brother Carl was graduated from the Rockland High School in June, 1903.

ELEANOR BALDW^IN CASS was born in Charlestown, Mass., less than thirty years ago. She is the daughter of Charles F. and Mary (Gilbert) Baldwin. Her maternal grandfather, Robert Gilbert, was an Irishman. One of her paternal an- cestors, Jean Gieto, who was a Frenchman, left Paris at the time of the commune (1789- 94) and came to America. He attained the great age of one hundred and six. The family, it may be said, is noted for longevity and ath- letic ability.
