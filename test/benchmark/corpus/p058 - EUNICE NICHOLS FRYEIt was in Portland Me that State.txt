she was quick to foresee the benefits which a State organization would confer upon clTib women in Maine, the State whose motto is "Dirigo." She it was who invited representa- tive club women to meet in her parlors to con- sult in regard to the advisability of such a step. Three months later, September 23, 1892, the first State federation was formed, with nine- teen clubs as charter members and Mrs. Fvyc its secretary. Other States soon followed this example, and the result has been most happj\

Mrs. Croly (Jennie June) said of Mrs. Frye, "She is the Alma Mater of clubs and club women of Maine, a woman of large heart and broad intelligence, who works toward the best end without any shadow of pettiness or self- seeking." As the press notices and reports of various literary and philanthropic movements in Portland testify to occasions when prelimi-' nary meetings were held in Mrs. Frye's parlors, so the subsecjuent accounts invariably tell of wise plans faithfully carried out for the general good. Mrs. Frye has a genius for organizing, working with indomit;d)l(&gt; energy and anima- tion for present and future good.

Mrs. Frye was the first president of the Board of Directors of the Mary Brown Home, a highly useful institution founded on broad princi|)les. This is a resting-place for sick and broken- down women, who have always been indus- trious, self-supi)orting, and self-respecting. It is unique in having, beside the regular directors, an advisory board of men and women, as well as a co-operative board of helpers from busi- ness houses where women are employed. This plan for an invalids' home was originated by a little band of Methodist women. Some mem- bers of the Universalist church next became interested, and finally all the churches took hold of the work. Mary Cobb was the pioneer worker, and Mrs. Brown (for whom the home is rfow called) made a practical begimiing pos- sible in the summer of 1894 by giving the use of her cottage at Trefethern's Landing. Later a cottage was purchased at 28 Revere Street, Portland. There was soon a demand for more than its twelve rooms, and a new and larger building has been built on the site of thr ancient Bradley Meeting-hou.se, a site which was a gift to the directors for that purpose. During the

nine years over a hundred invalids and broken- down women had shelter and care, and all but seven of this number have been restored to health and have gone back to their work. The labor, the tact, the time and strength, to say nothing of the open purse which Mrs. Frye has had ready as the occasion has de- manded in this particular service, show how nmch it has been a labor of love. How truly she is a philanthropist! One is not surprised to learn that she comes of strong Quaker stock. Mrs. Frye was born at Vassalborough, Me., January 8, 1852, being the daughter of Caleb and Maria Nichols. Her father and mother were elders in the Vassalborough Society of Friends, and for years clerks of the business meetings. Always working in the interests of progress in the town, they were trustees from its organization of Oak Grove Seminary, a l''riends' school at Vassalborough. Their daughter Eunice was mostly eilucated in that seminary, being a student there for years. She was for some time the principal of the Uni- tarian Friends' School at Orchard Park, N.Y., now a normal school. In her girlhood she spent several winters with her brother. Dr. Charles H. Nichols, superintendent of the Government Hospital for the Insane at A^'ashington, D.C.
