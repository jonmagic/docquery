national melody, then some sweet or plaintive hymn to strengthen the fainting heart; and I remember how her notes penetratetl to every part of the building. Soldiers with less painful wounds, from the rooms above, began to crowd out into the entries, and men from below crept up on their hands and knees, to catch every note and to receive of the benediction of her presence, for such it was to them. Then she went away. I did not know who she was, but I was as much moved and melted as any sol- dier of them all."

When the steamer containing the wounded and the members of the Auxiliary Corps left Fredericksburg (it being necessary to evacuate the town) and reached Port Royal, they were besieged by negroes. They came in such num- bers and were so earnest in their appeals for rescue that a government barge was appropri- ated for their use. Mr. Reed says: "A thou- santl were stowed upon her decks. They had an evening .service of prayer and song, and the members of the corps went on board to witness it. When their song had ceased. Miss Gilson addressetl them. She pictured the reality of freedom, told them what it meant and what they would have to do. No longer would there be a master to deal out the peck of corn, no longer a mistress to care for the old people or the children. They were to work for them- selves, provide for their own sick, and support their own infirm ; but all this was to be done under new conditions. . . . Then in the simplest language she explainetl the difference between their former relations with their master and their new relations with the Northern people, showing that labor here was voluntary, and that they could only expect to secure kind employers by faithfully doing all they had to do. She coun.selled them to be truthful, eco- nomical, unselfish, and to guide their lives by kindly deeds."

Cold Harbor and City Point were scenes of Miss Gilson's labors, and then in company with Mrs. Barlow, wife of General Francis C. Barlow, she went to the front of Petersburg. They ministered there to the wounded of the Second and Eighteenth Army Corps. Afterward for several months Miss Gilson was at the Base Hospital at City Point.

"Up to this time," says Mr. Reed, "the colored troops had taken but a passive part in the campaign. They were now first brought into action in front of Petersburg, when tlie fighting was so desperately contested that many thousands were left ujjon the field. The wounded were brought down rapidly to City Point, where a temporary hospital had been provifled. It was, however, in no other sense a hospital than that it was a depot for wounded men. There were defective management and chaotic confusion. The men were neglected, the hospital organization was imperfect, and the mortality was, in consequence, frightfully large. Their condition was horrible. The se- verity of the campaign in a malarious country had prostrated many with fevers; and typhoid, in its most malignant forms, was raging with increasing fatality.
