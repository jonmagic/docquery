In the autunui of 1776, when New Jersey was invaded by the British, at the earnest solicitation of Washington, he again took the field, and, at the heail of the military force he had raised, marched as far as the Hudson River at Peekskill, where he was taken ill with pleu- risy, and died in February, 1777, in the seventy- first year of his age.

On June 17, 1898, it may be mentioned, Mrs. Chapman attended the unveiling of the monument in the old churchyard at Peekskill, erected by the Sons of the Revolution anil his descendants. One of the inscriptions reads as follows: â€”

Peekskill, February 1], 1777. I go cheerfully, for I am sure the cause we are en- gaged in is just ; and the call I have to it is clear and

the call of God.

Seth Pomeroy.
