Mrs. Baker's reminiscences of her girlhood give interesting pictures of country life in the thirties and forties of last century. "Every daughter," she says, "had her work planned and systematized. Those were strenuous times. The family rose at five in the morning, even in winter, getting and eating breakfast by candle-light." Beside the ordinary work of hoasekeeping there was much to be done at special times in the course of the year. Among other things she sjiecifies the "cider to be 1)oiled down, barrels of apple sauce to be made for home use and for regular customers, apples to be cut and dried, cucumbers to be pickled, yeast cakes to be made antl dried for the coming year, pumpkins to be cooked and dried, sausages to l)e made, candles to be clipped or later run in moulds."

" I remember the cooking of chickens and turkeys on the spit of the tin kitchen set be- fore the open fire, the baking of johnny-cake on a wooden form, the first rotary stove and the pleasure of turning it. (irandfather was very busy at the sho]) with his loom in those early days. He wove our woollen sheets for winter use, also the material for our winter gowns, ^'ery warm and strong it was. During vacations we were taught to liraid straw, each having her stint of so many yards of braiding, and then knitting so many times round before we could go out to play." Mental diversion was sometimes happily combined with work, so that it was "not always drudgery." Then, too, there were special seasons of festivity and fun. "Thanksgiving Days were times to be looked forward to and prepanMJ for the whole previous year. As years pas.sed on, the tables, l)ountifully spread, grew larger and larger. In the evening all kinds of games were played, the

father, the youngest player of all, the evening ending with singing, Bible reatling, and prayer." Considering herself ])rimarily a home-maker, caring for husband and .son, and exercising hos- pitality, Mrs. Baker continues in her old-time habits of reading and study. For leisure hours she finds congenial employment in making scraii-books. Of these she has "many for many purposes," and she hopes they will be pleasing and useful to the coming generation. Looking back, she says: "Certain physical and mental traits have descended through all the generations — strong constitutions, long lives, large families, habits of industry, good mental abilities, and a high standard of morals."

Another was Tristram Coffin, who.se descendants trace their lineage back to the Nantucket home with pride; and beside these were .lames Trowbridge, John Whipple, Edward Jackson, John \A'ard, and Ebenezer Stone, all prominent men in the early days of Newton and C'amljridge.
