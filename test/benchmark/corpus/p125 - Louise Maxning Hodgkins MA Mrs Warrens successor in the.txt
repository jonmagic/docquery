Lawrence University at Appleton, Wis., both as a teacher and student. She received from the institution her degree of Master of Arts in 1876. In 1877, as professor of EngUsh hterature at \\'ellesley College, she entered upon her next notable educational work, beginning a term of efficient antl highly appreciated service, that lasted fourteen years. The enterprise was a new one, and upon her devolved the task of arranging a course of study in her depart- ment suited to the needs of the times. In 1891 she resigned her professorship, that she might give her time solely to literary work. She has been successful both as an author and lecturer. Among the books that she has written may be named " Nineteenth Century Authors of Great Britain and the United States," "Study of the English Language," and "Via Christi," the last a fascinating volume of missionary annals, published by Macmillan in October, 1902, which in less than two years had reachetl a sale of nearly fifty thousand copies. Miss Hodgkins has edited Milton's Lyrics and Mat- thew Arnold's "Sohrab ami Rustum."

To the Woman'a Missio)iary Friend Miss Hodgkins, it is said, "has given a fresh impetus on many lines, and it is not surprising that its subscription list lengthens each year."

Mi.ss Hodgkins has visited Europe four times for special studies, attentling lectures at the College PVan^ais in Paris, studying in the Girls' Normal School at Hanover and with private tutors in Leipzig and Berlin, also in the Univer- sity of Oxford. Her present home is in Auburn- dale, Mass.

Lucy Amelia J.\meson, now Mrs. Lucy Jameson Scott, was born in Irasburg, Vt., November 27, 1843, daughter of Alexantler and Sarah (Locke) Jameson. She completed her school studies at the \''ermont Conference Seminary, and was graduated as the valedic- torian of her class. On July 17, 1867, she be- came the wife of the Rev. Orange W. Scott, a minister of the Methodist P^piscopal Church. Soon after the organization of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society Mr. Scott was pastor of a church in Haverhill, Ma.ss. Joining an aux- iliary, Mrs. Scott served for some time as its corresponding secretary, later as the first sec-

retary of the New Hampshire Conference. In 1874 she represented the New England Branch at the executive committee meeting. As the years went on, she became more and more widely known as a worker in the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society and Woman's Chris- tian Temperance Union and as a contributor to the Youth's Companion and other popular papers, as well as to religious {)eriodicals, also as a writer of books for Sunday-school libraries. The latest of her productions is " Twelve Little Pilgrims," pul)lished by Revell, an in- teresting story and a valuable book to interest children in missionary work. Since this writer of children's books and stories became, in 1890, editor of the Children s Missionary Friend, this publication has reached a circulation of nearly thirty thousand. Time has shown that she is the right woman in the right place. Mrs. Scott is the mother of three sons anil two daughters.
