ELIZABETH PALMER PEABODY, edu- cator and author, was born in Billerica, Mass., May 16, 1804, daughter of Dr. Nathaniel Peabotly and his wife, Eliza- beth Palmer. She was the eldest of three nota- ble sisters, of whom in her latest years she was the sole survivor. The one nearest her in age was Mary Tyler, b(jrn in Cambridge in 1806, who married Horace Mann; and the other was Sophia Amelia, who became the wife of Nathan- iel Hawthorne.

The father, Nathaniel Peabody, a lineal de- scendant of Francis Peabody, of Topsfield, the immigrant progenitor of the family of this name in New England, was graduated at Dart- mouth College in 1800. For some years, later in life, he practised dentistry in Salem and Bos- ton. He married in 1802 Elizabeth Palmer, who had been preceptress of the girls' depart- ment of an incorporated school in North An- ( lover, Mass., of which he was the principal, the school in 180.'^ being named l&lt;&gt;anklin Academy. A "lady of rare gifts and attainments," Miss Palmer was a successful teacher, winning the respect and affection of her i)upils and inciting

in them a love of learning. She was the daugh- ter of Joseph Pearse and Elizabeth (Hunt) Palmer and grand-daughter of General Joseph Palmer of 'Revolutionary times, who with his wife Mary, sister of Judge Richard Cranch, came to Boston from Devonshire, England, in 1746. Her maternal grandfather was John Hunt, of Watertown (Harvard College, 1734), whose son, Samuel Hunt, her uncle, was for about thirty years master of the Boston Latin School.

Joseph Pearse Palmer (Harvard College, 1771) was one of the Boston Tea Party in De- cember, 1773, and he also served his country in the Revolution. Some years after the close of the war he removed to Framingham, where he taught school. He diet! in Vermont in 1797, seven years before the birth of the grand- daughter whose name heads the present sketch. After his death his wife and chiklren resided in Watertown.

Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, descended from this worthy, patriotic, and scholarly ancestry, was a precocious child, early displaying un- usual mental abilities and a fondness for stutly. At the age of sixteen she began to teach school in Lancaster. She subsequently taught succes- sively in Hallowell, Me., in Brookline, Mass., with her sister Mary, and in Boston. She was acquainted with a number of languages, an- cient and modern, learning Polish when she was well advanced in years; and she excelled as a teacher of history, in which she had classes.

In September, 1834, Mr. A. Bronson Alcott opened hi.s* school at the Masonic Temple, Bos- ton. His diary thus mentions his assistant: " Mi.ss Peabyody, whose reputation both as re- gards original and acquired ability is high: she unir^s intellectual and practical qualities of no ccnunon order."

Miss Peabody's great work, begun after she was fifty years old, was as an interpreter of Froebel's system of education and introducer of the kindergarten into this country.
