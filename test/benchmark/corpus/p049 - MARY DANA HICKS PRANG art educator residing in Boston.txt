MARY DANA HICKS PRANG, art educator, residing in Boston, was born in Syracuse, N.Y., October 7, 1836, daughter of Major and Agnes A. (Johnson) Dana. The Dana family to which she belongs has a record in New England of over two hundred and fifty years, its immigrant progenitor, Richard Dana, having come to this country in 1640, and settled in Cambridge, Mass. From RichanP the line continued through Daniel,^ Thomas,^ Daniel,^ Daniel,'* to Major Dana, above mentioned, who was of the sixth generation, Mrs. Prang being of the seventh. Mrs. Prang's father was a prosperous merchant, a man of sterling character, who supported every forward movement. Among his remarkable qualities were a memory that never failed and an usual appreciation of beauty of effect, of fine design, and of harmony of color. Her mother, who was a brilliant woman, a poet and artist, was a leader in the literary society of Syracuse. Benevolent enterprises received her encouragement, and she was an inspiration to all who had the pleasure of her acquaint-

ance. She lived to the advanced age of ninety- four years.

Mary Dana was an observant little girl, and at the age of two years had learned her letters from large handbills. For some time she was a ]3upil in a private school close by her home. Throughout her school life she was found equal to children three or four years older.

She was graduated from the Allen Seminary, Rochester, N.Y., in 1852, after a course of study in mathematics, the languages, and history, with general study of the sciences; and later she pursued special studies at Harvard and at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

On her twentieth birthday she became the wife of Charles Spencer Hicks, a promising* young lawyer of Syracuse. In less than two years her husband was drowned. On April 15, 1900, she married Louis Prang, of Boston, the distinguished art publisher.

Owing to financial reverses in 1858, she re- ceived private pupils, the greater number being in drawing. Her work with these pupils led her to a deep consideration of the influence of art instruction on education. Drawing was conniionly regarded as an end to be attained only by the specially gifted. Close study and wide observation confirmed her in the belief that drawing should be a study not for the few only, but for all, a means of expression for every child, and therefore should be an integral part of public school education.

Receiving the ap})ointment of supervisor of drawing in the public schools of Syracuse, she visited several of the larger cities in the country, to observe school conditions. She found that drawing had a place in neaily every course of study, but that there was actually very little work of merit accomplished. More favorable conditions existed in Boston than elsewhere, l)ut even in that city drawing was not given the prominence to which she believed it justly entitleil. Strengthened in her judgment re- specting the value of art-teaching in the public schools, she continued her work in Syracuse with increased enthusiasm.
