Alice Kent was married in Charlestown, in 1879, to William Duncan Robertson, M.D., and until his death, in 1883, resided with him at Stanstead, P.Q., returning then to the Charlestown home of lier j^arents. The mar- riage was without issue.

In the years directly following, Mrs. Robert- son carried on by herself a serious study oi Browning, so that when the Boston Browning

Society was formed in 1885 she was ready to take great interest in its work. At one of the early meetings her interpretation of "James Lee's Wife" was received with marked favor, being the forerunner of her later success in this line. Until 1889 Mrs. Robertson's work was in ever-increasing demand, and she read en- tirely for charity on numberless occasions.

In 1890 she made a tleparture in her work by giving a subscription course of readings from Shakespeare and Browning in Boston drawing-rooms. Her immediate success war- rantetl her continuance, and she appeared before many wonien's clubs in and about Boston until 1897, when, on January 20, she gave her first public reading at the Christian Association Hall, Boston.

During Mrs. Robertson's school-days Mrs. Julia Ward Howe started a girls' club in the Back Bay district, Boston, to meet Saturtlay mornings to read and discuss literature, with the idea of fostering the literary passion which her youngest daughter and her friends had acquired at school. This Saturday Morning Club gave occasional theatricals for charity, and in a production of Tennyson's "Princess," in May, 1885, Mrs. Robertson for the first time essayed a man's part, playing the Prince with much skill. At another time the club pro- duced Browning's "In a Balcony" in Charles Adams's little hall on Tremont Street, ^\vs. Robertson taking the part of the Qu^en. Th.is proved so successful that by urgent request the performance was repeated in New Yoi'k, for charity, at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre. Mrs. Robertson has played the t^ueen manj^ times. Mr. Edward H. Clement, editor-in- chief of the Boston Evening Transcript, says of her in an editorial, April 3, 1897: "To judge only by her truly thrilling performance — at once graceful and tender and overw'helmingly powerful — of the Queen in Browning's Balcony, if Mrs. Robertson should go upon the profes- sional stage and play the great tragic roles, the Saturday Morning Club would gain perma- nent fame as the Alma Mater of the finest genius of tragedy since Ristori."

The next noteworthy performance of this club was the Sophocles "Antigone," with Mrs. Robertson as Creon the King. The play was

given at Bumstead Hall, Boston, March, 1890, and was a great artistic success. In the diffi- cult nMe of Creon, Mrs. Robertson showed the possibilities that were later to win her fame in the "Winter's Tale," which was given in Feb- ruary, 1895. The extraordinary interest awak- ened by this performance will not soon be for- gotten. Historically it was absolutely correct, dramatically it was a revelation. Boston was familiar with the play only through Mary Anderson's production of it during her last visit here. Her Leontes was a man of no great dramatic power, who.se work was mediocre and colorless. Mrs. Robertson had fairly to create the part. The Boston Transcript referred as follows to hei' undertaking: "To conciuer Le- ontes with tone and dress and stride and man- ner is, to begin with, an apparently impossible task, but it was accomplished.
