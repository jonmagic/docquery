Miss Dixon has sei'ved as pastor of this church at Tyngsborough for seven years with marked success. Its meml)ership since she came here has increa.sed nearly one-third.

KATE SANBORN.â€” Breezy Meadows, cool, shady, a brook singing along a few steps from the piazza; cattle, sleek and contented, grazing on the rolling slopes of upland pasture; fields of grow- ing timothy and clover, grain and corn, on every hand. A garden, blossoming full with flowers of our grandmothers' day, antl new varieties also, leads into but half hides another, where grow old-fashioned and new-fangled fruits, berries, and vegetables, for the refreshment of mistress and guests.

The hand of the landscape artist has never touched the place. Rose-bushes and a few shrubs grow at will about the house, which is an old-fashioned one, standing in their niitist well back from the highway. Great trees are near, but not many shadow the building, which gives out such an air of sunshine, of inbred hospitality, that one smiles before pounding a summons on the brass knocker, and keeps on smiling, for the welcome from the mistress is sincere.
