Prescott, was a son of A\'illiam Pei)perell Prescott and his wife, Harriet de Les Dernier, whose father, Peter F. C. de Les Dernier, was born in Halifax, N.S., of Swiss parents.

Henry Prescott, father of \\'illiam P. Pres- cott, was a lineal descendant, in the fourth gen- eration, of John Prescott, an early .settler of Jjancaster, Ma.ss. Mary Newmarch Prescott, wife of Henry, was a daughter of Joseph and Dorothy (Pepperell) Newmarch, a granrl-daugh- ter of William' Pepperell, of Kittery, and niece of Sir Willianr' Pepperell, the victor of Louisburg.

Mrs. Rose Terry Cof)ke, in bygone years a fellow-worker with the pen, thus wrote of Harriet Prescott in her girlhood in Maine: A "lithe, active child, full of (juaint wit and keen questioning, she ran wild through her earlier

years in the pure air and fragrant breath of pine forests and sea breezes, laying the founda- tion of her exce]itional health and strength."

At the age of fourteen Harriet Prescott went to Newburyport to live with an aunt and attend the Putnam Free School, "a remarkably good school," as it has been desciibed, "kept by William G. Wells, a celebrated teacher." Her native talent soon manifested itself: she re- ceived the first prize, in a series instituted by Thomas AVentworth Higginson and Professor Aljiheus Crosby, "for a very daring anil orig- inal e,s.say on Handet, written at sixteen." She further attaineil an enviable distinction and popularity among her classmates by writing several dramas, which were enacted in the school exhibitions. After her graduation from the Putnam School she continued her studies for a time at Pinkerton Academy in Derry, N.H., where her widowed mother and the younger children were then living. Before long the family returned to Newburyport.
