ISABELLA ABBE POTTER, now serv- ing her seventh year as president of the Woman's Club House corporation, hav- ing been first elected in 1898, and re- elected for the sixth time in January, 1904, is the wife of a well-known business man of Boston, \A'illiam W. Potter, and resides in Brookline. Born in the town of Lee, Berk- shire County, Mass., daughter of Porter and Rubina (Abbe) Strickland, she comes of long lines of New England ancestors, extending back to the early settlement of the Bay Colony.

Her father was a native of Amherst, Mass., and son of Francis L. Strickland and Jerushy Gaylord. Her mother was daughter of Oba- diah and Margaret (Marsh) Abbe and grand- daughter of Lemuel Marsh, whose father, John Marsh, was graduated from Harvard College in 1726.

Througli Lemuel Marsh Mrs. Potter is de- scended from the Rev. John Wilson, the first minister of Boston, and from the Rev. Thomas Hooker, of Hai'tford, the families of these two Puritan ilivines being united by the marriage of Mr. Wilson's son, the Rev. John Wilson, Jr., first minister of Medfield, Mass., and Mr. Hooker's dauglUer Sarah. John Wilson, third, born of this union in 1660, became a physician, and settled in Braintree. His tlaughter, Sarah Wilson, married in 1701 John Marsh, Sr., and was the mother of John Marsh, born in Brain- tree in 1702, above mentioned as tlie father of Lemuel and grandfather of Margaret Marsh, Mrs. Potter's maternal grandmother.

The early education of Mrs. Potter, received in the public schools of Springfield, Mass., was supplemented by a three years' course of private instruction in music, languages, physical culture, and practical kindergarten work. She then — still bearing her maiden name of Strickland — became an enthusiastic and successful teacher, holding the position of principal of a group of schools in Springfield.

Miss Strickland was the first teacher to intro- duce object teaching and kind(&gt;rgarten work into those schools. She left teaching to become the wife of William \\'alker Potter, a success- ful Boston business man, trustee of Boston University, member of the Wesleyan Asso- ciation and other organizations. They were married May 21, 1873, and have since resided in their beautiful home in Brookline. They have one child, Helen Wilson I^otter.
