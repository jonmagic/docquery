MARY A. LR'KRMORl'], LL.D., pub- lic si)eaker and writer, during the Civil War one of the foremost of the Sanitary Commission workers, and in these later years an able antl distinguislied advocate of social reform, is a thorough New I'jigland woman ])y birth and breeding, and through six generalions of paternal ancestry. Born in Boston on December 19, 1820, daughter of Timothy and Zeliiah \'ose Glover (Ashton) Rice, slie bore until marriage the name Mary Ashton Rice. She was one of a family of six children, only one of whom besides herself — a sister Abby, Mrs. Coffin — attained adult age and is now living.
