Miss Runisey also saw active ser\'ice among the wounded and dying on the battle-fiekl. Mr. Frank Moore, in "Women of the War," gives the following account &lt;if her work after the second battle of Bull Run, fought August 30, 1862: "Mr. Fowle obtained an ambulance, and Miss Rumsey loaded it with some four hundred antl fifty loaves of bread, meat, spirits of all kinds, bandages, lint, shirts, and other stores. Leaving Washington late on Saturday afternoon, they drove out by way of Bailey's Cross-roads, ami reached Centreville very early on Sunday morning. They halted at a little building near the road, which was already nearly full of the wounded. . . .

had eaten nothing for twenty-four liours, anil were hopelessly separated from their supply trains. After she had given out most of the bread and other eatables, she stepped down from the ambulance, and went inside to see if she could be of any use to the suffering." The terrible odor and scenes of suffering caused her to faint, hut upon recovering she chided her- self, saying: "To think that I have come all this way from Washington to bind up the wounds of these soldiers, and here the first case of running blood I see I have to become help- less. I won't faint. I will go back, and work among these poor fellows. That's what I came for, and I'm determined to accomplish some- thing."

During the year 1862 a great many books, papers, and magazines, received from friends in the North, were distributed by Mi.ss Rum.sey and Mr. Fowle in their hospital visits. In a little more than a year they thus disposed of two thousand three hundretl and seventy-one Bibles and Testaments, one thousand six hun- dred and seventy-fi\e books and magazines, forty thousand tracts, thirty-five tliousand papers, twenty-five reams of writing paper, nine thousand envelopes, also (juantities of clothing, sheets, wines, and jellies. In the same period they conducted nearly two thou- sand singing meetings at hospitals or in camp.

Tliere were times when thirty-four thousand sick, wounded, or convalescent soldiers were gathered in Wa.shington, nearly all of whom could read. Many were able to travel through the streets on crutches, and others could walk a .short distance unaided. For the benefit of these disabled patriots Miss Rumsey, Mr. Fowle, and Mrs. Walter Baker, of Dorchester, Ma.ss., conceived the idea of establishing a free library. To this end Miss Rumsey and Mr. Fowle gave in Washington, Boston, and other places, a number of patriotic vocal concerts, the i)rin- cipal feature of which was the songs of Miss Rumsey, and particularly those stirring ami patriotic airs which she had sung to so manj' of the soldiers.

In the meantime a petition was sent to Con- gress asking permission to erect a library build- ing on land in .Judiciary Square. The result is seen in the following resolution- "Resolved by
