President of Harvard Annex from the be- ginning, Mrs. Agassiz was President of Rad- cliffe until 1900, when she tenderetl her resig- nation. The extent, character, and value of her services to the college in this long period are known only to those who have been asso- ciated with her in its management or have at- teniled as students. She continued as Hon- orary President of the Associates of Radcliffe, who constitute its Corporation, and ex-officio member of the Academic Board and chairman of the Council, until the close of the academic year 1902-1903. On June 23, 1903, she pre- sided at the Commencement exercises, and conferred degrees on ninety-nine candidates — eighty Bachelors of Arts, and nineteen Masters of Arts. In the precetling week she had re- signed the acting presidency, feeling herself no longer equal to the res])onsil:)ilities of the position; and Dr. Le Baron Russell IJriggs, the second officer of Harvard University, had ac- cepted the presidency of Radcliffe College, the choice being one which gave Mrs. Agassiz "much pleasure and entire satisfaction." Mrs. Agassiz's letter of withilrawal closed with these words : —

"I am grateful for the length of years which has allowed me to see the fulfilment of our cherished hope for Radcliffe in this closer re- lation of her academic life and government with that of Harvard. With cheerful confi- dence in her future, which now seems assured

to me, with full and affectionate recognition of all that her Council, her Academic Board, antl her Associates have done to bring her where she now stands, I bitl farewell to my colleagues. At the same time I thank them for their un- failing support and encouragement in the work which we have shared together in behalf of Radcliffe College."

Released from her former responsibilities as ex-officio member of the Coimcil and chairman of the Academic Board, Mrs. Agassiz remains (1903-04) as Honorary President of the Asso- ciates of Radcliffe.

Professor Louis Agassiz is survived by the three children above named — Professor Alexan- der, director of the Agassiz Museum: Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw, antl l\Irs. Henry Lee Higgin- son.
