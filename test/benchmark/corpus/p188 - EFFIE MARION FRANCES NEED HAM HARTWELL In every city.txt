EFFIE MARION FRANCES NEED- HAM HARTWELL.â€” In every city and town of New England, safe to .say, at the present time women are to be found (juietly and earnestly striving to estab- lish better social conditions, conforming to higher ideals. Fitchburg, Ma.ss., is no ex- ception to this, and a leader among its women workers is Mrs. Hartwell, whose name in full appears at the head of this article.

Her father, Colonel Daniel Needham, was born in Salem, Ma.ss., of good Quaker stock, an energetic, active nature, ]&gt;ositive in opinion, and always taking his full share of the business of the State and local affairs. He married Miss Caroline Augusta Hall, of Boston, a woman of charmingly attractive personal character. Their fourth child, Effie Marion Frances, was born in Croton, Mass., January 9, ]&lt;S52. The family removed to Queechee, Yt., in 1855, living there among the mountains until Effie was twelve years of age, when they returned to their old home town, (troton was one of the academy towns of New England, which, be- fore the establishment by law of high schools in all tlie larger towns, were centres of learning and refinement. For a century or more the Lawrence Academy in Groton held high rank in its cla,ss, and here Miss Needham ac(iuired a soliil groimding in ed\ication, which was sup- plemented by a year of study at the Prospect Hill School in Greenfield, Mass., and a season

at the Misses Gilman's finishing school in Boston. From 1809 to 1877 she resided in Boston, and on October 23 of this latter year she was mar- ried to Harris Cowdrey Hartwell. Her home has since been in Fitchburg. Two sons were born to Mr. and Mrs. Hartwell, namely: Nor- cross Needham Hartwell, December 15, 1880; and Harold Hall Hartwell, May 6, 1891.

Mr. Hartwell was a native of Groton and an alumnus of Lawrence Academy. He was grad- uated at Harvard College in 1869. He studied law in Fitchburg, and was admitted to the bar in 1873. He was Repre.sentative from Fitch- burg in the Massachu.setts Legislature in 1883, 1884, 1885, and a State Senator in 1887, 1888, 1889, being president of the Senate in 1889. His untimely death in 1891 cut short a career of unusual promise. In Mr. Hartwell's public and official life his wife was his strong supporter and efficient help, and his manly qualities and public ])osition undoubtedly quickened her natural executive ability and strong desire to serve others. She has l)een itlentified with many of the best institutions of her city. She was the first president of the Fitchburg Woman's Club, continuing in office for six consecutive years; and during that time, under her vigorous administrative ability, the club took rank among the highest of the State in sohd educa- tive \york, healthy growth, and steadily in- creasing value to its members, becoming one of the acknowledged forces of the city. Mrs. Hartwell was a director of the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs, and has served on several of its committees. She is the vice-president of the Old Lailies' Home Cor- poration, the j)resident of its Ladies' Benevo- lent Society, and one of the stanchest sup- porters and workers for this useful institution, which has, from a small but earnest beginning, grown to own its large ami conunodious brick home, housing and providing for fifteen or twenty inmates.
