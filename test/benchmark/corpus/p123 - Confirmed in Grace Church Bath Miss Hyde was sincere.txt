Confirmed in Grace Church, Bath, Miss Hyde was sincere and unostentatious in her religious life. The Christian virtues and graces Ijeauti- fied her character. She took an active part in church work, and her own parish gratefully recalls the practical and financial assistance she renderetl. Thus, adorning her station in society, pursuing a life of un.selfish goodness, she was respected and loved by all.

It was in the midst of such a life, so bright and useful, that Miss Hyde was suddenly stricken down with incurable disease. Ten- derly ministered to with all that loving hearts could supply, for three months she bore her sufferings with beautiful patience and Christian fortitude. Then God called her to higher ser- vice on Sunday, August 27, 1899. On the twenty-eighth anniversary of her birth all that was mortal of Ethel Hyde was laid to rest amidst a sorrow that was universal. Many glowing tributes have been paid to her memory. The

regard in whidi she was held by those among whom she lived may be gathered from the words of her rector at the funeral service, when, speaking of the wonderful voice, he said, " It seemed as if it were the very expression of her life, tuned to a higher key — as all her life was — sweet, true, pure, inspiring," and from the opening and closing sentences of an etli- torial in the local paper: "The entire city mourns to-day for the sad death of Miss Ethel Hyde. . . . She will be held in long and grateful remembrance for her many deeds of charity and loving kindness."

The AVoman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America was organized in the Treniont Street Methotlist Episcopal Church, Boston, on a stormy March day in 1869 by eight women who responded to a call sent to thirty churches. A window in the Tremont Street Church commemorates the event and preserves their names. The first public meeting of the society was held in the Bromfield Street Methodist Episcopal Church, May 26, 1869. The speaking was quickly followed by decisive action. At a business meeting held by the women at the close of the public occasion it was voted to raise money to send as a missionary to India
