Mrs. Gifford has also given much time to club work, writing many i)apers and giving many lectures and talks. Her papers on "Ger- man Literature and German Authors," "Mis- sion Work in India" (the origin of the people from the Aryans, their early religious develop- ment, etc.), an article entitled "How to Travel," and her very celebrated lecture, " From the North Cape to the Orient," have attracted nmch attention. Her series of talks on archi- tecture, condensed for students and travellers, is to be the nucleus of a volume entitled " The Architecture of Cathedrals and Castles, for Students and Travellers," when time shall per- mit her to complete the work.

Mrs. Gifford through all those years of travel has retained her home in I'ortland, Me., and when in America it has always been hei- pleas- ure to spend her time in this beautiful little city by the sea and again get in touch with real New England life. Both at home and abroad her society is sought by jieople of culture, and she is a welcome presence in any gathering.

KATE E. GRISWOLD, proprietor and publisher of Profitalde Advertising, a monthly magazine issued in Boston, devoted to the interests of advertisers and })ublishers, is widely known as a success- ful journalist, the periodical of which she is the sponsor ranking, it is said, as foremost of its kind in the world. Miss Griswold was born about thirty-five years ago at West Hartford.

Conn. Her father, John Belden Griswold, a native of Newington, Conn., was born in 1828, son of Josiah Wells and Mary A. (Belden) Criswold. Her mother, whose maiden name was Cornelia Arnold Jones, was born at East Hartford in 1830, daughter of Joseph Pantra Jones and his wife, Sarah Comstock.

After pursuing her studies, both elenientarj' anil classical, at some of the best public and private schools in Hartford, she turned natu- rally enough to journalism, entering the office of. the Poultry World in that city. One of the practical Occui)alions of her girlhood at home had been the raising of poultry, which she had nuule financially profitai)le. Her story, as in all cases of genuine success, is a story of liard work and a slow climb from humble begiimings. Her promotion to a responsible position in the office of the National Trotting A.ssociation came within a year, and again illustrates the special fitness of things, for she is an enthusiastic devotee of the horse.

At the end of her second year constant appli- cation to an ever-increasing bvn-den of duties had worn her out, and for a time she was obliged to give up the struggle. Several years of re- tirement and rest, however, brought her again to the front with a renewed ston^ of strength.

Flattering offers were at Miss Griswold's di,Â«- posal, l)ut she turned from them all to take up the management of the organ of a local chari- table enterprise. To The Harljord Cihj Misf&lt;ion Record, and to the cause in general which it representeil, she devoted herself for the next four years. Toward the close of this period of charitable work she entered into .several prize competitions for advertising designs, and was perhaps not wholly surprised at carrying off the honors in a number of cases. The at- tention thus attracted to the fact of a woman's success as an "ad" writer led to an offer from Boston.
