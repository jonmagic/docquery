dren in the fold of Israel. On May 8, 1821, she enters in her diary: "Have been indulged this evenmg with a privilege never before by me enjoyed: have heard the universal love of God publicly contended for by the Rev. Sylvanus Cobb, a preacher of the Universalist order. Indeed, my soul has been abundantly feasted. How animating, how soul-cheering, the subject of God's universal and impartial benevolence ! To me it seems the most glorious theme men or angels can dwell upon; and, though I have never before heartl the doctrine publicly proclaimed from the pulpit, yet I have long enjoyed a firm belief therein, and have enjoyed great satisfaction therefrom. It is about a year and a half since I burst the har- rowing bonds of the narrow creed of partialism — man-made — and found light and joy in the glorious field of God's universal and impartial love, and I find I can gather daily of its whole- some and delicious fruits a fresh supply; and, should I be spareil to the common age of men, and be permitted to range the same broad field of glowing grace and partake of the heavenly bounties, I surely shall find a spiritual food sufficient for all my wants. In the good Father I fear not to trust."

Eunice's heart beat in sympathy with her soul. Sixteen months later she was united in marriage to the preacher who had so inspired that soul, the ceremony taking place at her stepfather's house in Hallowell, Me., on Sep- tember 10, 1822.

She became the mother of nine children, and a more affectionate and faithful mother has not lived. Their names and the dates of their birth are as follows: Sylvanus, Jr., June 5, 1823; Samuel Tucker, June 11, 1825; Eunice Hale, April 15, 1827; Eben, January 17, 1829; George Winslow, March 31, 1831: Sarah Waite, Decem- ber 1, 1832; Cyrus and Darius (twins), August 6, 1834 ; James Arthur, December 22, 1842.

Immediately after the death of James Arthur, at nine years of age, Mrs. Cobb, with a mother's fondness, wrote his memoir, poi-traying traits of character, remarkable for one so young, which she desired to be known as an example to others. Especially did she desire to publish to the world an account of a remarkable vision that he had, in which there appeared hovering

about him many angels, whose apf)earance and words he described with heavenly serenity. He repeated words spoken to him by the angels, and presently he exclaimed, "Oh, this is Sally'" His mother says, " My feelings here were inde- scribable, for this was a dear sister of mine, who died before I was married, and whom he knew nothing about."

From this time to the day of his death, some two months afterwartl, he longed to be with the angels with whom he had so happily con- versed. His life seemed transported. The faith his mother had implanteil in his mind had found its fruition in heavenly reality.
