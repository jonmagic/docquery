Some of her ancestral lines on the pa- ternal side she has traced, beyond a doubt, to the "Mayflower," and evidence at hand seems to show that she is descended from nine mem- bers of the Pilgrim band that landed on Plym- outh Rock in December, 1620, namely. Elder Brewster and his. wife Mary, William Mullines (or Molines) and his wife, John and Priscilla (xMuUines) Alden, William White and his wife Susanna, and their son Resolved White.

Joseph Emerson, Lieutenant John Sharpe, Lieutenant Stephen Hall, Lieu- tenant Criffin Craft, Lieutenant Moses Crafts, the Rev. Peter Bulkcley, the Rev. P^dward Bulkk^y, Captain Christopher Hussey, Robert Vose, Lieutenant James Trowbridge, Robert Taft, and Tliomas Cregson, Assistant of the Colony, first Treasurer, and first Connnissioner for the LTnion with other New England Colonies.
