conveyed the impression both of holiness and the beauty of it. There floats into my mind, as peculiarly applicable to him, a stanza from an elegy on Sidney included in some editions of the works of Spenser: —

" A sweet attractive kiude of grace, A full assurance given by lookes, Continuall comfort in a face.

The lineaments of Gospell bookes; I trowe that countenance cannot lie, Whose thoughts are legible in the eie."

He was peculiarly useful to young people. While they revered him, they could be easily familiar with him; and he showed them their possibilities, sympathized with their aspira- tions, corrected, encouraged, and led them on. If our friend were to undertake a statement of her obligations, I suspect she would confess no greater debt to any other than to him. Antl of great importance to her early life must have been a considerable group of young people who aspired, some of whom have since acquitted themselves well. Somehow they had caught hokl upon the truth that the better portion of the world was beyond their horizon, and that it was only l)y the highway of culture that they could reach that fairer ami ampler realm. The resources for culture were not bountiful, but they were not altogether wanting. The Ai- lantic Monthly anil Harper s Magazine, though not widely taken, were yet to be seen. The current literature was for most part beyond our reach, but a few classics we had — Pope, Thom- son, Goldsmith, Burns, Byron, Milton, Shake- speare, foo(.l for noble hungering; and these were read. The minister above mentioned here bore some aid. With an eye to the needs of his young people, he put into his Sunday-school library books of real literary value in place of the current stories of good little boys and girls who died so discouragingly young.

Such was the more general environment of Mrs. Humphrey-Smith's girlhood, wanting many things indeed, but not without its smile upon an earnest life. We come to her home. In its general appearance it was like the homes about her, perhajis, on the whole, a little better than the average. The house, still standing, but tenantless ami decaying, is a small cottage upon a hillside. Within it in her day was no

penury, no luxury, but plain comfort and un- pretending dignity. The family was consider- able, and servants were hardly heard of in that region; so her hands were early trained to mani- fold domestic toil. Her parents were Henry White and Laura Ann (Turner) Humphrey. Her father is said to have been a descendant of Peregrine White. Her mother was a daugh- ter of Charles Lee Turner and grantl-daughter of William Turner, of Scituate, Mass., who at an early period in the Revolutionary War was on the staff of Washington, with the rank of Major, and later was on the staff of General Charles Lee. A pleasant story tells that, a child having been born to him in his absence tluring a cam- paign, that general gave him a horse to ride home. This chiUl, a son, was named Charles Lee Turner. He was the grandfather of Mrs. Humphrey-Smith.
