large capacity for work. To these traits were added soundness of jndgment, strength of will, cheerfulness, unselfishness, and deep and un- affected piety. Thus it will be seen that she had the qualifications of the ideal teacher, and naturally she was soon sought for by the best private schools in New Elngland, having first served an apprenticeshij) in the ])ublic schools. ICverywhere she met with signal success. In the autumn of 1884 she opened the now well- known Gilman School, which rapidly outgrew its original quarters, and in 1890 was trans- ferred to its present location, 324 Common- wealth Avenue.

In this work she was ably assisted by her sister Julia, who resigned a position in the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind, South Boston, where she had taught for nine years, in order to engage in this larger service. She, too, had studied at the Foxcroft Academy, also with her aunt. Miss Rebecca I. Gilman, who for many years was principal of a large private school in Boston. It is interesting to note how strongly marked is the predilection for teaching in the various branches of this family.

Both sisters have given substantial proof of their attachment to the place where they received their early education bj' the assistance which they have lately rendered to the trustees of P'oxcroft Academy in raising an endowment fund for that institution. Evidence of the hold of these women upon the affection of their former pupils is seen in the fact that, when they solicited the money from this particular circle of friends, girls who had lio personal interest in the small village in Maine, the letters which came in reply to their appeal for gifts were full of love and loyalty.

To the strong influence for good which they exerted upon their pujjils another testimonial, among hundreds which might be adduced, appears in this extract from a letter, dated March, 1903, written to Miss Julia Gilman by Mary Chandler Lowell, i)erhaps the only young woman in America who has taken a tlegree in both medicine and law: "The other morning, when I stood in the court room and took the solemn oath of office of an attorney at law, my mind turned toward you. ... It was my good

fortune in early youth to have several excel- lent teachers, but I think that none played so important a part in moulding my character and inspiring within me a desire to press for- ward and make the most of my abilities as did you. . . . But for your W"ords of encouragement and cheer I might never have been al)le to hold, as I do to-day, certificates which entitle me to the privileges of both the medical and the legal profession."

Such letters give an insight into the motives which control these teachers. When Mi.ss Julia Gilman left South Boston, Mr. Anagnos, the director, jiaid a high tribute to her as "one of the most efficient and conscientious teachers ever emploj^ed by the Institution," and laid special emphasis on the way she had helped to "enlarge its ethical atmosphere to a very grati- fying extent."
