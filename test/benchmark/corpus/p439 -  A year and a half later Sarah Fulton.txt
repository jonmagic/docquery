" A year and a half later Sarah Fulton heard the alarm of Paul Revere as he 'crossed the bridge into Medford town,' and a few days after the place became the headquarters of General Stark's New Hampshire regiment. Then came the battle of Bunker Hill. All

day the people of Medfonl watched the battle with anxious hearts: many a son and brother were thereâ€” dying, maybe, just out of their reach. At sunset the wounded were brought into town, and a large open space by Wade's Tavern, between the bridge and South Street, was turneil into a field hospital. Surgeons were few, but the women did their l)est as mu'ses. Among them the steady nerves of Sarah Fulton made her a leader. One poor fellow had a bullet in his cheek, and she removed it. She almost forgot the circumstance until, years after, he came to thank her for her service.

" During the siege of Boston, detachments of British soldiers often came across the river under protection of their ships, .searching for fuel in Metlford. One day a loail of wood intended for the troops at Cambridge was ex- ])ected to come through town, and one of these bantls of soldiers was there before it. Sarah Fulton, knowing that the wooil would be lost unless something was done, and hoping that private jjroperty would be respecteel, sent her husband to meet the team, buy the load, and bring it home. He carried out the first part of the {programme, but on the way to the house he met the soldiers, wht) seizetl the wood. When his wife heard the story, she flung on a shawl and went in pursuit. Overtaking the })arty, she took the oxen by the horns ami turned them round. The men threatenetl to shoot her, but she .shouted ilefiantly, as she started her team, 'Shoot away!' Astonishment, ad- miration, and amusement were too much for the regulars, and they unconditionally sur- rendered.

"Soon after Major Brooks, later our hon- ored Governor, was given despatches by Gen- eral Washington which must be delivered in- side the enemy's lines. Late one night he came to John Fulton, knowing his patriotism and his intimate knowledge of Boston, and asked him to undertake the trust. He was not able to go, but his wife volunteered. Her offer was accepted. A long, lonely, and dan- gerous walk it was to the waterside in Charles- town, but she reached there in safety, and, finding a boat, rowed across the river. Cau- tiously making her way to the place she sought, she delivered her ilespatches, ami returned as

she had come. \\'heu the first streak of dawn appeared, she stood safe on her own door- stone. In recognition of her services General Washington visited her. It is said that, ac- cording to the fashion of the day, John Fulton, on this occasion, brewed a potation whose chief ingredient was the far-famed jiroduct of the town. The little silver-mounteil ladle was dipped in the steaming concoction, and the first glass from Mrs. Fulton's new punch- bowl was sipped by his Excellency. This was the proudest day of Sarah Fulton's life. The chair in which he sat and the punch-bowl and ladle were always sacred, and are still treas- ured by her descendants.
