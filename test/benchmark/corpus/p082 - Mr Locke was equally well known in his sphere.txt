Mr. Locke was equally well known in his sphere of intellectual activity. He preserved the family history by compiling and publish- ing "The Book of the Lockes."

As a girl, and indeed from eai'liest infancy, Grace had to contend with delicate healtli. In 1850 her parents moved to Boston, and, since all but the first five years of her life have

been passed in this city, she may be called a Bostonian. She was graduated from every grade of the Boston public schools, primary, grammar, high, and normal. In 1870 she became the wife of Henry M. Upham, son of Captain Will- iam and Margaret (Folger) Upham, of Nan- tucket. The Folgers, his maternal ancestors, were of the same family as the mother of Ben- jamin Franklin. Mr. I'pham, late of the firm of Damrell &amp; Upham, has recently retired from business, having been identified for thirty-six years with that ancient landmark of Boston, "The Old Corner Bookstore," which has borne his name. Thus by her marriage was another incentive given Mrs. Upham to use the talent inherited from her parents.

When she first began to write, she did not anticipate making authorship a j»rofession, and so abbreviated her name. But the instantane- ous success of her first book, "Little Miss Faith," published in 1894 by Lee &amp; Shepard, Boston, encouraged her to go on. In the same year "The Ban of the Golden Rod" was pub- lished by a New York house. Following these came "Little Daughter," 1895; "The Rosebud Club," 1896; "Queer Janet," 1897; "Told under the Cherry-trees," 1890; "Jessica's Triumph," 1901 — all published by Lee &amp; Shepard. In 1898 Little, Brown .t Co. issued " 'Twixt You and Me." She has now in jireparation the last of the "Janet Series" for children and a novel for their elders. The latter has b'^en urged upon Mrs. Upham by readers who have enjoyed her shoit stories, which have appeared at in- tervals in the current periodicals and maga- zines. Mrs. Upham says, however, that she shall alwaj's give her best strength to the young, who have been her most sincere friends from the first. Her stories are written with a purpose, the pui'pose of purifying and en- nobling the lives of children. And she has richly earned her title, "The Children's Friend." Many are the letters she has received from her youthful admirers, letters filled with such earn- est gratitude and appreciation that she counts herself rich indeed, .to have inspired them. That she might be sure of doing work uncolored and unbiassed by others in a similar line of literature, she has entirely abstained from reading juvenile books. This may, in a meas-

ure, account for the distinctive style which is all her own.

Mrs. Uphani's vivacity and warmth of heart make her a favorite, and, while not a club woman, she has a wide acquaintance with such. It is in patriotic societies that she feels her keenest interest, and she is a member of the following: Daughters of the American Revo- lution, Daughters of 1812, Society of May- flower Descendants, Huguenot Society of Amer- ica, belonging also to the Society of American Authors and Boston Authors' Society, and being an honorary Member of the League of American Penwomen and the Ladies' Physio- logical Institute.
