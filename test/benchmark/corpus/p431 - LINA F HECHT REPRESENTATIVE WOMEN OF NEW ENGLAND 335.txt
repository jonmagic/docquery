Born in Hainstadt, grand (Uichy of Baden, March 15, 1834, Jacol) H. Hecht was one of the eight children of Mr. and Mrs. Elias Hecht, who came to this country with their i)arents in 1848, and settled in Baltimore, Md.

He was president of the United Hebrew Benevolent Association of Boston, a director of the German Aid Society, the first president of the Elysium Club, and a member of the Bostonian Society and of the Boston Art Club.

In his will, dated January 30, I'Mi, Mr. Hecht made many public beciuests. To show the breadth of his sympathies and the varied nature of his charities, also his confidence in his wife's judgment ami in her fidelity to trusts, a few of its jirovisions may here be mentioned. A consideral)le sum, not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars, from the estate she was per- mitted to apply at her discretion, within a year from his death, for the benefit of worthy per- sons who were in need. Mrs. Hecht is also given the right to devote, if she sees fit, the income of fifty thousand dollars annually to the Hebrew Industrial School. Harvard Col- lege is to receive eventually the sum of ten thousand dollars as a scholarship fund, prefer- ably for students of Hebrew parentage, and a fund of five thousand dollars to be known as the Hecht fund, the income to be applied to the Schiff Semitic Museum. Among other be- quests may be named five thousand dollars each to the Massachusetts General Hospital anil A.si30ciated Charities of Boston; five hundred dollars each to the Benoth Israel Sheltering Home, the Boston Provident Association, the National Farm School, Philadelphia, and the Industrial School for Deformed and Crippled Children; three hundred dollars each to the Hebrew Ladies' Helping Hand Association, the Newsboys' Reading Room, the Charitable Burial Association, the Boston Y. M. C. A., and the Y. M. C. U.; one thousand dollars to the Boston Young Men's Hebrew Association; and two hundred dollars to the Salvation Army.

Mrs. Hecht is the honorar)' vice-president of the Jewish Publication Society of Phila- delphia and a vice-president of the Civil Service Reform As.sociation. She was vice- president of the National Council of Jewish Women, and is now the vice-president of the New England section of that organization. She has served for many years as a member of the board of the W'omen's Educational and Industrial Ihiion, a position in which her services have been greatly appreciated. Both the Hebrew Federated Charities and the As- sociated Charities of Boston are benefited by her active participation in their affairs. She has served on the Ijoard of the Public Bath Department of the city.

Asitle from personal donations, Mrs. Hecht has been zealous in raising money for worthy' causes, and the fairs and entertainments that she has organized have, through her own un- tiring efforts ami the enthusiasm she has aroused in others, brought in phenomenal sums.
