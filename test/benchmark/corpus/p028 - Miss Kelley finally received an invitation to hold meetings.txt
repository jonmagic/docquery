Miss Kelley finally received an invitation to hold meetings in Washington, Conn. She says of them: "The first meeting was well attended, and another was called for, then still another and another, each with deepening interest and larger attendance. When a fifth was pro- po.sed, as I had engagements elsewhere, I promised to return in two weeks and speak again. It may seem remarkable that no oppo- sition was manifested; but those who invited me were all members of the church, and Mr. Gunn was the superintendent of the Sabbath- school, and Mr. Piatt a sheriff of the county. . . . I was treated with much consitleration, receiv- ing hospitality from those who stood first and best. But, when I returned, lo, what a change! Mr. and Mrs. Gunn met me with sorrowful faces and told me that in my absence Mr. H., the minister, had preached a sermon from the text. Rev. ii. 20: 'I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel to teach and to seduce my servants.' . . .

He set forth the powers and artifices of Jezebel, her learning, her marvellous blandishments, with the neglect of the minister to forbid her preaching until she had acquired such an influ- ence that he daretl not interfere. Then Mr. H. charged that another Jezebel had arisen, and, with fascinations exceeding even those of her Scripture prototype, was aiming to entice and destroy this church. ... He added: 'Do any of you ask for evidence of her vile character? It needs no other evidence than the fact that in the face of the clearest commands of God, " IjCt your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permittetl unto them to speak," she comes here with brazen face, a servant of Satan in the garb of an angel of light, and tramples this connnand under her feet.' This is the purport of his discourse as reported to me.

"My friends invited me to go with them to the weekly prayer-meeting that afternoon. We hoped, though with little faith, to have an opportunity for my friend to say a few words in reply to the Sunday's sermon. But no one was allowed to speak except by the minister's invitation, and the meeting was soon closed. We stood near the door as the i)eople passed out. With one exception, not one of those whom I had met on my first visit, not even those who had hospitably entertained me, gave me a hand or a look, but all passed me as if I hatl been a block. I doubt not that many of the members of that church thanketl Mr. H. for his timely warning, by which they were saved from being led to death and hell. At my lect- ure that evening few were present, and tho.se mainly from surrounding towns. I went to my chamber that night, but not to sleep. In agony of prayer and tears, my cry was, 'Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! ' My anguish was not because of anything per- sonal to myself, but because I was thus cut off from the people who might rise up for the defence of the slave. The friends at whose house I was stood by me nobly, but we all saw that nothing more could be done at that time.
