John Murray Leland was a highly respected citizen of Somerville for more than fifty years. His wife Sophronia was of Maine ancestry. They had five chiUh'en, namely: Albert A.; Arabella, who died in infancy; Anna M. (now Mrs. Bailey); EllaF.: and Frank E.

Anna M. Leland was educated in the public schools of Somerville, and graduated from the Somerville High School, being one of the first girls to take the full classical, or college pre- paratory course of stuily in that school. Liv- ing within sight of Harvard College, it was but natural that she should incline toward a col- lege education; but fate beckoned in another direction, and she was induced to accept the position of teacher in the public schools of her native city, soon becoming the principal of the Jackson School. She afterward hail a position in the Harvard Grammar School in Cambridge, which she held until lier marriage. She was very successful as a teacher, her great love for children, her sympathy with their needs, and her enthusiasm for her cho.sen work endearing her to parents and pupils alike.
