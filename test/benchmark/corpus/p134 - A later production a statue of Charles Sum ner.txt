Mi.ss \Vhitney took up her residence in Bo.s- ton in 1872. For a number of years she had her home and her studio at 92 Mount Vernon Street.

rish, was a merchant in Newburyport, Mass. He was bom in Thornton, N.H., in 1791, a son of Stephen and Betsy (Gerrish) Smith. The Gerrish family, to which his mother and his wife belonged, was founded by Captain William' Gerrish, who came to Newbury, Mass., with Percival Lowle (Lowell). Stephen Smith, father of Foster, was a soldier of the Revolu- tion. His name is on the Revolutionary Rolls of New Hampshire.

Baroness Posse's maternal grandparents were John and Catherine (Moore) Ballou (name legally changed from Bullough), the grand- mother belonging to the Moore family of Sud- bury, Mass., dating from early colonial times. John Ballou was son of Joseph and Abigail (Symmes) Bullough, of Newton, Mass. Joseph Bullough is spoken of in Vinton's "Symmes Memorial" as "a native of England and a man of large property." Abigail Symmes, whom he married in 1774 (Mnton), was daughter of Zechariah^ Synnnes, of Charlcstown. Her father was son of the Rev. Thomas' Symmes and great-grandson of the Rev. Zechariah' Symmes (a graduate of Emmanuel College, Cambridge University), who came to New England in 1634, and was for many years pastor of the church in Charlestown.

Rose M. Smith was educated in the Newbury- port public schools and at the State Normal School in Salem. After her graduation she taught Latin and French in a fashionable pri- vate school in Philadelphia until her marriage. Possessing an excellent contralto voice, she gave much time to music, and studied under leading teachers in this country and abroad. While in Philadelphia she sang in one of the church choirs, and after removing to Boston sang in one of the churches until 1900. During the summer of 1885 she travelled in Europe for pleasure, and it was in England that she first met Baron Posse, who was on his way to Amer- ica. The friendship then begun was continued in this country, and in 1887 they were married and settled in Boston.
