" Verite sans ))eur" is Miss Benneson's motto, adopted when she was eighteen yeai's old and so faithfully adhered to that her fi'iends, seeing it even on her office; walls, have come to asso- ciate it with her name. Following truth with- out fear and seeing the best that is in every

one, she has become to others a constant stim- ulus to new and high achievement. They can- not bring into her atmosjjhere what is trifling or degrading. She ojjens to them a larger life, helping them by showing them how to help themselves. Her secret of happy living is to convert difhculties into blessings by making them contribute to self-mastery ami spiritual development.
