fonl. She is a poet of deep emotion, of far- reaching vision, of sjjlendid power."

But beyond all the literary graces and achieve- ments of Mrs. Spofford — and it is a pleasant note to close with — this same gifted contem- porary and intimate friend appreciates " her noble womanhood, her unselfish devotion to her family and her friends, her loyalty to all high and noble ideals."

EAMMA ELIZABITH BROWN, artist I and writer, was born in Concord, N.H., J October 18, 1847, daughter of John Frost and Elizabeth (Evans) Brown. Her father had no sons, his brother Hemy (also deceased) never married, and, her gran&lt;l- father Brown having been an only son, Miss Brown is the last of her line to bear the family name. As stated by the late Henry Brown, who was a genealogist, this family of Brown in New England is of German origin and the early spelling of the name was Braun.

Through her [laternal grandmother, Mrs. Susannah Frost Brown, Miss Brown traces her descent from Eihuund Frost, Ruling Elder of the church in Cambridge, Mass. Elder Frost, said to have lieen son of John Frost, of Ipswich, England, came over in the ship "Great Hope" in 1635, and was made freeman at Cambridge, March 3, 1636. He died in July, 1672. In his will, which was probated in October following, he left bequests to his widow Reana (his .second wife), each of his eight children, something to the new college (Harvard) then buililiiig at Cambridge, and to George Alcock, a student. Much time was spent by Mr. Henry Brown in England, look- ing up the records of the Frost family.

Mi.ss Brown's father, John Frost Brown, for many years a leading bookseller in Concord, N.H., was an ardent lover of beauty, whether in nature or art. During her girlhood, as she took long outdoor tiamps with him, he taught her to note the changing i)eauties of sky and land and sea, which in later years she has been .so skilful in reproducing on canvas. During his bu.sy life he collected a large library of val- uable books. He was a givat reader himself.

and he directecl her reading, which dwelt mostly on outdoor themes and stories of goklen deeds in ancient and modern history. This reading has borne fruit in the many interesting volumes to which Miss Brown's name is attached.

Her mother, Elizabeth Evans, was also of English descent, but her family record shows more practical business men than scholars. She herself hatl great executive ability and an energetic temperament. Her parents were Ar- temas and Margaret (Sargent) . Evans. The latter, Miss Brown's grandmother, lived to be more than a hundred years old, and when she was ninety-two had four sisters living who were over ninety. Only two of the five, how- ever, reached the century mark, and none of the later generation showed any striking lon- gevity.

Miss Brown has made a name for herself with botli pen and brush. Well-trained in the Concord schools, she was always a student at home and a keen observer as she travelled. She is a versatile woman, and one turns with delight from her jiaintings to her histories, her poems, her clever illustrating.
