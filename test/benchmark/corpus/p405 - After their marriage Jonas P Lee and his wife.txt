After their marriage Jonas P. Lee and his wife Annie resided in Hallowell. Their daugh- ter Sarah E. was educated in the excellent schools of that town, remaining there till her marriage, October 14, 1851, to Francis Taft Sargent, a merchant of New York City, and who was directly descended from Governor Winthrop, the first Governor of Massachusetts, and for whom one of their sons was named, being given the family name of Winthrop Otis Sargent. Mr. and Mrs. Sargent made their home in Brooklyn, and united with the Pres- byterian church of that city. Two children were born to them there, and their first great grief came in the death of their beautiful and most interesting daughter at two years of age. On account of the ill health of Mr. Sar- gent, after five years' residence in Brooklyn they removed to Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas. Three sons were added to their family in Nassau, and for a time health seemed restored in that salubrious climate; but the

seeds of death still lingered, and Mr. Sargent died suddenly, September 20, 1860, of hem- orrhage of the lungs. After his death the widow, with her four little ones, retu,rned to her native land, arriving in New York on the day of the first battle of Bull Run, when our Northern men met for the first time their Southern brothers in mortal combat and were defeated. Mrs. Sargent with her children went inunediately to Farmington, Me., where dear kinsfolk welcf)me(l her to the new home. When her two younger sons passed on to the Father in heaven, she went with their precious remains to lay them beside the dearly beloved in Greenwood Cemetery, in Brooklyn, N.Y., expecting her brother. Colonel Samuel Perry Lee, to meet her there. As he could not leave his post of duty with the Army of the Potomac at this most critical period of the war, when the reliels were threatening Wa.shington, with only three miles between the two armies, lie recjuested his sister with her son to visit him. She went immediately to Washington, to find it one vast hospital, with one hundred thou- sand sick and wounded soldiers in and around the city, the Capitol itself being crowdetl. As she was informed by a friend, one of the prin- cipal medical directors of the army, the Patent Office and public buildings, all the churches, and many temporary hospitals were filled with the sick and dying. W^e had had very few battles, but for many months our army had besieged Richmond, the redel capital, encamp- ing in and near the dreadful Chickahominy swamps, filled with malaria, destroying the health of our .soldiers, throwing out of combat thousands more than the most fiercely con- tested battles, as the Southerners well under- stood. While in Washington, Mrs. Sargent witnessed a review of this same Army of the Potomac, with its decimated ranks and worn and faded uniforms, in evidence of their sail experience and in contrast with the multitude of new recruits, full of j^atriotism and strength, who were being constantly hurried forward to fill the places of these who had fallen in defence of our beloved country.
