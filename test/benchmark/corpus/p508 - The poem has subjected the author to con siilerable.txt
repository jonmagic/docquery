The poem has subjected the author to con- siilerable amusing annoyance, for, some years after it was written, it appeared in The Chris- tian at Work as the production of a man in Ohio, who sought to establish his claim by setting forth some personal details connected with its origin. It also apjjearetl in a published collection of poems in the West and credited to a Western woman. Later on a London lit- erary journal published a strongly satirical article in regard to its pretended American authorship, strangely confounding the poem with the familiar hynm of "Toplady." The poem by Mrs. Moore describes the various emotions awakened by singmg "Rock of Ages"

— in the girl, in "lips grown aged," and "over the coffin lid"; and only neglect to read the verses could explain the critic's mistake. Mrs. Moore contributed for several years occasional short stories and verses to various magazines and newspapers, and on one occasion entered the lists in competition for the prize offered by the Ymdh's Companion for the best story for girls. There were seven thousand com- petitors that year, and Mrs. Moore received the first prize of five hundred dollars.

In 1880 Lothrop &amp; Co., Boston, published her volume of verses entitled "Songs of Sun- shine and Shadow," which has passed through two editions.

She must be clas.sed among the poets of nature. A list of her themes would reveal this, for she sings of trees and flowers, brooks and rills, of night-fall, summer and winter, and the voice of spring. The much quoted words of Wordsworth, speaking of himself, would truly apply to the author of "Songs of Sunshine and Shadow": —

The glory and the freshness of a dream."

How clearly this is revealed in the poem, "To a Flower Painter," one of the best of the collection, through which breathes a desire to render immortal the varied beautiful forms of field and forest! —

"If I had all an artist's vi^ondrous cunning,

The magic of the painter's glowing art, All the wild flowers of limpid brooklets running,

All blossoms of the field and wood a part — The buttercup with disc of sunny yellow,

The l)los.s()m of the wind-flower frail and fair, The honeyed clover that the brown bees fellow.

The columbine that sways the summer air — Pd paint them all on tablet, panel, (lortal, And render them immortal.

"I'd whisper to the lily, standing stately

In fair, unconscious grace. Or to the sweet wild rose ablu.shing greatly,

'Bend down, O queen, bend down a little space, That I may read the beauty of thy face ! '

"And I would wander far in forest reaches,

Where wild-wood vines entangle woodland ways,

To find the pulpit whence the brown .lack preaches His silent sermons through the summer days.

"And I would seek the crimson cup-moss, growing In shadow'd nook.s, and by the brooklet's brink The fronded fern, the scarlet lily glownig
