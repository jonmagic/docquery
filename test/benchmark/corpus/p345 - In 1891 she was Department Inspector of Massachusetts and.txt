In 1891 she was Department Inspector of Massachusetts, and at the annual convention the following year was elected Department

President. She immediately sought to famil- iarize, herself with all the numerous detads of the office, and, possessing unusual execu- tive ability, conducted a very able adminis- tration.

In her address presented at its close she said in part: "My entire time has been given to the service, and I have endeavored to per- form the varied and responsd)le duties in a just and conscientious manner. In my first gen- eral order, issuetl February 12, the assignment of my office hours at headquarters in Boston was announced; but two afternoons each week have not been sufficient to complete the duties given to my charge. Members and com- mittees seeking advice and information, re- ports to be examined, correspondence requir- ing immediate attention, copy to be furnished the printer, and other tluties have required my presence many days at headquarters. Whether in Boston or at my home in Fall River, every day has been fully occupied with the work of the Department; and with few ex- ceptions my evenings have been devoted to its executive or public duties.

"I have issued nine general orders, thirty- eight special orders, three circular letters anti other official documents, and have written several thousand letters. I have accepted all invitations to represent our order at gather- ings held by posts or corps, wherever possi- ble. By special request I have personally instituted four corjis â€” namely, at Bourne, Williamstown, Marshtield Hills, and Weymouth; have assisted at the institution of corps at New Bedford, Lee, Warehani, Ijeicester, and Boston; and it has been my pleasant duty to install the officers of nine corps. By invitation of the president of the New England Chau- tauqua Assembly I presented a brief history of our order at the Grand Army Day exercises held at South Framinghani July 25, under the auspices of the Assembly."

The following resolution offered by Mrs. Deane was adopted by the convention: "That a plan be inaugurated for the establishing of a home in Massachusetts for the destitute widows and orphans of ovir veterans and for dependent army nurses on oiu" roll. That the home be dedicated as a memorial of the pa-

triotism of the women of Massachusetts iluring the Civil War and under the management ol the Department of Massachusetts, \\'oman's Relief Corps."

Being appointed chairman of a connnittee to obtain a fund for this purpose, Mrs. Deane issued an appeal for contributions. In re- sponse to tiie appeal considerable sums were received by the committee, but it was deemed axlvisable to render immediate relief to those in need rather than to wait for the erection of a building. They have therefore been cared for in their own homes and received continu- ous aid, with friendly visits and encourage- ment.

Mrs. Deane's portrait hangs upon the walls of Department headquarters, placed there by the contributions of the corps presidents of 1892. A large and haniLsomely bound album was presented tier at the same time, which containetl the letters expressing the regard of the tlonors. E. R. Hopkins Corps, No. 155, of Williamstown, has placed her picture in its Grand Army Hall.
