His wife Lavina came from the Allen family of Dover, Mass., but was born in Bowdoinham, Me., her father, Hezekiah Allen, having moved there and engaged in ship-building. Lavina Allen was sent to Roxbury, Mass., at the age of twelve, to continue her studies, and after leaving school she made her home in the family of an uncle, the Rev. Morrill Allen, settled over the First Parish (now Unitarian) of Pembroke. A few years of school-'teaching with the low wages of that period followed, and then, at the age of twenty-two, she became, as narrated above, the wife of a woollen manufacturer. Industry and economy were the rule of the household. The record shows the births of

Lavina A., the subject of this sketch, born May 20, 1836, and named for her mother, was the youngest child. It was a very small bit of humanity, weighing less than six pounds, whose eyes then opened to earth life.

It was the habit of this teacher to join in the games and sports of the pupils. Many will never forget one summer da}', when, the rain having poured for hours, and the sun just struggled out, the door of the school-room was softly opened, and the three committee-men stood amazed to find the teacher with eyes blinded and a brisk game of blind man's buff in active progress.

She simply said, "Now rece.ss is over, let the committee see that we can work as well as play." In later years this same physician, the late Asa Millett, M.D., recalled an incident
