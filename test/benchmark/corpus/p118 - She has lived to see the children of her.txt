She has lived to see the children of her earlier classes develop in noble men and women, several of the number having distinguished themselves in literature, science, and art.

The strongest testimony to her abilit\ as an educator is given in these results of char- acter and achievement, which in a special way have marked Miss Rust's work in Boston and elsewhere in her Froebel School and Kinder- garten Normal Classes. It is just aiid right, however, that those of a later generation who

now reap from fruitful fields should acknowl- edge their debt to the pioneer kindergartners who prepared the ground and planted the good seed.

MARY ELIZA KNOWLES, Past Na- tional Chaplain of the Woman's Re- lief Corps, was born in Boston, February 14, 1847. Daughter of Jacob and P'mmeline (Reed) Clones and one of a large family of children, .she was brought up at the North End, in a locality rich in his- toric and patriotic associations, her home being in the vicinity of Christ Church ami Copp's Hill, and was educated at the Hancock School. After her graduation she made a special study of elocution, of which she has been a successful teacher. She is also a popular public reatler. The marriage of Mary E. Clones and Zoeth Rich Knowles took place June 14, 1866.

Mrs. Knowles's father was the third Jacob Clones in tlirect line residing in Boston. His grandfather Clones died in 1799. His father, Jacob Clones, 2d, who married Phebe Ann Low, daughter of William Low, died in 1815. W'illiam Low, great-grandfather of Mrs. Knowles, was a Revolutionary soldier, belong- ing to a company of militia that was called into service at the time of the Lexington alarm, April 19, 1775.

Mrs. Knowles is a charter member of Abra- ham Lincoln Corps, No. 39, auxiliary to Post No. 1 1 , Charlestown. She was installed April 22, 1884, as its first Senior ^'ice-President, and in January, 1885, accepted the position of Presi- dent, serving continually in office and on com- mittees. Her first participation in a Depart- ment Convention was in 1886, when she was invited to present a baimer procured by con- tribution from members. The pleasing manner in which she performed this duty made such a favorable impression that she was elected Department Chaplain, and re-elected in 1887. In her second annual report as Chaplain she reconnnended that a special service in honor of the unknown dead and of deceased army nurses be })repare(l for use on Memorial Day.

Mrs. Knowles was elected Department Junior Vice-Presitlent in 1888, and m this capacity

In 1889 she was chosen Depart- ment Senior Vice-President, and in February, 1890, received the highest office in the Depart- ment of Massacliusetts, that of Department President. It was in August of this year that the National Encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic was held in Boston, antl many extra duties devolved upon her. She was a vice-president of the general committee and a member of the executive committee of arrange- ments for the National Convention, also chair- man of the reception committee and an active worker on the committee on finance, press, and invitation. In her general order to the corps some time previous she said: "This year prom- ises to be the most important one in the history of this Department. This dear old State of ours will be honored above all others during the month of August. From all parts of the country the veterans of the G. A. R. and our sisters of the W. R. C. will come to us. Prove to them that the Mother Department of our order can be as royal in her hospitality as she is generous and tender in her care and protec- tion of her country's defenders."
