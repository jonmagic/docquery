On June 10, 1805, Governor Caleb Strong appointed Ebenezer Cheney, Esq., Brigadier-general of the First Brigade in the Third Division of the militia of this Commonwealth of Massachusetts. General Cheney was a Representative to the General Court from 1808 to 1817. He was a member of the committee of that body which produced the remonstrance against the Em- bargo Act in 1808, and it is thought that he may have written the document. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Revision Con- vention in 1820. He was very active in the incorporation of the South Burial-ground in Newton in 1802 and in the erection of the new meeting-house in 1803-1805. He died February 27, 1853.

He was a prominent member of the Masonic order. His father, Jacob B. Weth- erell, was connected with the firm of Grover &amp; Baker, manufacturers of the well-known .sewing machines of that name, as superintendent, from the first establishment of the firm to the time of his death.

Mrs. Wetherell has always been interested in church, charitable, and patriotic work. In the early ])art of the Civil War she helped in sending supplies to the soldiers at the front.

She joined the Warren Avenue Baptist Church of Boston, but transferred her member- shi]) to the Tremont Temple church, where she was for many years actively ide'ntihed with all its branches of work. She is now a helper in the social and charitable enterprises of the church of the same denomination at Field's Corner, Dorchester, where she is a resident.
