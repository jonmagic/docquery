At the call of Governor Wolcott, May 3, 1898, upon the breaking out of the Spanish War, for the formation of a State soldiers' relief association, the chapter at once took the lead in organizing a Springfield auxiliary, and kept energetically to the work until the receiving of the soldiers on their retuin home, August 27. A memorial tablet to the Spring- field soldiers, to be placed in the city library, was the last act of the Springfielil auxiliary, whose foremost officers were members of the chapter.

In 1899 the chapter established ami furnished at no inconsiderable expense headquarters for its board of officers in connection with an assembly hall. The whole number of mem- bers enrolled is four hundretl and twenty- three, and the present membership (April, 1904) is two hundred and seventy-five.

Mrs. Calkins was one of the board of man- agers of the Springfield Soldiers' and Sailors' Aid Society at the time of the Spanish War.

In 1895 the State primary school, through the policy of the State to place its young wards in families, had become so depleted that it was abolished and the property turned over to a board of trustees appointed by Governor Wolcott for the establishment of a hospital for epileptics. Mrs. Calkins was appointed one of the trustees of the hospital, and is still in its service.

Mrs. Calkins is a member of the Springfield Women's Club, an honorary member of the

Teachers' Club, and a member of the Rama- pogue Historical Society. Her church mem- bership is with the First Congregational So- ciety.
