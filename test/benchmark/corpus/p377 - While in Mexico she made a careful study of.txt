While in Mexico she made a careful study of the people and their customs, ami furnished a' syndicate of nine papers with letters during her entire stay in that charming country. Mr. Frazar continued to fail, antl after eight years of heroic suffering died in 1896 in his native State, Massachusetts.

In 1889 Mrs. Frazar started, as a regular

business, the managing ixiid conducting of European parties. She says, "Experience has shown me that Americans neetl to see Europe carefully, particularly where the in- fluence of things seen and studied shall be for the benefit of our own country." In this connection she encourages journalistic work among her patrons, several of whom have achieved therein great success. Rooks of de- cided merit have grown out of this work.

The whole scheme of travel is carried out as if planned for an individual. The growth of her business has made assistance necessary, and several young men of culture and travel are now helping in it. The business is de- cidedly educational, and through interest in travel and the attending study of art and literature Mrs. Frazar has accunmlated a rich store of knowledge, which makes her a most fascinating and instructive lecturer. Appearing in this capacity before numerous cluiis and societies, she has formed strong friendships among club women, and has become an active member of several clubs. Two years ago she was elected president of the Daughters of Maine Club of Somerville, which is made up of four hundretl women from the Pine Tree State, and whose work is purely literary. This office she still holds. At the present time she is on the editorial staff of the National Magazine of lioston and of the Somerville Journal, finding time also to do much work for the Boston Tran- script.

Mrs. Frazar dwells with much pleasure on a certain incident in her life, which grew out of her own stvirdy sense of justice. At one time certain people came to this covmtry from Italy to give addresses upon the political conditions of that country. She felt that gross misrepresentations were made, and came out with a vigorous jjrotest, in the lioston Transcript, correcting statements, and urging that no country has the right to interfere with what another country considers its depart- ments of political justice. The Italians of Boston appreciated this and gave a reception to Mrs. Frazar, at which she was publicly thanked for her generous sympathy, and was presented with a tribute of flowers tied

with the Italian colors. These flowers were the gift of one thousand Italians, each of whon\ contributed one cent, this small sum having been purposely fixed so that the ]ioorest might share in the offering.

Mrs. Frazar has two sons: Gerard, the commercial editor of the Globe, and Amherst IXirell, who is connected with the Swift Wool Company.

Whether pacing the deck of an Atlantic steamer as one of her jiatrons, or interrupting her at her editorial duties, or making known to her some need of charity, one finds in Mrs. Frazar a symjiathetic, genuine interest in the welfare of others. Perhaps it is this unselfishness that makes her so universally beloved.
