to do with it, unless she could carry on the school in the building as first agreed. With their plans her hands would be completely tied, as it was upon a financial basis rather than an educational, and her reputation as a teacher of these principles was far more to her than the salary offered.

At this decision of hers, generous offers were made by parents to retain her, saying they would make up the deficiency in salary if she would but remain; but Miss Rust, while grate- ful to these patrons for their sympathy and kind offers, said she saw no reason for accept- ing presents, it being with her a matter of principle ; as, under the proposed conditions, she would be unable to make it the model school she desired, or add to it her Kindergarten Normal Classes.

About this time an urgent appeal came to Miss Rust from a Western city to accept the position of head instructor in a Kindergarten Normal Class, which had been started by the Free Kindergarten Association, and also as instructor in one of the free kindergartens, numbering one hundred children, started that autumn, both of which she accepted. It is a great pleasure to her to refer to this large work with the less fortunate little ones. She was also very successful with the Normal Class. But the climate of that city, with its strong lake winds, was too severe for Miss Rust, and she was suddenly stricken down by pneumonia, for several days her life hanging upon a thread. Upon her recovery she was unable to resume her work there, and felt the need of returning to Boston, which she did. After a short rest she was advised to go to an inland . city, and having an opportunity to purchase in Worcester a private school, of chil- dren from three to twelve years of age, she accepted, naming it the Froebel School, at the same time starting a Kindergarten Normal Class, being urgetl to do this by a member of the State Board of Education, as there was no such Training School in Worcester. Her work there also was very successful, graduating large classes, employing some of our best pecial lecturers for the instruction of the classes as well as for the graduation exercises. Miss Rust, in addition to her school work in Worces-

ter, gave talks before different clubs in that city and elsewhere.

After several years of successful work in Worcester, Miss Rust, being closely confined by the amount of labor required in her schools, realized that she was shut off from many things with which she needed to keep in touch in order to grow. She therefore felt that she must return to her former home, Boston, where she would have all desired advantages, and here re-establish herself in her Kindergarten Normal Classes.

Although urged by former pupils, being now parents, to again organize a kindergarten and school for children, she has decided to give her time to the instruction of Normal Classes only and to talks before clubs. Miss Rust has now returned to this city for her permanent home, and has her Kindergarten Normal Classes well established at the New Century Building. She was a member of the American Froebel Union started in Boston by Miss Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. This became the Kindergar- ten Department of the National Etlucational As- sociation. At this time s}ie was urged by Miss Peabody to join the New England Woman's Club. She is a member of the Eastern Kin- dergarten Association, the National Education Association, the International Kindergarten Union, and the AVomen's Educational and Industrial Union. She was formerly a member of the Worcester Woman's Club, and helped to organize the Women in Council Club, Rox- bury, Mass. In all the years since she started as a Kintlergartner, she has never lowered her high standard, nor hesitntetl to make any sacri- fice demanded by the cause to who.se advance- ment her life is consecrated. She belongs to Trinity (Episcopal) Church, Boston.
