Mr. James is the author of a vohime en- titled "Memories of the Civil War." In it he says: "I have often wondered how it hap- pened that I, born of Quaker stock on my mother's side, should have had such a natural leaning toward scenes of adventure and con- flict. It may well have been that I inherited it from the paternal side of the liouse." He adds, speaking of his grandfather, Joim James, Sr. : "During my childhood I often listened to his tales of warfare and l)loodslu&gt;d, and longed to be a man, that I miglit hglit and avenge the wrongs inflicted on my devoted country in its earlier days. As I read of the War of the Revolution, I wished that I might have lived in tho!«e stirring days and done my part in creating the American nation."

Mr. James desired to enlist among the first volunteers of the Union after the fall of Fort Sumter, but his father would n(jt then consent. He enlisted November 2, 1861, just after his twentieth birthday, in Company B, First Battalion, afterward the Thirty- second Massachusetts Infantry. He was mustered into the United States .service No- vember 27, 1861, and on December 3 was sent with his company to Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, to guard piisoners of war, among them being General Buckner, Commodore Barron, Commissioners Mason and Slidell, and the Mayor and Chief of Police of Baltimore.

On May 25 Company B left Fort Warren for Washington. On July 4 the battalion of which this company was a part was assigned to the brigade of General Charles Griffin, division of General Morell, in Fitz John Por- ter's conmiand, afterward known as the Fifth Army Corps. Mr. James was engaged in thirty-eight battles — Antietam, I'^redericks- burg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Mine Run, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, the Wilder- ness, and others. He was commissioned Sergeant in February, 1864, was wounded in a skirmish on the Boydton i)lank road March 30, 1865, and was in the Artn(&lt;ry Square Hospital in Washington from April 2 to May 26, when he was transferred to White Hall,
