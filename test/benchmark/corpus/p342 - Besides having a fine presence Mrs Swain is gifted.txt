EUNICE DRAPER-KINNEY, M.D., who has attained a gratifying success in her ]3rofession and in educational work, was born in Southampton, York County, N.B., daughterof James and Catherine (Schriver) Draper.

She is a great-grand-daughter of Isaac Draper, an Englishman who settled in Ireland in the first half of the eighteenth century, and en- gaged there in manufacturing industries. He was for a time very successful, owning several linen factories and over fifty houses, but was completely ruined by the invention of the spinning-jenny in 1767.

His son, James Draper, Sr., born May 22, 1781, was married October 22, 1814, in the cathedral chui-ch of St. Finbarr, in the liberties of the city of Cork, and according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England and Ireland, to Eliza Homan, who came, it is said, of a long paternal ancestry dating from the time of William the Conqueror. The Homans in general were a tall and spare race, the Norman blood evidently predominating, while the Smiths (her maternal ancestors) were large and heavy, most of the men being six feet or more in height.

James Draper, Sr., after losing all his prop- erty owing to the rapid change in industrial conditions, migrateil to New Brunswick. Here for some years his wife supported the family by keeping a ])rivate school. In course of time they attained to more comfortable circum- stances, though not to wealth, and resided for many years in the country of their adoption. James Draper, Sr., died February 9, 1866, and his wife Eliza on February 5, 1872, when eighty- three years old. They are buried at South- ampton, York County, near the St. John River.

James Draper, Jr., son of James, Sr., and Eliza Draper, an&lt;l father of Dr. Kinney, learned the baker's trade, wliich, however, he aban-

donecl at the age of twenty-oae to become a pioneer farmer anil lumberman. He was pos- sessed of considerable inventive talent, and ex- hibited at the Centennial Exposition at Phila- delphia a vessel entirely of his own construc- tion. The house in which he died, at Brooke Station, Stafford County, Va., October 2S, 1877, is said to have been the one in which Mrs. E. D. N. Southworth wrote ''The Hidden Hand." He was buried at Fredericksburg, Va.

His wife, Catherine Schriver, to whom he was married Novemi)er i;^, 1S51, was partly of Dutch ancestry, her paternal grandparents coming to America from Amsterdam, Holland. In this immigration four l)r()thers were con- cerned, two of whom — Tobaldo, or Baltus, as he was sometimes called (Dr. Kinney's great- grandfather), and Nathaniel — fought as loyal- ists for England's cause in the Revolutionary \\'ar. In one battle or skirmish of that war Tobaldo Schriver nai'rowly escaped death, a bullet hitting a button of his coat over the breast. After the war Nathaniel returned to Amsterdam. Tobaldo and his son Abraham became pioneer farmers in New Brunswick, having been assigned a large tract of forest land as the reward of their loyalty. Of the other two brothers, both of whom espoused the cause of the colonists, all trace has been lost. Cath- erine Schriver Draper died December 13, 1S66, and is buried at Southampton, York County, N.B. Her mother was Eunice Hillman, a daughter of Tristram and Angel (Lindup) Hill- man, English immigrants in New Brunswick, who resided at Southampton and at Canter- bury. The grandfather, Tristram Hillman, who was a sea captain, lived to the great age of one hundred and six years.
