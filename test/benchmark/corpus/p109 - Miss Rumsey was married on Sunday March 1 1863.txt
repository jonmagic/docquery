Miss Rumsey was married on Sunday, March 1, 1863, to Mr. John Allen Fowle. The cere- mony was performed by the Rev. Alonzo H. Quint, Chaplain of the Second Massachusetts Regiment and pastor of the Congregational Church, Jamaica Plain, Mass., where Mr. Fowle attended. The bride and bridegroom were leaders of the Capitol Choir, which furnished the music for the Sunday services established in the House of Representatives in 1862; and their work, which had given them a national reputation, was appreciated by their friends in Congress. Representatives' Hall in the Cap- itol was offered them, and the announcement that the wedding would take place there re-

sulted in an attendance of four thousand people. President Lincoln, who had signified his intention of being present, but was unex- pectedly detained, sent a magnificent basket of flowers.

Mr. Fowle was born April 4, 1826, son of George Makepeace and Margaret L. (Eaton) Fowle. He is a descendant in the seventh gen- eration of George Fowle, who was born in Scot- land in 1610, and was admitted a freeman in Concord, Mass., in 1632. He has been a dry- goods and wool merchant in Boston since 1855, with the exception of some years after the Civil War, when they lived in Brooklyn, N.Y. They were active in the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher's church. In Dorchester they are interested in the Pilgrim Congregational Church. Mr. Fowle is a member of the Dorchester Historical Soci- ety and the Improvement Association. Of the " Bungalow," the summer home of Mr. and Mrs. Fowle at North Scituate, a newspaper corre- spondent has said, "Not to have known the ' Bungalow ' is to have missed one of the quaint- est nooks on the South Shore."

The home of Mr. and Mrs. Fowle in Dorches- ter contains many valuable relics. "There on the wall is an old flag with its thirteen stars, which saw service in the War of 1812 as well as in the Civil War. Here over the case is a Con- federate flag, one of the first captured, and pre- sented to Mrs. Fowle by Admiral Foote, now intertwined with the stars and stripes. Among other relics are a Washington plate and a china saucer, both of which were presented to Mrs. Fowle by Aunt Sally Norris, who was a slave in the family of General Lee; some pieces of shell taken from the battle-field; an autograph album containing the names of thousands of soldiers; several letters from S. F. Smith, the author of 'America'; one from Oliver Wendell Holmes, with his additional verse to the 'Star- spangled Banner'; a directory of the soldiers and the hospitals, issued by Mr. Fowle in Wash- ington." Mrs. Fowle has the writing-desk which was sent her from Dorchester and which she used during the war; an old chair made of hardtack boxes used in camp of the Fourth Delaware Battery; also a melodeon, useil in camp, ho.spital, and library; and many other interesting anil valuable souvenirs of those
