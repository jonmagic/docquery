The Clark family of Winterport is one of the very oldest and most respected of the town, Lemuel Clark, Sr., having come there from Kittery nearly one hundred and fifty years ago. The original farm of the progenitor of the family is now owned and occupied by his great-grandson.

]\Irs. Packard's father was a sea-captain, engaged mostly in the West India trade, but also visiting foreign ports. Two of his brothers served in the War of 1812. Mrs. Packard's mother, born in 1812, was daughter of .John, Jr., and Sally (Crosby) Brown, of Belfast, Me. John Brown, Sr., removed from Londonderry, N.H., in 1773. He had been an officer in the Provincial army in the French antl Indian War. He was one of the first board of selectmen of Belfast, and is said to have been a man of "great vigor, energy, and honesty." He died in LS17, aged eighty-two years. His son, John, Jr., born in 1763, died in 1824 (History of Belfast). Both father and son were mem- bers of the Committee of Inspection and Safety during the struggle for Ainerican independence, and both rendered valuable service to the infant country. John Brown, Sr., was one of three men who alone of all the settlement re- fused to take the oath of allegiance to Great Britain when the British fleet appeared in Penobscot Bay in 1779, preferring to sacrifice all his possessions, which he did, but they were restored to him in 1783.

woman," was born in 1774, the daughter of Simon and Sarah (Sewall) Crosby. Her mother, great-grandmother of Mrs. Packard, was daugh- ter of Nicholas antl Mehitable (Storer) Sewall, of York, Me., and sister of Stephen Sewall, the learned professor of Hebrew at Harvard Uni- versity in the latter part of the eighteentli century. Nicholas Sewall was son of Johii^ (Henry' ') and nephew of SamueP Sewall, the distinguished Judge Sewall of colonial times.

Lemuel Clark was a man of intense loyalty to his country, but was too old to enlist in the Civil War of 1861-65. He sent two of his sons to the front, one of whom returned, the other being killed at Antietam.

His daughter Helen was reared in an atmos- phere of patriotism, and was but a school-girl when she began to work for the soldiers. vShe scraped lint, knitted socks, packed bo.xes of comforts, and after the war was over raised money from various entertainments for the benefit of the soldiers. When only fifteen years old she went about the outlying dis- tricts of Winterport, canvassing for provisions for the soldiers' fair to be held in her native town. After her graduation from the high school she continued her studies for a time at a boarding-school for girls.

John Alvin A. Packard, to whom she was married in 1867, served as a Lieutenant in the Fifth Maine Regiment in the Civil War, and had an honorable record as a brave soldier. He participated in all the battles of the Army of the Potomac, from Bull Hmi to Gettysburg. One week after Gettysbiu-g, while leading his company in an engagement, he was wounded by a bullet, which passed through his body and lodged in a tree. He resigned the fol- lowing November, but it was thirteen months before the wound was healetl. For a few years Mr. and Mrs. Packard made their home in Portland, Me. In 1874 they removed to Spring- field, Mass. They became the parents of three sons: Walter Alvin, born December 17, 1877; Arthur Howard, born November 17, 1879; and Raymond Clark, born July 11, 1881. Mr. Packard died in Springfield, at the age of fifty- eight years, May 1, 1893, from disease contracted in the service thirty years before.
