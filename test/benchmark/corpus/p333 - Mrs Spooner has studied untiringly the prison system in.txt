Mrs. Spooner has studied untiringly the prison system in America. Her huuiane and

practical rtniuests lunc .seldom been denied. She has succeeded in getting notable people together at important houses and in the-chapels of leading churches. Bishops, governors, and other officials have so recognizeil her great earnestness, sincerity, anil simplicity that they have been moved to say the right word at the right time: and for this reason she insists that the credit for the successful agitation and awakening of the public conscience to the evils existing in the prisons belongs to the wise men of a marvellous century.

In 1894 Governor Greenhalge gave his sup- port to her cau.se by presiding at a meeting wlieic three subjects were especially advocated — al)olition of dungeons (dark cells), the in- determinate sentence, and the supplanting of hou,ses ol correction by reformatories. Prison conuni.ssioners and representatives of the l-'rison Association and other organizations participated in the discussion. This meeting, the first held by the Prison I^etorm League, was arranged by Mrs. Spooner, .Mrs. .James T. Fields, and Miss Mason. Among other conferences held by Mrs. Spooner and her co-workers was one at Trinity Church Chapel, presided over by Mayor Quincy.

The successful work accomplished by Mrs. Spooner toward the abolishment of dark cells in the city prisons and the gootl done by her was specially commended by Dr. Alfred B. Heath, Conunissioner, Institutions Department of the City of Boston, in 1896. Penal Com- missioner Ernest .C. Marshall has also officially endorsed her beneficent work. The League has agitated the subject of tlie present system of fines for drunkenness, which they consider as indefensible. Tlie Police Conunission re- sponded pn-mptly to their request for co-oper- ation, and Chairman Martin invited Mrs. Spooner, Mr. Piobert Treat Paine, Conunissioner Marshall, and a Sister of St. Margaret's to make a midnight toiu' of inspection of station-house cells as a stii&lt;ly of the subject.

In 1896-97, under the guidance of leading men, wise and con.servative, she engaged in the movement to aliolisli capital punishment, resulting in the substitution of the electric chair for the scaffold. She oi-ganized the Anti-Death Penalty League in 1897, and, after the first

twenty signatures were obtained, names were forwarded her in such numbers that it was impossible for one person to keep the records. Mrs. Spooner wrote numerous letters to experts throughout the country, and secured valuable facts that resulted in the formation of this League. The following triljute to her work is co]ji(Ml from an editorial in a Boston paper: —

"The brave attacks that have been made by a Massachusetts woman against prison evils interfering with physical, moral, and mental improvement, have not merely been approved in this country, but they have attracted at- tention on the other side of the ocean. Now, through her efforts, a tour of investigation is being made through the South to in([uire into prison systems and the measures that are used to reform criminals of both sexes. The camp life, for instance, with its vicious environments, offers little chance for t)etter living or enil)rac- ing any religious instruction. The men in chain gangs who are hired out for work and exposed to the public gaze and cruel criticism do not, as a rule, know the meaning of the word ' en- couragement.' Their existence is often a hell on earth, and the wonder is, they survive its degradation as long as they do. The hope of improving and elevating inmates of prisons may be fallacious, sentimental: but, unless im- provement is achieved l^y some such endeavor, humanity hapjiier in its surroundings must be the sufferer. It is to vigilant reform that North, South, East, and West now look for inspiration for the ways and means that will elevate character, even when paying its penalty for crime.''
