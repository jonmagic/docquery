Never was mother more devoted, more self- sacrificing than she. Had she been less noble, less brave, less tender of her child, she would have remained at home to enjoy her mother- hood at the expense of other mothers. She once exclaimed, "The most precious legacy I can leave my child is a free country!"

It was about this time that the woman's rights cause came up as an independent reform. Mrs. Foster had fought the battle for the right of women to speak in public, and had gained it for herself and for all women. Now came the broader cpiestion of the right to vote, which involves all other rights. She was ear-

nest in its advocacy, and came to see th;it it was a much more comprehensive reform than even the anti-slavery movement. But she felt that her life was consecrated to the slave, and that her failing voice and broken health nuist be husbanded for that service. Yet she was thoroughly identified with the suffrage movement, and was recognized, with the Grimkes, as the pioneer who, with bleeding feet, smoothed the path through which the women of the suffrage movement might lead their sex to the light.

Mrs. Foster's last jniblic work was devoted to raising money for rousing public sentiment to the necessity of carrying the Fifteenth Amendment. With the other loyal friends of the freedmen, she felt that freedom without the ballot was an empty name. She could no longer speak from the platform, but her earnest pleading in private rarely failed to convince her listener that justice was the only safe course for the nation to pursue. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars were contributed through her to be spent in holding meetings throughout the North and in publishing and distributing documents for the enlightenment of the public. This amendment at last carried, she felt that she had at last earned a discharge from the army of workers.

Those who listened to Abby Kelley in the days of her young womanhood have told me of her wonderful power. This consisted, I imag- ine, in her intense earnestness, in her utter self-forgetfulness and consecration. Her lan- guage was of Quaker simplicity, unadorned with figures or imagery. She never wrote her speeches, and rarely spent any time in their l)reparation ; but the eloquence of a heart on fire, words lighted at the altar of Cod's truth, were hers. Her audience felt that she " re- membered those in bonds as bountl with them." Such a passion for freedom, such unselfish devotion, could not fail to inspire admiration and win converts.

Though Miss Kelley's featiires were not beau- tiful, she had an attractive personality. Her lithe, graceful figure was crowned with a head of fine outlines, well poised on a beautiful neck, and covered with abundant dark brown hair, hardly gray, even at her death. The Quaker

kerchief, laid in folds around her neck, was tlie one article of personal adornment to which she clung. Its simplicity was perhaps its special charm, so completely did it harmonize with the purity and sincerity of the wearer.
