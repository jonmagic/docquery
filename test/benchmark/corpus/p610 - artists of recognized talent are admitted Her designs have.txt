ANNIE C. SHATTUCK, of Fitchburg, /\ Mass., a National .\ide in the Woman's X. ^ Relief Corps and a devoted worker for the cause of patriotism, was born No- vember 26, 1851, at New Ipswich, N.H., her j)arents being \\'illiain K. and Elizabeth (Stark) Hassall. On the paternal side she comes of a long line of worthy New England ancestors, one of whom, Anna Hassall, was massacred by the Indians, September 2, 1691. On her mother's side she is a descendant of Arcliii)ald Stark, born in Glasgow, Scotland, in ]&amp;)7, who married Eleanor Nichols iji Londonderry, Ireland, and came to New England in 1720 with the party of Scotch-Irish that settled Londontierry, N.H. From this pair Mrs. Shat- tuck claims descent through Major-general John Stark (as a great-great-grand-daughter) tlie noted Revolutionary hero, who at Bennington and on other battle-fields achieved so much for the cause of American independence.

Annie C. Hassall was edvicated in the public schools and at the then noted Appleton Acad- emy in her native town. In 1861, on the break- ing out of the Civil War, when societies were being formed for the relief of the soldiers at the front and in the hospitals, her mother, who was an active member of some of these .societies, wishing her to aid in the good work, taught her how to knit. Although then but a girl of ten, she knit several pairs of hose, which, with

comfort bags that she helped to make and fill and other supplies, were sent to the brave "boys in blue." Among her most treasured keepsakes now are some letters that she re- ceived from one of these soldiers, who was wounded and very ill in the hospital, and who on receiving one of these comfort bags wrote to express his gratitude and appreciation of the work done by those at home for the sol- diers.

In 1871 Miss Hassall became the wife of Frederick D. Shattuck, who had enlisted in the Union army soon after the attack on Fort Sumter, and served subsequently until the close of the war. He is now a member of E. V. Sum- ner Post, No. 19, G. A. R., of Fitchburg.

Mr. and Mrs. Shattuck are the parents of three children, two daughters and a son. The son, Frederick A. Shattuck, was for two years and a half a teacher in the service of the United States government in the Philippines, where he instructed the children in the principles of liberty and representative government, and taught them to love the flag of the country whence they had received these blessings. From the islands he forwarded to his home in Fitchburg some valuable and interesting souve- nirs, accompanietl by letters containing 9. record of his experiences, with interesting descriptions of the country and its people, showing him to be a young man of observation and keen in- sight as well as literary ability. He is now teaching in Tokio, Japan, where he is associated with the Rev. Dr. Gate, a Universalist mis- sionary.
