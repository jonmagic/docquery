wood Institute, Pittsfield, Mass. She is a mem- ber of the Maplewood Akimiia&gt; Association, and at its first reunion she contributed an origi- nal poem, which appealed with especial interest to the members of her class wlio were present.

Mrs. Williams has musical ability of no mean order. She played in public before she was out of her teens, and taught instrumental music for several years with excellent success.

When cooking-schools were first opened for instruction, she wrote on culinary education and the philoso])hy of good living, from the Boston and New York cooking-schools, for Southern, Western, and Eastern papers, often receiving in reference to them complimentary and a])preciative letters from utter strangers.

Mrs. Williams was a newspaper correspondent at Mount Desert Island, Maine, for twelve sum- mers, and was acknowletlged as an active force in bringing into notice a section of that country which is now widely known. Her correspond- ence from Saratoga, at one time the queen of Spas, was considered worthy of being j^laced on file. It may well be said that, wherever Mrs. Williams set the impress of her facile, graceful pen, it exhibited that subtle ciuality recognized as "style."

At one time Mrs. Williams was a |)aid con- tributor to eleven newspapers. She has been a contributor since 1881 to the Boston Tran- script. She has also contributed to the Youth' !^ Companion, Arti^ for America, the Houaehold, and other publications. A series of lectures on literary, historical, and art topics she has presented in many States with gratifying suc- cess. In her ceramic art lectures, which are fully illustrated by specimens, she was a pioneer, and, having visited the leading potteries and art museums in this country in pursuing this fascinating branch of study, she is an acknowl- edged authority on the subject.

Mrs. Williams has treated with consummate skill the mystery of Mary Stuart. Her strong rendering of the Queen's plea, on trial for her life before the P'nglish bar, often shakes the belief of those who have always thought the Queen was guilty. More than that cannot be done for a great historic doubt. Mrs. Will- iams's essay on the subject of Mary Stuart is pronounced by Mrs. Livermore to be a "gem

of literary condensation." A professional and prolific writer thus expresses his appreciation: " Mrs. Williams is one of the most alive anti immediate students, not only in the Stuart chronicles, the great masters of art, the litera- ture of the. early civilizations, but in the lore of the Queen who 'launched a thousand ships, and burned the topless towers of Ilium,' — Helen of Troy."

Mrs. Williams has given some of her choice entertainments liefore several notable charities: the Jackson Park Sanitarium for sick babies and the Model Lodging House in Chicago, through the auspices of the famous Archie (Arkay) Club of that city; the Bethel Social Settlement, Aged Couples' Home, and the Saint Barnabas Cuild of Nurses, Minneapolis; the Berkshire County Home for Aged Women, Pittsfield, Mass. ; and the Educational and In- dustrial l^nion, Buffalo, N.Y.
