accuracy of aim gained from a youthful fond- ness for archery, hit him scjuarcly in the chest, arousing him instantly. After a bewildered moment he sjirang to his feet, then, catching sight of his deliverer, who was waving to him from the dei)arting train, he bowed his heart- felt thanks, orange in hand.

The first |)ublic work of Mrs. Dyer was on the Board of Management of the Dedham Home for Discharged Female Prisoners, to which she was appointed in 1864. For twenty- eight years she never failed, except during serious illness, to pay her monthly visit, ^\'llen the Ladies' Aid Society was formed to aid the Soldiers' Home, Mrs. Dyer was made its sec- retary, and the next year, 1882, its pre.'^ident, a position that she held for ten years. The military strain in Mrs. Dyer's blooil fitteil her peculiarly for this office. Under her gui&lt;lance the numbers rapidly increaseil, and thousands of dollars were raised to give comforts to the home. The society has furnished rooms, pro- vided a library and all sorts of smaller luxuries. A fine portrait of the "right bowei' of the Sol- diers' Home" (as the trustees call Mrs. Dyer) hangs in the chapel of the home, and one of the rooms is set apart and named for her.

Her rare executive ability combined with an even temperament makes her a natural leader of large bodies. During her presidency of the Ladies' Aitl she comlucted several fairs, which netted handsome sums. The Ladies' Aid table at tlie Soldiers' Carnival under her direction cleareil nearly six thoasaml dollars. Later a kettledrum for the .same benefit netted four thousand dollars, anil another fair for the Soldiers' Home netted ten thousand dollars. For this fair some one facetiously offered, when told they could give anything tliey chose, a live pig. Mrs. Dyer, readily .seeing a novel feature for her fair, accepted the offer. Piggy was comfortably ensconced in an improvi.sed ]X'n, presiding over a box inscribed with bright ver.ses from this lady's fertile brain, inviting contributions for his maintenance. Tliirty tlollars was realized from this exhibit. Then the pig was .sent to tiie Soitfifrs' Home, where in the cour.se of time he was served.

The Boston Educational and Industrial Union in 1885 asked Mrs. Dyer to take charge

of an entertainment for its benefit, and she arranged a Dickens Carnival, which brought in seven thousand tlollars. In 1S8S Mrs. Dyer was at the heati of the Board of Managers of the great fair held in Music Hall by which the sum of thirteen thousand dollars was raised in a single week for the benefit of The Home for Intemperate Women.

The Charity Club of Boston, which ha"s become so well known, was the outgrowth of this fair. The committee of fifty women who had worked so successfully and harmoni- ously under Mrs. Dyer's guidance banded themselyes together to raise money for any good object. Mrs. Dyer conceived the idea of starting a free hospital for respectable women witliout means in need of important surgical operations. A house at 3&lt;S Chester Park was bought, and a hospital started when the Club had not a cent in its treasury. How the owner was induced to take a mortgage for a sum less than he had asked for the projjerty, leaving the Club an equity for nothing, how man}' ingenious devices were resorted to to furnish, to pay interest, taxes, and running expenses, only the Club members know; but the good work went on and prosperetl. The president, whose faith was so great, buoyed up the others.
