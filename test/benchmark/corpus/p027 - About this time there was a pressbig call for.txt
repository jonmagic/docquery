"About this time there was a pressbig call for funds from the anti-slavery societies, anrl I sold some of tlie most expensive articles of my wardrobe, and forwarded the proceeds to the treasury, feeling that I could not withhold even a feather's weight of help that might hasten the downfall of the terrible system which, by crushing and cursing the slave, had de- prived the whole country of the liberty of speech and the press, and the right of peaceable assemblage and petition."

(It should be said at this point that Miss Kelley had alreadj' given to the society all her accumulated earnings and the small inheri- tance recently received from her father's estate.) " Not long after tliJs, in one of our Scripture read- ings at breakfast, I read from a chapter con- taining these words: 'Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath chosen the fftolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, . . . and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.' I closed the book and said to my mother: 'My way is clear now: a new light has broken on me. How true it is, as history records, that all great reforms have been carried forward by weak and despised means! The talent, the learning, the wealth, the Church, and the State, are pledged to the support of slavery. I will go

out among the honest-hearted common people, into the highways and byways, and cry, "Pity the poor slave!" if I can do nothing more.' My mother still hoped that I might be spared from taking up so heavy a cross;. but I told her I had counted the cost, and though, as an abo- litionist, I must take my life in my hand, and, as a public-speaking woman, must .suffer more than the loss of life, yet all I could give, and all I was, was but as dust in the balance, if my efforts could gain over to our cause a few honest souls.

"I had a sister living in Connecticut, who was quite in accord with me, and at her house I now made my home, going out as oppor- tunities were offered me by the few abolitionists of that vicinity. I was entirely unknown and uidicard of, except as some New York paper, in its denunciation and ridicule of the anti- slavery meetings, might refer to me as 'that monstrosity, a public-speaking woman.' I had no endorsement from any society, none but a few of my most intimate friends knowing of my purpose. The reason for my going out thus was my doubt of being able to serve the great cause in this way; and I did not wish to involve any other person in the trials, perils, and tribulations to which I should be liable."
