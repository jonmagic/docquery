year, as first agreed, they remained in the school for four years. As a result of the article in the Transcript there were many visitors to the kindergarten each day, both residents of Bos- ton and strangers. A gentleman from Chicago, an educator, after a visit to the school, pro- nounced it education in its highest sense, and said that he would like to take some of the material as a means of rendering instruction to his young ladies in .some of the higher branches.

And thus the interest grew, and the class increased in numbers, until a larger room was taken in their house. Here a Mothers' Class was started; and, as Miss Rust considered her- self too much of a novice to assume the respon- sibility of this class, at her request Miss Pea- body took the charge. She was a great in- spiration to the work, and this Mothers' Class and also this home was blessed by her presence, as she often remained after the hour of the class, and thus the family pas.sed many happy hours with her socially.

One of the patrons of this school now removed to Brookline, and, desiring her children to remain under Miss Rust's instruction, made arrangements for an afternoon kintlergarten to be established in her home, the location of which was unusually adapted to such a pur- pose, the house, with pine woods near, being surrounded by nature in all its beauty. This kindergarten was carried on until the city classes had gro^\^l to such a size that they re- quired Mi.ss Rust's full attention, time, and strength. Not long after this the health of Mrs. Rust failed, her strength not being equal to hav- ing the school (which with its advanced classes it had now become) in the house; therefore it was removed from the home. These advanced classes were beyond the kindergarten age, but none were allowed to enter them who had not had previous preparation either in this kinder- garten or in another, equally genuine, thus making the school a strong, connected whole, without disturbance or confusion for the pupils' minds, one class, as it were, evolving from an- other. Children were received from three or four years of age, as the child's health allowed, until the age of twelve. All the instruction was given upon Froebelian principles. Usu-

ally chiUlren at six years were startetl in the so-called primary work, which, with their pre- vious jjreparation, was easily grasped, the chil- tlren being just as eager about their arithmetic, for example, as they had been about the attrac- tive kindergarten gifts and occupations. The originality of each child had been preserved, and now was most beautifully manifested along the Hues of art, music, games, and so forth. Music was taught on kindergarten principles, and in this way it is a possession to the pupil not easily forgotten. Pupils returning to the school in the fall went right on with their music as if there had been no vacation. The folding oc- cupation, previously taught, prepared the flex- ible little hand for music, making the fingers deft and securing the right position of the hand, thus saving two or more terms of instruction. In fact, the analytical and synthetical method of the child's previous instruction made all its after work and study a pleasure, and proved that it was fully grasped, being its own posses- sion.
