petus to the study of art. Mrs. Prang visited him in Boston, and, introducing his l)ooks in Syracuse, found them of great service in mak- ing possible the study of historic ornament, supplying in some measure the examples neces- sary for her work.

Mrs. Prang's remarkable physique and ex- cellent health enabled her to complete success- fully an unusual amount of labor. Several of her classes in the high scliool numbered seventy or eighty pupils each, but Mrs. Prang worked with the strength of her convictions, and with a joyousness of spirit that communi- cated itself to her pupils.

In order that the children might be properly taught, she formed teachers' classes that were conducted after school hours. In atUlition she closely supervised the work in all the schools, and was ever ready to help the teachers with pertinent suggestions and cheerful en- couragement. Her supervision of the schools of Syracuse extendeil over more than ten years: and there are teachers in the field to-day, occupying high positions, who are proud to trace the beginning of their successes to the influence of Mrs. Prang, with whom they were associated as high school students or as grade teachers.

Exhibitions of public school drawings were held at the high school building, anil, while children and teachers were thus encouraged and stimulated, the general public became educated as to the possibilities of children in this direction. The.se exhibitions, together with exhibitions made at the State Teachers' Association and at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, were all factors in the progress of art education in the public schools.

In Syracuse they attracted the attention of broud-mimled people, and comprehensive re- ports upon them were made by physicians, ar- chitects, and other jieopie of education, among whom were Dr. Martin B. Anderson, President of Rochester University, and Dr. Andrew D. AVhite, President of Cornell University. The public schools of Syracuse became well known as foremost in the country in art education.

Entleavoring in every way to spread the influence of art, Mrs. Prang assisteil largel}' in the development of the Social Art Club of

Syracuse, the purpose of which was the read- ing of the history of art and the study of his- toric antl current art. Mrs. Prang was president of the club for five j'ears, and through her ef- forts its members were able to gather illus- trations and to pursue a systematic course of reading relating to ancient, early Christian, and modern art. The club was extremely popular, the wailhig list being filled with names of women of the highest social standing. The present president, formerly a student with Mrs. Prang, has held the position for twenty- five years. The Social Art Club was the second club formed in Syracuse, being antedated only by the Portfolio Club, an association of Mrs. Prang's pupils.
