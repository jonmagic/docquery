For about ten years (1840-50) she kept at the family home, 13 West Street, Boston, a shop for the sale of foreign books and journals, and a circulating library, the place becoming for the time a "centre of the finest intellectual culture." Here were held some of Margaret Fuller's conversations.

Miss Peabody was a contributor to the Chris- tian Examiner, the Dial, Barnard's Journal nj Education, and otlier periocHcals. Among her books were (not to make an exhau?;tive Hst of the works of her pen): "Moral Self-echication," translated from the French, 1S28; "First Steps in History"; "Key to Hebrew History"; also "Keys to Grecian and to Roman History," 1833; "Record of a School" (Mr. Alcott's), 1835 (third edition, revised, 1874); with Mrs. Mann, "Moral Culture of Infancy" and "Kin- dergarten Guide," of which after her visit to Europe she issued early in the seventies a re- vised edition; "Reminiscences of William E. Channuig, D.D."; and "A Last Evening with Allston."

Mrs. Mann, besides being a writer on educa- tional topics and a translator, was the author of "A Physiological Cook-book," "Flower Peo- ple," "Life of Horace Mann," and "Juanita, a Romance of Real Life in Cuba."

Toward the close of her life Elizabeth Pea- body became blind. She died in Jamaica Plain, January 3, 1894, in her ninetieth year.

On May 2, 1904, two weeks before the one hundredth anniversary of her birth, at a meet- ing of the New England \A'omen's Club, of which she had been a valuetl member, heart- felt tribute in the form of letters and addresses of some length was paid to her memory by Mrs. Howe, president of the club, Mrs. Cheney, Colonel Higginson, Dr. Hale, and others who had known her long and well.

Mrs. Howe, after speaking of her as one who "recognized everywhere the beauty and glory of existence," said: "I cannot remember evei' to have known any one who carried throi\gh life so much of this serene atmosphere, the re- sult of high aspirations, genuine culture, and sweet humanity. Her nature was very ex- pansive and her life full of benevolcMit activity. . . . She helped Margaret Fuller to arrange her first conversations in Boston. Slie espoused the cause of the Pole, the Hungarian, the Ind- ian. She was the devoted frientl of Kossuth's sister. Whom has she not befriended when they most needed a friend? Her declining years were followed with love and gratitude."

Mrs. Cheney alluded to the fact that in her old age [*;iizabeth Palmer Pealxxly was often

spoken of as "the grandmother of Boston," and added: "She was rightly named if the con- stant outflow of her warm heart to every one with all manner of loving feelings and helpful deeds and the best of all instructions to the children of every age in the city of her love could entitle her to this distinction. . . . Her large and varied reading filled her mind with stores of history, poetry, and philosophy. She gathered special advantage from the hobbies into which she entered with all her heart for the time. Out of them she gained always something rich and rare.
