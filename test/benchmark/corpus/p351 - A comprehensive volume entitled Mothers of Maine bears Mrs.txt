A comprehensive volume, entitled "Mothers of Maine," bears Mrs. Beedy's name upon the title-page. The compilation of facts was a long but delightful task to her, and so well did she succeed in her work that this history of remarkable Maine women covers a period of more than two centuries.

Thus author, educator, lecturer, phihinthro- pist, may all be written after Mrs. I^eedy's

name. And t(j such as know her there will come to mind unwritten achievements of daily life which stand for true courage and integrity.

Note. — As this article was about to go to press, we received the news of Mrs. Beedy's death, which oc- curred June 14, 1904.

MARY (T.ARA WARE KIRBY.— The \\'are family, to which Mrs. Kirby ijelongs, has been represented in Massachusetts nearly two hundred and fifty years. Its founder in this coun- try Was Robert \\'are, who came from Devon, England, in 1664. He was given a grant of land in Dedham, and two years later was made "freeman." A man of imi)t)rtance in the connnunity, the second largest tax-payer in the town, and a member of the artillery com- pany, he was a good neighbor, a kind husband and father. He died in 1698. His will, drawn tlie year previous, shows more than usual jus- tice and thoughtfulness toward the wife he was leaving to the care of his children. The breadth of vision and mental strength of this their first American ancestor .seem to have been transmitted in large degree to his ilescendants. In 1775 Joseph ^^'are, a great-grandson of the innnigrant, was one of the soldiers hi Ar- nokl's famous expedition against Quebec, and won promotion for his bravery. His Journal of the Expedition (published in 1884 by Joseph Ware, of Needham, a great-grandson) is historically valuable, containing among other data a complete list of the Americans killed, wounded, and taken prisoners on the fateful day of December 31, 1775.

l^nitarian for generations in their religious preferences, the Wares have numbered in their ranks many distinguished clergymen and scholars. Ralph A\'are, a great-grandson of the Revolutionary hero and the father of the subject of this .sketch, was of the liberal school of thought, and when he married Mary Jordan, the daughter of an English rniversalist clergy- man, it is small woiuler that in their home all matters of advanced thought and scientific research should have been given im]nirtial con- sideration.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

There were nine chiklren, seven living to attain their majority, yet the mother could always find time to help a neighbor or friend in illness or distress, and her house was at all times a place of refuge for the troubled and weary. She finished her work here, as her well-rounded life, patterned after that of Him who "went about doing good," came to an earthly close late in the year of 1893; but its influence can never be calculated, nor will it ever cease to be.

Of such parentage was born Mary Clara Ware in Dorchester, Mass. As the eldest of four sisters, she was always ready to give assistance to the younger, and at school the unfortunate found in her a friend quick to sympathize, with a judgment far beyond her years. The timid little ones sought lier hand for protection, the slow ones brought the prob- lems they could not solve, and the friend- less looked toward her, sure of a smile. So even and true was she, and still is, that some one who has known Mrs. Kirby all her life said recently: "Oh, well! It is no effort for her to be afTable and kind. She never seemed to want to be any other way." But, since no life is free from its trials, and as every heart knoweth its own bitterness, some credit is surely due this woman who never seemed to want to be anything but agreeable.
