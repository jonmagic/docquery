As shown by family records and remem- brances, supplementing the genealogy in the i?.s.sex Antiquarian, vol. ii., Mrs. Sutherland's maternal grandmother, Pamela Adams Green- leaf, was a daughter of Nathan Adams and his wife, Johanna Batchelder, and a descendant in

the sixth generation of Robert Adams and his wife Eleanor, early .settlers of Newbury, Mass. From Robert' the line continued through his son Abraham,-' who married Mary Pettingell; Abraham,' and his wife Anne, daughter of William and Anne (Sewall) Longfellow and niece of Judge Sewall; and Henry^ and his first wife, Sarah Emery, who were the parents of Nathan^ Adams, of Newbury, Mass., and Wis- casset, Me.

James Baker, of Boston, was a devoted anti- slavery worker and a warm personal friend of Theodore Parker. He died when his daughter I'^velyn was only three years of age. Her edu- cation was carefully looked after by her mother, her earliest training being received in the pub- lic schools. She was later placed in the quaint little "dame" school of Miss Rebecca Lincohi on Pinckney Street, where the old house is still standing. She next attended Miss Caroline Johnson's celebrated school on Ashburton Place, completing her education by two years' study in Geneva, Switzerland. She showed literary tastes when but a child, by writing little rhymes and tales; and at the age of fifteen she was awarded a prize for an essay on "What is a Gentleman?" by Our Young Folka, now known as Si. Nicholas. Since then her writings, ver.se or pro.se, have been much before the pub- lic, appearing in Puck, Life, the Cotiniopolitan, and other magazines. In 1894, under the name of Dorothy Lundt, a nam de plume which she used for twenty years, she won one of the prizes offered by McClure'f^ Magazine by an army tale, "Diccon's Dog." Through this little product of her pen has come a happy ex- perience. A noted novelist, at a reception shortly after the publication of the story, spoke of it in highest praise, not knowing that she was addressing the author herself. A con- fession followed, and the friendship thus begun between the two women has been lasting.

For many years Mrs. Sutherland was a writer on the staff of the Boston Transcript, from the autunm of 1887 contributing to its colunuis both book reviews and draniartic criticisms. Her success in the latter line is well known. She heartily attributes all cretlit for what she has acconiplishetl in dramatic criticism to her training under Mr. Francis Jenks, for many

years the dramatic editor of the Transcript. In her first assignment under Mr. Jenks he gave her a lesson which served as a basis for all her future work in that line. He asked, "Do you know what the word critic means?" Somewhat confused, she answered, "Perhaps not in the sense you mean." "Go to the dic- tionary and find out," he said. She found the original Greek word meant one who discerns. Mr. Jenks said, tersely, "Always bear that in mind, and don't confuse the discerner with the fault-finder." Under his teaching her abili- ties developetl, and in 1889 and 1890, while Mr. William Apthorp was in Europe, she wrote most of the first-night criticisms for the Tran- script. During her connection with the Tran- script she conducted a very interesting column called "Library and Foyer," signed "Dorothy Lundt." It was original and cle.ver, and was much appreciated by Transcript readers. Her work on this paper continued uninterruptedly for seven years, when, in 1894, she suffered from acute nervous prostration, and for eleven months lived out of the city and retired from active life. Upon her return she was greatly shocked to learn of the recent sudden death of her beloved "Father in Journalism," Mr. Jenks.
