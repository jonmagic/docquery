Through the untiring efforts of Mrs. Alexander M. Ferris, of Newton, with the assistance of the State regent and chapters,' Massachusetts sent a large contribution for the monument at Valley Forge, which was dedicated in October, 1901, by the General Society, Daughters of the Revolution. The General Society has its headquarters at 156 Fifth Avenue, New York City; the State So- ciety, at the Colonial Building, Boylston Street, Boston.

The special work of the society during the past year, undertaken at the suggestion of Mrs. Adeline F.

The plan was ' successfully carried out, and on May 3, 1904, while the General Society, by invitation of the State Society, was hold- ing its annual meeting in Boston, a bronze tablet, the work of the artist, C. W. Harley, placed in the music room of the library, was imveiled in the presence of an appreciative audience.
