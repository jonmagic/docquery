This grewsome tale was told to Mrs. Drake's grandmother McKinney by a Mrs. Parks, who heard the confession.

One of Mrs. Drake's sisters, Mrs. Jeanne Ogden Miller, of Salt Lake City, bears a strik- ing resemblance in the general outline of her features to Vanderlyn's portrait, a profile view, of Theodosia Burr, as reproduced in James Barton's "Life of Aaron Burr."

A comparison of the photograph of another sister, Mrs. Katherine McKinney Herbert, with the photograph of a painted portrait, supposed to be that of Theodosia Burr, reveals a marked likeness between the two. Of this more below.

It was from an article in a Chicago news- paper that Mrs. Drake, while living at her father's home in Sturgis, Mich., first heard of the existence in Elizabeth City, N.C., of a

portrait which was thought to represent the daughter of Aaron Burr. It was owned by a Dr. Pool. In the sunmier of 1888 Mrs. Drake, then staying with her parents at Virginia Beach, N.C., visited the home of the Pool family, only a few miles distant. On the parlor wall, over the mantle-piece, hung the portrait of a young woman of great beauty, dressed in white. She knew it at once as the picture she had come to see, and she felt confirmed in her belief that it was a portrait of Theo- dosia Burr because it resembled her sister, Katherine McKinney Heibert. Miss Pool (now Mrs. Overman), daughter of the deceased doctor, told her how it came into her father's possession, as the gift of a patient, a Mrs. Mann, to whom it had lieen given by a sailor lover many years l)efore. The portrait and two silk dresses that accompanied it as presents had been taken from an abandoned pilot boat off Cape Hat- teras, these articles being found in the cabin. The sailors who boarded the boat found, or professed to have found, nothing to identify either the vessel or the owner of the dresses and the f)riginal of the portrait. After the picture came into the possession of Dr. Pool and its story became' known, it was surmised that the jiilot boat was the missing "Patriot," and the dresses a part of the wardrobe of Theo- dosia BiuT Alston, of whom the picture is considered by Mrs. Drake to be an undoubted likeness.

Mrs. Drake's story of the picture will be retold by Mr. Pidgin in his forthcoming book, whose object is to throw light on the mystery that enshrouds the fate of the beautiful and accomplished Theodosia Burr.
