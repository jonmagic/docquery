Mr. and Mrs. Alexander migrating to Iowa a few years after the birth of their daughter Ada, she was educated in the public schools of that State. At the age of seventeen she began teaching school. This vocation she followed successfully until her marriage to Clinton F^dwin Achorn, which took place at Cherokee, Iowa, January 10, 1882. Mr. and Mrs. Achorn have one son, Kendall Lincoln Achorn, born October 20, 1882. He is now a Senior in the Lawrence scientific department of Harvard LTniversity.

For several years Mrs. Achorn was enthu- siastically engaged iii temperance work among young people, she lieing in the Independent Order of Gootl Templars, to her the best of all organizations for its purpose, which she many times worthily represented in district and State sessions, and in which she still holds member- ship. SJie did her first temi)erance work as a member of the Woman's Christian Tem- perance LTnion, and she belonged to that so- ciety until her entire time was needed for her practice. She is a member of the Woman's Relief Corps, E. 0. C. Ord Corps, No. 105, Department of Iowa, which she repeatedly

served in the capacity of treasurer, secretary, and president. She also belongs to the Daugh- teis of the American Revolution, Dorothy Dix Chapter, Waltham, Mass., deriving her title to membership through her descent from Joseph Alexander, her father's paternal grand- father, who enlisted at Simsbury, Pa., and .served under General Putnam in the Revolu- tionary War.

In June, 1897, when the Boston Institute of Osteopathy was organizerl, she became the .secretary ami treasurer anil one of its instructors, and she has been actively identified with that institution to the present time.
