" I count it first of all chiefest of felicities

To have a spirit poised, and calm, and whole, And next in order of felicities

I hold it to have walked with such a soul."

Miss Eastman's education in earlier girl- hood was received mainly in the public schools of Lowell, whose limitations were supplemented at the same time by instruction in j:)rivate classes in drawing, painting, horseback riding, dancing, and later in the Lewis gymnastics. The public course ended with the excellent high school.

So far as careful investigation by Miss East- man could go some years since, she concluded that to Lowell belongs the honor of being the first city in the whole country to open a high school for girls as well as boys. General Benjamin F. Butler was of the first class, and well remembered Miss Eastman as his one girl classmate, of whom he kept track for some time.

It was with poignant grief to the family of Miss Eastman, as well as to herself, that, when the high school course of instruction ended,

Harvard and other colleges tiiat welcomed the boy graduates barred their doors against girls. Therefore the unfortunate girl was compelled to accept the resources of a seminary for young ladies.

An eager desire for the most fundamental mental training obtainable by girls led her, on the advice of a favorite teacher, to enter a State Normal School at West Newton. There she fount! what she sought as to quality of instruction. This pledged her to the work of teaching, which was altogether congenial to her. Directly after graduating, she was invited to take charge of the high school at South Brook- field, Mass. After two years she accepted a position in the Boston High and Normal School, where she remained several years.

When Arttioch College in Ohio opened, under the leadership of the great educator and states- man, Horace Mann, he urged Miss Eastman and a classmate at the normal school to enter as pupils. Notwithstanding their high esteem for Horace Mann, the parents of Miss Eastman felt that Ohio was too far away. After she had become a teacher. President Mann invited her to come as instructor in the preparatory classes of the college, and she went to a most interesting work, with mature pupils, most of them by many years her seniors. She had a class of very interesting and loyal students. Here she remained till near the close of Horace Mann's noble life.

Antioch, like Oberlin, which preceded it, opened its doors, without restriction of race or sex, something hitherto unprecedented in history. But while Oberlin gave to women a motlified course, presuming, it seems, on only limited capacity in the female brain, or limited need that the sex should be much educatetl, Antioch, grown bolder and wiser, and with Horace Mann at its head, offered the same cur- riculum to all.

Says President George L. Gary, professor at Antioch and later President of the Meadville Theological School, "In the light of the expe- rience of the last forty years it need harilly be said that the women who responded to this welcome needed to have no concession made to their imagined inferiority."
