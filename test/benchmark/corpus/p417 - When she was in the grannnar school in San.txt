When she was in the grannnar school in San Francisco, she was chosen by the manager of the Bush Street Theatre as one of more than a score of childien to take part in a living chess spectacle, antl began her stage career as Queen's Knight in "A Royal Middy." For the next three seasons she sang in light opera in tlie same theatre. At the age of sixteen she began a two years' engagement with a stock company in Oakland, Cal., and when twenty years of age she joined a small dramatic com- pany which toured California. She next made her appearance with the Cordray Stock Com- pany in engagements which took her ovitside the State, presenting each week a different play. Here it was that she acquired her remarkable facility for acting one part while studying an- other. Here, too, she realized to the full how different from the stage-struck girl's idea are the realitie^s of stage life, with its endless rou-

Fol- lowing these experiences she appeared with Miss Minnie Seligman at the Madison Square Theatre, with Miss Katherine Clemmons at the Fifth Avenue, and with Miss Carrie Turner in "The Crust of Society."

The next two years she played in W^ash- ington, D.C., returning in 1903 to the Castle Si|uare Theatre.
