Soon after her return to Farmington and be- fore taking her much needed rest, she sought two friends and proposed the formation of a

REPRESENTATRE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

women's club. This was in the very early days of clubs for women: in all New England there were only a few. The new club entered at once upon its work, and continued for many years one of the oldest women's clubs in Maine. In its origin it was true to the German proverb, "All good things go in tlirees": it had but three members. That tliere might be no favoritism, each member was to bear the Piclcwickian title P. P. Miss Hoyt was made Perpetual Presi- dent, and the two remaining members were made Perpetual Poet and Perpetual Penman. There was no treasurer, as there were no club dues. As the membership was at first exclu- sive, one who was not invited to join remarked that she thought the ladies were rather "hifa- lutin." The term so pleased the members of the club that they concluded to adopt it; anrl the Hifalutin Club, with an increase of member- ship, continued until Maine agitated the fed- eration of its women's clubs, when the Every Monday Club of Farmington was organized, and the Hifalutin fell asleep. It was the orig- inal idea of the club to read at home and dis- cuss the matter read in the club. It was in every sense a working club; every play and many of the sonnets of Shakespeare were studied, also Spenser's "Faerie Queene," Chau- cer's Canterbury Tales, Milton, Dante, and other classic writers. With a retentive mem- ory and viviti imagination. Miss Hoyt delighted to review for the benefit of the club the lead- ing fiction of that day. The writer recalls "Uarda" and "The Egyptian Princess" and many other books thus graphically portrayed. Miss Hoyt believed in keeping abreast of the times, and was a wise reader of the daily news- papers. The consideration of current events formed an important feature in the Hifalutin Club.

On May 18, 1901, there came a hush over the village of Farmington, when it was an- nounced that Jane W. Hoyt was dead. For twenty-five years she had lived her useful, un- ostentatious life in that community, loved and respected by all classes of society. As a private tutor she had given direction to the college life of many young men and women by imparting to them an enthusia.sm for work. They lin- gered long over their recitations, that between

the lines they might catch glimpses of the spirit that actuated her. Few of her pupils will fail to remember the talks on practical ethics and moral philosophy which she loved to interweave with the higher mathematics, Latin, French, and German. In addition to her labors as a teacher Miss Hoyt carrietl on other literary work. She wrote for the press, and was much sought after as a lecturer before women's clubs and the Chautautjuan assem- blies, especially those at Ocean Park. Her chiu'ch affiliations were with the Free Baptist denomination.
