The education of Mabel Loomis, received largely at the Georgetown Seminary, was sup- plemented by two or three years' study in Bos- ton, her special attention being given to Ger- man* painting, and music, vocal and instru- mental, inchuling a thorough course in har- mony under Stephen A. Emery. After spend- ing one winter in the gay society of Washington, she was married March 5, 1879, to David P. Todd, then connected with the Unitetl States Naval Observatory in that city. Soon after- ward Mr. Todd received a call to the chair of astronomy in Amherst College (his Alma Mater), being made director of its observatory and also professor of the higlier mathematics at Smith College.

Mrs. Todd has always taken nmch interest in her husband's work. In 1887 and again in 1896 she accompanied him to Japan to observe the eclipses of the sun. The second eclipse they viewed from Yezo, the most northern island of the empire. Here, in a little fishing village bordering the Sea of Okhotsk, she made a study of the Ainu, tlie barbarian aborigines of Japan, in a region never before visited by a foreign woman. She made a collection of their utensils, garments, and ornaments, for the

Peabody Musemn in Salem. In the spring of 1900 she joined the Professor at Tripoli, in Barbary, whither he had gone to observe the sun's eclipse of May 28. Early in 1901 Profes- sor and Mrs. Todd, this time accompanied by their daughter, Millicent, then a stu&lt;lent at \'assar College, sailed for Singapore, afterward locating the Amherst College Eclipse Expedi- tion on the island of Singkep^ in the Dutch East Indies, where the phenomenon was ob- sei-ved on May 18. Trips were made later to Siam and Borneo, and several weeks were spent in the Philippines, where with General Corbin they made a tour of the archipelago. A visit to China, a third visit to Japan, and a short stay at the Hawaiian Islands completed the circuit of the globe for this expedition. Mrs Todd has contributed many articles to the Na- tion, the Outlook, St. Nicholas, the Century, and other magazines. " Footprints," her first book, was publishetl in 1883. In 1890 she edited the first volume of the posthumous poems of Emily Dickinson, which met with instant success, and in 1891 she edited a second volume. In 1894 slie edited two volumes of Miss Dickinson's letters, and also published a volume upon "Total Eclipses of the Sun," the only standard popular work upon that subject. In the autumn of 1896 a third volume of Emily Dickinson's poems, as well as "A Cycle of Sonnets" by an anony- mcjus author, appearetl under her editorship.

In 1898 appeared, published by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., "Corona and Coronet," a narra- tive of the unique yachting trip to Japan in search of the eclipse of 1896. Her revised ver- sion of Steele's " Fourteen Weeks in Astronomy " was published in 1900.

" Mrs. Todd," as well remarked by one who speaks not idly, "is a woman of many talents. A student of art and science, she is also a viva- cious and attractive speaker, welcome every- where on the platform, as in society." Each season for several years she has given more than fifty drawing-room talks, and addresses in halls, churches, schools, and club parlors, upon subjects coimected with popular astronomy, Japan in various aspects, the Ainu, the Hawai- ian Islands, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, the PhilipjMnes, the Alhambra, Carthage, the Ober- ammcrgau Passion Play, Tripoli, and on other
