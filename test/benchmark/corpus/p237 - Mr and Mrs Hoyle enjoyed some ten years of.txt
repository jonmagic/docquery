To lend a helping hand to every worthy cause, not grudging either money or personal service, to extend to the poor and unfortunate both helpful atlvice and pecuniary aid, to do all that lay in her power to make the world Ijetter and brighter — this was the self-inijiosed mission wliich she nobly fulfilled. She was an incorporator and one of the trustees of the Maiden Hos- pital; one of the original incorporators in Maiden of the Y. M. C. A.; and a trustee and at the time of her death one of the board of managers of the Home for Aged People in Maiden. To each of these institutions she made generous bequests — one thousand dol- lars to the hospital, two thousand dollars to the Y. M. C. A., and a .similar amount to the Home for Ageil People. She also l(&gt;ft three hunilred dollars to the city of Medford to main- tahi perpetually a drinking fountain, erected by her at the corner of Spring and Salem .Streets, also the same amount to the city of Maiden for the permanent care of a drinking fountain previously erected by her in Jud.son Square, Maiden. She left the cities of Med- ford and Maiden several similar amounts for the care of her lot in Salem Street Cemetery ; Maiden, the care of her father's lot in Oak Grove Cemetery, Medford, and for the care of the lot of her former husliand, Mr. Teele, in Medford. To the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals she left two thousand dollars. Wilbraham Academy received from her the gift of one thousand dollars. Her memory is perjjetuated in the Centre Meth- odist Church of Malilen by her gift of a silver communion service. The residue of her fortune, excepting some i)rivate bequests, was left to Mr. Hoyle.

Mrs. Hoyle was a constant attendant at the First Congregational Church, the pastor of which, the Rev. H. H. French, officiated a4 her funeral, assisted by the pastor of the Centre Methotlist Church, the Rev. Mr. Hughes. A womanly woman and a practical Christian, she left behind a fragrant memory of her life and character that shall long endure.
