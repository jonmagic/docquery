Her eldest son, Walter, returned from Cuba broken in health from yellow fever, and was obliged to leave the bleak climate of New England for the Far West. For this reason Mrs. Packard in 1901 resigned her position as literary editor of the Springfield Daily News, and moved to Portland, Ore.

In her new home she is still actively engaged in public work She has been patriotic instructor and also ])ress corresj)oiKlent of George ^^ right Relief Corps of Portland, Ore., and in 190;i was elected a national delegate to the Woman's Relief Corps convention in San Francisco. Her interest in the old soldiers is as strong as ever. She is correspondent for several liast- ern papers. After the close of the National Pmcampment at Buffalo the Tmies of that city said, " Of all the hundreds of press con-espond- ents who sent out letters describing the en- campment, none equalled in graphic descrip- tion those sent by 'H. N. P.' to the Spring- field Republican." Mrs. Packard represented the same paper in 1903 at the Frisco encamp- ment, where she received a cordial greeting from a host of Grand Army comrades. Mrs.

Packartl has held several offices in the United Order of the Pilgrim Fathers, including that of Governor of the Colony in Springfield. She is also a member of Mercy Warren Chapter, of Springfield, of the Daughters of the American Revolution. When a resident of Massachu- setts she was identified with the New England Woman's Press A.ssociation. As her works testify, she is a woman of talent ami of much executive ability.

Mrs. Packard has had rather more than the ordinary share of troubles which fall to the lot of mortals, but has borne all her many trials with fortitutle and cheerfulness, always hold- ing the faith that some good purpose underlies all the worries of humanity. Her New Eng- land birth and training, and inheritance of courage from a long line of ancestors, have doubtless ujihcld her where others would have failed.

Mrs. Packard now receives the pension of a Ijieutenant's widow, secured to her by special act of Congress through the efforts of the Hon. Malcolm A. Moody, Representative from the Second Congressional District of Oregon.

MARY E. ALLEN.â€” At the time of the French Revolution it is related that two young brothers were sent away from France, and sailed from their native town of Brest, in two different vessels, for America. One of them was never heard from more. The other, as he told the story, was shipwrecked off the coast of Massachu- setts, reacheil the shore with some difficulty, in scanty clothing, and sought refuge at the nearest farmhouse, where he was taken in and given work. He could speak no English, and, as the people he came among were equally ignorant of his language, the farmer sought the nearest equivalent in soimd to the name given by the stranger, and called him Cornelius Allen. This name he afterward bore, re- maining a resilient of Massachusetts, where he married and had a large family. His son Joseph married Mary Nowell, of York, Me. She was of Scotch and English descent. The youngest of their six children was Mary E. Allen, the subject of this sketch, who was born
