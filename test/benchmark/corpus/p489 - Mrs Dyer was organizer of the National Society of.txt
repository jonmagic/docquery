of the Boston Art C-lub in four successive years. Her work was represented at all the exhibi- tions of the Portland Society of Art. One of her landscapes was thus mentioned : " The live, graceful treatment of the long ranks of willows, the shadowy foreground, contrasting with the airy, sunlighted middle distance, all suggest the great French master, Corot"; again, "The work is strong, showing almost a masculine touch." Of the three pictures that she exhibited at the Midwinter Fair in San Francisco a critic said, "Tiie man who painted these pictures knew his Inisiness." She made many sketches while in the Sierras and Yosemite Valley. She has devoted much time to teaching, being instructor of drawing and painting at Westbrook Seminary, Portland, Me.
