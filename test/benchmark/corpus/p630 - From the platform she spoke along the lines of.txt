From the platform she spoke along the lines of reform in way of "Equal Suffrage," "Prog- ress in the Aims and Methods of Education," "Rights and Wrongs of the Indians," "Duties of Government," "Literature," "Travel," and other miscellaneous topics.

Miss Eastman could scarcely have received more encouragement than she did in her public career, whether from her audiences, the press, or from the leaders of thought throughout the

country. Her arguments were always logical and given with candor. That she had the faculty of captivating her audience is abun- dantly shown, but it was accomplished by no meretricious arts or display.

The Lawrence American said, " Miss East- man's address displayed the thinking, philo- sophic i)Ower of analysis of John Stuart Mill, while the earnestness of her manner proved clearly the earnestness of her sentiments."

The St. Louis Globe said: "Miss Howe ad- dresses you. Miss Eastman talks to you. With a subtle and effective sarcasm she laughs you out of your prejudices. She reasons with you. With an eloquence that stirs your blood, she rouses you from your apathy; and, having said all this and much more, she leaves the platform, while the audience applauds her to the echo."

The Pittsburg correspondent of the Cin- cinnati Commercial said : " Miss Eastman is undoubtedly one of the largest-brained women in America. A clear, logical thinker and a woman of scholarly training, she has thought out for herself the questions with which she deals, and she hits the nail on the head every time.

"I did not say she was a ' ^rai'C woman ' : she is one of the brightest, merriest women alive. I said she was a grand woman, and I'd like to say it again."

Colonel T. W. Higginson, in an article on "How to Speak," after expressing the great delight to his ear of listening to a perfectly tlistinct and clear-cut utterance, says, "If you wish to know what I mean by a clear and satisfactory utterance, go to hear Miss East- man speak." Again he says: "She is a thinker, not a mere agitator. She always has something fresh to Say, and her talk is up to the day."

Wendell Phillips, after listening to one of her speeches, commented on her " words of eminent wisdom."

Mrs. Howe contributes her word for the pub- lishers of this book : " Miss ICastman is a woman of superior culture and abiUty, eloquent with pen and tongue. Her interest in public ques- tions has made her gifts available for the bene- fit of the community in which she has long had her home. She ^^as always been an ardent

advocate of woman suffrage. She was a valued officer of the Association for the Advancement of Women, a pioneer company wliose wide- spread labors did much to render possible the general federation of women's clubs, which now embraces every State in the Union."
