These words are the end of this written rec- ord of a woman's love and trust; for in this "great and good world" there were certain men at the South who about that time trained their cannon on the starred and striped flag of the government which " would not suffi- ciently Jet them eat their bread in the sweat of other men's faces"; and so woman's love and trust, and joy of peaceful ministry everywhere, were whelmed in the crash and mauling antl woe of a mighty Civil War — a war which taught the braggart tyrant fcjrces of the world that the most terrible foemen on earth are the "woman-hearted" men who love their fair, free homes and simple fireside joys, but who will fight when fight they nuist, or see the truth crushed down forever.
