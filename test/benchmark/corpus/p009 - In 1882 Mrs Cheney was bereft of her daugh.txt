was fitted up and named for her the "Margaret Swan Cheney Reading Room."

Since 1863 Mrs. Cheney has made her home in Jamaica Plain. Her interest in things that make for Imman welfare and progress con- tinues unabated. Her voice in these later days is yet occasionally heard in pulilic, and her pen is still that of a ready if not constant writer.

Mrs. Howe, speaking from the standpoint of long and intimate acquaintance, says: "Mrs. Ednah Dow Cheney is one of the marked per- sonalities of the last fifty years in her native town of Boston. In ail this period of time she has been prominent in movements of sound and needed reform. Naturally averse to per- sonal publicity, she has not shunned it where her name and word could add weight to the atlvocacy of a just cause. In the education and health of the comnmnity she has shown the most lively interest. She has been a strenu- ous champion of the claims of the colored race to political and social justice. She has hatl much at heart the spread of religious tolera- tion and the enfranchisement of her own sex. One who has been proud and glad to work with her may say that she has always found her a woman of good counsel and of reliable judg- ment. Motives of i)ersonal advancement are foreign to her nature. Her life has been en- riched by true culture, by the love of all that is beautiful in art, -literature, and character. The good work which she has contributed to the tasks of her day and generation will surely endure, and should be held, with her imme, in loving and lasting remembrance."

Among the books that Mrs. Cheney has writ- ten or edited may be named the following: "Handbook for American Citizens" (written for the freedmen of the South), 1864; "Faith- ful to the Light," 1872; "Sally Williams," 1872; "Child of the Tide," 1874;' "Gleanings in the Fields of Art," 1881; Life, Letters, and Journals of Louisa M. Alcott, 1889; Memoirs of her husband, Seth W. Cheney, of her daugh- ter, Margaret S. Cheney, and of the distinguished engraver, John Cheney; "Stories of the Olden Time," 1890; "Life of Ranch, the Sculptor"; "Reminiscences," December, 1902.
