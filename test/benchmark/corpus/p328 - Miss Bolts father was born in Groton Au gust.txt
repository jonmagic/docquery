REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

When Mr. Scuckler established the Allstou Mills at AUston, Mass., for the manufacture of ho- siery and children's scarlet-wool goods, she ac- cepted the supcrin tendency of the new enter- prise, which she retained for five years, or until the property was sold.

Desirous of connecting lierself with a busi- ness in which she could have a personal finan- cial interest, she formed a partnership with Charles N. Winship, formerly of the Dudley Mill and afterwanl foreman of the knitting department of the Allston Mill. In 1888 the firm of AVinship, Boit &amp; Co. established the Harvard Knitting Mill at Cambridge, Mass., from which city they moved to Wakefield in the following year, and resumed operations in the Wakefielcl Block, occupying one floor. They inaugurated their enterprise with a small capital but with a thorough knowledge of the business, Miss Boit assuming charge of the finances as well as the general superintendency of the finishing department, while Mr. Winshi]) attended to the knitting and other branches of the work. The laudable aim of placing gooils upon the market whicli .should be a credit to themselves, serving also to elevate the stand- ard of the American textile fabric industry, resulted in securing such a wide popularity and increasing demanil for the Harvard brand of imderwear as to make necessary the enlarge- ment of their facilities from time to time, until they were at length compelled to erect a build- ing for their exclusive use.
