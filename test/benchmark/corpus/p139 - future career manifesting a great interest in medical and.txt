future career, manifesting a great interest in medical and surgical subjects, experimenting on the broken legs of fowls, and improving every opportunity of gaining a knowledge of the heal- ing processes of nature. She was educated in the public schools of Montpelier, including the high school, and at the Montpelier Seminary. In accortlance with the desire of her parents, she then engaged in teaching, but after a while, having become dissatisfied with her acquire- ments, she entered the School of Cognate Lan- guages at Morgan Park, near Chicago, 111., where she studied untler the direction of Profes- sor W. R. Harper, now the President of Chicago University.

About this time occurred the death of her father and eldest brother, William H. Gary, and under the severe mental strain occasioned by the double bereavement her health gave way, anil she was prostrated by a severe illness. Naturally of a frail physique, she was left in an impaired condition, which finally resulted in lameness, compelling her to use a crutch. Ac- tive and sensitive in her temperament, she was led through this cause to desire to occupy her mind and time with some clearly defined work pertaining to the good of others. Fearing op- position on account of her health, she secretly con- sulted with her brother, Frank E. H. Gary, Esq., and at his request entered in 1882 the Boston I'niversity School of Metlicine, from which she was gratluated in 1885. In 1884 she received an appointment as house surgeon in the Massa- chusetts Homoeopathic Hospital, being the first woman who had that honor; and she was acting in this capacity at the time of her graduation. In the meanwhile her health and strength im- proved untler the skilful care and guidance of Dr. Conrad Wesselhoeft and Dr. J. Heber Smith.

In September, 1885, she openeil her first office at 767 Tremont Street, Boston. Here the early struggles of her practice commenced. She kept in touch with college anil ilispeii- sary work, holding the positions of pharmacist to the dispensary and physician to one of the children's clinics. Becoming very much inter- ested in el(&gt;ctricity as applied to medicine, she entered the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology for study of the science, in order to lay

a good foundation for work in that line, attend- ing the lectures outside of her office hours. Afterward she studied electricity as applied to medicine under Dr. Rockwell in the Post- graduate School of New York City. In 1888 she removed her office to 546 Columbus Avenue, Boston, where she continued her work as a general practitioner and electrotherapeutist for twelve years. At the end of that periotl the death of her mother, to whom she was devotedly attached, so affected her health that she felt compelled to temporarily relin- quish her practice. 8he then went to Europe for the double purpose of recuperating and of studying more deeply the science of elec- trotherapeutics. The latter object was ac- complished under Dr. Planet, of Paris, France, the skilled assistant of the late Dr. Apostle, and in the large hospital at Vienna. When she returned to Boston, .she removed her office to "The Marlborough," 416 Marlborough Street, where she is now practising.
