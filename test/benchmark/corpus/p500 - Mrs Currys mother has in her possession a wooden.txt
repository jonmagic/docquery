while a prisoner, during the War of 1812, on a British war-ship in New York Harbor.

Mrs. Curry was graduated at Cook's Collegi- ate Institute, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1873. Before she was sixteen years old, she attracted unusual attention in the work done at the closing exercises of Gary Institute. Friends at that time predicted a successful future in public work.

Soon after graduating she was tendered a position as teacher of elocution in the Mil- waukee Female College. At the end of one year she was offered the position for ten years, with an annual increase in salary; but the desire to study was stronger than financial inducements, and in 1875 Miss Baright came to Boston.

Professor Lewis B. Monroe, Dean of the Boston University School of Oratory, recog- nized her powers, and under his influence she continued her studies. In 1877 she was gradu- ated from the School of Oratory with the highest class honors, and appointed by the faculty to represent the class of 1877 at the first Boston University commencement, held in Tremont Temple. Her theme on this oc- casion was "Elocution as a Fine Art," in which she matle an appeal, not for one art, but for Art. Miss Baright's enthusiasm on this oc- casion was contagious, ami an audience of three thousand responded to her ideals with a fervor almost unheard of at a college com- mencement.

Thus Miss Baright became associated with the beginnings of the progressive movement in the arts of the spoken word, which has culminated in the School of Expression, Bos- ton, of which S. S. Curry, Ph.D., is president.

At the opening exercises of the School of Oratory in the fall of 1877 Miss Baright, then a teacher in the school, gave a reading of Mrs. Browning's " Rhyme of the Duche.'^s May." The lyric possibilities of the ])oem were com- bined with the most discriminating imperso- nation, and all the subtler variety of treatment brought into unity about the slender thread of a story. Professor Monroe called her aside after this reading and .said, " I do not wish to lo.se you as a teacher, but it is only right for you to know that your power point's

you to the platform." She did not take up platform work, however, professionally, but has directed her powers to train and develop the art instinct in others.

In July, 1879, she opened at Martha's Vine- yard the first summer school of oratory held in the United States. Professor Monroe was to have conducted this school, with Miss Baright as an assistant. He was taken ill about the date set for the opening. He telegraphed to Miss Baright to go on and attend to the work. His death occurred on the first day of the school, and, although several other teachers were in attendance, indecision and lack of leader- ship seemed to threaten the disbanding of the students. Miss Baright saw the situation, anfl, with her characteristic readiness to meet emer- gencies, organized the school, divided it into classes, placed them under teachers, and start(&gt;d the work, inspiring the confidence that held all the students assembled at Martha's Y'lnf}- yard for the five weeks' term.
