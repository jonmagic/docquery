LAVINA J. SPAULDING (Mrs. William C. Spaulding), president of the Aroos- ^ took County Woman's Christian Tem- perance Union, was born in Pugwash, N.S., but from early childhood has been a resi- dent of Maine. Her ])arents, John and Sarah (King) Sterling, were natives of Halifax, N.S., and both came of good olil Kngli.sh stock. Her grandparents on the motiier's side were Charles and Sarah King, and on her father's side were Captain John and Margaret Sterling, of Hali- fax, N.S.

When Lavina Sterling was too young to remember very distinctly the place of her na- tivity or to have any strong affiliations there- with, her parents removcnl to Fort Fairfield, Me. She was thus reared and educated under the American flag, and is intensely American in all her instincts and proclivities.

It was in the pioneer days of Northern Maine, when the location of the north-eastern boundary was a mooted (piestion between the govern- ments of the United States and Great Britain, that the Sterling home was established in the frontier town of J'^ort Fairfield. .John Sterling, the father, at once became one of the feading men of the little settlement, which at that time was merely an opening in the grand old "forest primeval," where a few hardy and adventurous spirits, like himself, had penetrated the wilder- ness and made homes for themselves and fam- ilies.

His house was the central point of the new settlement and the hospitable abiding-place of all strangers who cnme ff)r a temjiorary stay in the little forest village. The locality had

been one of the most imjjortant points in the famous Aroostook War, when the State of Maine made its brave and manly protest against the encroachments of British greed; and a log fort and blockhouse had been there erected under Governoi- Fairfield's admin- istration, thus giving the name to the frontier town.

liefore the glowing fire of hard-wood logs, piled high upon the ample hearth, the younger members of the Sterling family listened to the stories of the stirring times when the homes of the villagers were upon "disputed territory," and when Great Britain was striving to gain permanent possession of this fair land. Amid these healthful natural surroundings was the youth of Lavina Sterling passed, and within the influence of these stui'dy conditions was her character" formed. Here she early imbibed those sterling ((ualities of mind and heart which .she has continued to retain, even after the union with the man of her choice brought with it a. change of name.
