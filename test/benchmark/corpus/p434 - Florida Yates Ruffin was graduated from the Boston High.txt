Florida Yates Ruffin was graduated from the Boston High and Normal Schools, and was the second colored woman to receive an appoint- ment as teacher in the public schools of Boston. She is now the wife of U. A. Ridley and the mother of two children. As the first secretary of the Woman's Era Club and one of its leading members, she aided her mother in making a great success of the first convention of colored women in the country.

Stanley Ruffin, a graduate of the Massachu- setts Institute of Technology and an inventor, is the general manager and treasurer of a man- ufacturing company in Boston.

George L. Ruffin, the youngest son, is a graduate of the English High School of Boston. He has marked musical ability, and for some years he was a boy soprano at the Church of the Advent. He is a member of the vested choir of Trinity Church, Boston, has been a member of the Handel and Haydn Society and of the Cecilia Musical Society, and is now the organist of St. Augustine's Church, Boston.

At an early age Mrs. Ruffin became iden- tified with reform movements: the advance- ment of woman and the welfare of the colored race, especially of the children, were (juestions that strongly appealed to her sympathies. At the time when, after the close of the Civil War, many colored people were fleeing from oppres- sion in the South and pouring into Kansas, often arriving in destitute circumstances, she called the women of her neighborhood at the West End together for the purjxxse of devising ways and means of helping the needy refugees. An organization was formed, named the Kansas Relief Association, of whicli she was made presi- dent. Under her direction and aided by the wise counsels of William Lloyd (iarrison, work was immediately begun, and carried forward with zeal and alacrity, resulting in the shipment to Kansas of many bales and boxes of clothing, both new and old, and also in the sending of money through Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.

Success in this philanthropic effort led to co-operation with the A.ssociated Charities, then just starting in Boston, Mrs. Ruffin acting as a visitor for about eleven years. She also

joined in the work of the Country Week So- ciety, devoting herself to the task, considered exceptionally difficult, of finding places in the country for colored chiklren.

Mrs. Ruffin has been for many years an ac- tive member of the Massachusetts Moral Edu- cational A.ssociation and of the Massachusetts School Suffrage Association and a member of the executive board of each. As editor of the Woman's Era, she has the privilege of membership in the New England Woman's Press Association. The Woman's Era (now dormant, December, 1903, but with hopes of being revived) was the organ of the colored women of America, and exerted an influence that was widely recognized.

Mrs. Ruffin was one of the founders of the Association for the Promotion of Child-training in the South, which has accomplished good re- sults. It is interested in a school at Atlanta, Ga., among whose regular visitors were several prominent women of that State.
