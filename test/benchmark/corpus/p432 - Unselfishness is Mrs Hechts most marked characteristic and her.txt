Unselfishness is Mrs. Hecht's most marked characteristic, and her whole life has been filled with thought and service for others. Although she forgets herself, her gracious image is enshrined in many hearts. Her friends enjoy fier sympathetic temperament and graceful presence, antl the poor, who are also her friends, praise her kind heart and generosity.

As the Hebrew matron of old, so "she spread- eth out wide her open palm to the poor. She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is on her tongue.

"Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she smileth at the coming of the last day. Let her own works praise her in the gates."

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

by the Rev. Dr. William Jenks, of the Green Street Church (Trinitarian Congregational).

Jean Japfiiies St. Pierre, father of John St. Pierre and grandfather of Mrs. Ruffin, came to Massachusetts from Martinique probably early in the nineteenth century, and, settling in Taunton, married Betsey Hill, of that town. She, Mrs. Betsey Hill St. Pierre, grandmotlier of Mrs. Ruffin, was the grand-daughter of an African prince, who, having been sent by his father to conduct a gang of slaves to the sea- coast, was himself kidnapped and brought to America. Landing in a Northern seaport, he escaped from his captors, and made his way to an Indian settlement in the vicinity of Taunton. Being kindly received, he married an Indian girl, became a land-owner, and, es- tablishing a home, reared a family, which was called by the country people "the royal family."

This history, which has been handed down from former generations to the pi'esent, is at- tested in part by ancient land deeds and other papers, which Mrs. Ruffin has in her jxjsse.ssion. In one of these time-worn documents the re- quest is made that the original estate be kept as a safe refuge for such of the family as shall be living in the time of a great and bloody war, foretold by the African-born ancestor as surely coming to break the bonds of the slave.

It may here be added concerning the invol- untary but, so far as appears, contented exile, that in "the sunset of life" he came to be looked upon as a seer and a prophet, and a collection of his prophecies was printed in a pamphlet, a copy of which is kept among the family papers. The original farm, " Rocky Woods," of which he was the owner, is still held and occupied by one of his descendants. On this farm is the family burial-place.
