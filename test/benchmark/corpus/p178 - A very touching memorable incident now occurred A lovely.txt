A very touching, memorable incident now occurred. A lovely little babe, seven months oki, the infant daughter of Darius and Laura, died the same day her grandmother died, so that those who parted with her could but be- hold her, in their faith's vision, received into the grandmother's arms in greeting, she never having seen the child in this life. Her little casket was placed beside the casket of the grandmother, antl as the members of the In- stitute passed by, to look for the last time upon the features of their tenderljj: remembered presi- dent, their eyes were unexpectedly greeted by the sight of this little babe, sweetly sleeping its last sleep by the side of its grandmother. Many were the responsive tears from those who wit- nessed this scene. It seemed as if enacted by Heaven itself, to impress upon our hearts the memory of that blessed mother in Israel, who so loved the little children and ever made them so happy.

When the little child was drawing her last breath, her eyes were fixed upward with a mar- vellously heaven-inspired gaze, ere their earthly lids were forever closed, ^^'hat she there saw only Heaven knows. In their souls' vision the parents have always seen that sainted grand- mother, whom the Sabbath morning bells had ushered into heaven, awaiting, while the even- ing bells of the same holy Sabbath were usher- ing in her dear grandchild.

At the grave the avin sons, Cyrus and Darius, kept their promise. Sylvanus, Samuel Tucker,

aiyi Eben expressed to the assembled friends their love and reverence for their mother, whose mortal remains were about to be con- signed to the earth, when Cyrus and Darius began to sing, as they never had before, "Nearer, my God, to Thee." Those assembled united with them, and the very hills and forest seemed to join in that sublime hymn. Fitting music to accompanj' the droj)])ing of the cur- tain on the final act, directed by the radiant angel of death and immortality.

ALMEDA HALL COBB.- The life of

/\ Almeda Hall Cobb exemplifies Mary

X \. A. Livermore's saying that " fighting

and war have been the main business

of the world, in which women take no part,

save to endvire and suffer."

Born August 27, 1S34, in the quaint, beauti- ful town of Marshfield, on Massachusetts Bay, she was the daughter of William and Sarah (Kent) Hall. Her lineage was partly from the "Mayflower's" first company, Standish, White, and Brewster stock being among the blend in the ancestry of her mother, Sarah Kent. Her father, William Hall, of a line of South Shore ship-builders, was a man sterling in character.

Alnieda's nature was, during her girlhood, sprightly and winsome to a degree that matte her presence a perpetual delight. Brimful of music, it was her singing in the choir of the Rev. vSylvanus Cobb's church that stirred his son, George Winslow Col)b, to woo and win Almeda Hall for his wife. There was appro- priateness in the mating, for her husband's line of ancestry was direct from Elder Henry Cobb, of Plvmouth and Barnstable, an immi- grant of 1629.
