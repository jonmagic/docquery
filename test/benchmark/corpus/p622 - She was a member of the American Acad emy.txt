She was a member of the American Acad- emy of Arts and Sciences; the American Philo- sophical Society of Philadelphia; the New England Women's Club; the New York Soro- sis; and the Association for the Advancement of Women, of which she was the president in 1875 and 1876. Referring to the two annual congresses of the Association held during her official term, one of its founders says of Miss

Mitchell: "She is remembered with especial affection by those who were with her on these occasions. Her tact and ability as a presiding officer were remarkable, and her judgment re- garding the matter to be presented to the public was very valuable. At the congress held in Philadelphia in the centennial year it was desired by some that the meeting should be opened with prayer. Mi.ss Mitchell decided, to the general content of the assembly, that a few minutes should be devoted to the silent prayer of the Friends."

She was three times the recipient of honorary degrees, the third being the LL.D. conferred by Columbia College in 1887.

She made two trips abroad, the second in the summer of 1873, when she went to Russia, visiting St. Petersburg and other cities and the government observatory at Pultowa. While a true lover of her own country as pre-eminently the land of freedom and self-government, she looked for and saw the good in other lands. As she expressed it: "We travel to learn; and I have never been in any country where they did not do something better than we do it, think some thoughts better than we think, catch some inspiration from heights above our own â€” as in the art of Italy, the learning of England, the philosophy of Germany."

Her faith in the coming woman led her to write, " When the American girl carries her energy into the great questions of humanity, into the practical problems of life, when she takes home to her heart the interests of edu- cation, of government, of religion, what may not be hoped for our country! "
