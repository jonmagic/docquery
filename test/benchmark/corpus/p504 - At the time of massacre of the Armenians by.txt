At the time of massacre of the Armenians by the Turks, in 1896, Frances E. Willard and Lady Henry Somerset sent about two hundred refugees to New York. By cable they recjuested Mrs. Fessenden among others to receive them at Ellis Islanil, and to overcome if possible the construction of law that might bar them from admission.

In carrying out her part of this work it be- came necessary for Mrs. Fessenden to visit New York three times, consulting with the commis- sioner of immigration and addressing ministers' meetings to secure their signatures to a petition to the United States government to call the.se jjeople "refugees" and not "immigrants." By this wording it was possible to avoid violat- ing a most beneficent law. It was necessary also for her to secure the signing of the bond for forty thousand dollars. The W. C. T. U. had to pledge that none of the refugees should ever claim government support. W'hen these details had been arranged, one hundred refugees went to the Massachusetts W. C. T. U. and one hundred to the Salvation Army. "With her one hundred Mrs. Fessenden took the ferry from Ellis Island, while from the grateful hearts of those who had gathere&lt;l to help rose the beauti- tiful " Prai.se God, from whom all blessings flow."

To find work for these refugees ignorant of the language and customs of our country was a gigantic task. It fell chiefly on Mrs. Ruth Baker, the Corres])onding Secretary, Mrs. Fessen- den's clo.se friend. At one time Mrs. I'essenden herself had a thrilling experience in rescuing some of these men from a place whitlier they had been led by false representations. It

was a stronghold of outlaws in the Virginia mountains that she had to visit in order to accomplish her purpose; and it was through the exercise of the greatest tact and promj)tness that she succeeded in bringing the men away.

As President of the W. C. T. U., Mrs. Fessen- den had many interesting experiences. One of these was when, through the invitation from the captain and chaplain, she conducted on the United States warship "Massachusetts" a Sunday service which was attended by sailors from three vessels. Another was the occasion when she presided at the banquet and reception to Lady Henry Somerset at Music Hall ; and a third at Hotel \'endome, the breakfast to Frances E. Willard, at which there were six hundred guests.

An experience of a different kind, which she felt her office required of her, was a visit she made to the slums, that she might see for her- self life in its various phases. Accomjianied by two policemen, she spent the entire night irt the worst part of Boston, visiting Cliinose and Italian quarters, police stations, and so- called hotels.

In 1899 Mrs. Fessenden had a second great loss in the death of her only son, AVilliam Chaffin Fessenden, who had been graduated from An- dover in 1898, and had entered upon his first pastorate at New Boston, Mass. He was a young man of high promise, both as preacher and thinker.
