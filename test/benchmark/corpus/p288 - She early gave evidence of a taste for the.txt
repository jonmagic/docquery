She early gave evidence of a taste for the profession that she subsequently adopted. When only fourteen years of age she was often called ujjon from all parts of the town to sit up with and care for the sick. From the work of a nurse to the calling of a physician was, for one of her bent, a natural step, and after some years of diligent application to study she received her medical diploma from Boston University. Selecting Maiden as her field of labor, she at once opened an office in that city, where she has since resided and practisetl. Starting with a sound theoretical knowledge of both medicine and surgery, she has since ac- quired that accuracy of diagnosis and skill in treatment that comes only after years of actual practice, and then only to those who are fitted by nature, inclination, and training for the healing profession. To these necessary qual- ities she adds an address that invites the con- fidence of her patients and a personal character that commands for her the respect of the com- numity in which she lives.

Dr. Russell has not accumulated for herself any considerable amount of this world's goods, but her deeds of charity and benevolence, both in the bestowal of personal service and the giving of money, have laid up for her a wealth of gratitude in the hearts of the many recipients and in her own the reward that comes to those who have learned that it is "more blessed to give than to receive." Her natural kindness is shown in the adoption of two daughters, one some twenty years ago and the other within the last five years, antl both under circumstances that show a mother's de- votion and love. Dr. Russell is a member of the Massachusetts Homa-opathic Medical So- ciety, the Boston Homoeopathic Medical Society, and various local medical societies. She at- tends the Protestant Episcopal church of Maiden.

MARY J. PRESCOTT FADES, the subject of this sketch, is a daughter of sturdy old New England blood, coming from Scotti.sh ancestry. In the year 1608 was born in Scotland Deacon John Leavitt, who came to America in 1628 and settled in Hingham, Mass. Of his descend- ants among the best known are Moses Leavitt, his .son, antl Dudley Leavitt, his great-great- grandson, who was so named from Governor Thomas Dudley, to whom his family was re- lated. The life of Dudley Leavitt was sjient in the (at that time not inconsistent) occupa- tions of teacher and farmer. Though in all he had not more than three months' schooling, he was a student by nature and spent every leisure moment in study, so that at the age of twenty he was well groun&lt;le(l in all the science of that day, especially in mathematics, and able to give instruction in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, navigation, gunnery, astronomy.
