ginning there at the lowest round of the ladder. She felt that this was the opportunity for which she had been looking, and determined to make the most of it by doing her work well. Her energy and faithfulness soon attracted the attention of the officers of the company, and they tlecided to make the experiment of placing her in charge of a department of the business that had previously been con- ducted entirely by men engaged as travelling agents.

The mere mention of employing a woman in that capacity was regarded as preposterous. Nevertheless, she began to travel for the com- pany, and immediately proved herself capable of doing the work assigned her in a satisfactory manner. She installed steam laundry plants all over the United States, instructing opera- tives in the running of the machines, and gained a reputation as an authority in this branch of the business. It was hard, exact- ing, fatiguing work, and after a time, wishing to settle in a permanent location, she accepted a position as suj)erintendent and manager of one of the largest steam laundries in the East. This position she held eighteen years, resigning it two or three years ago to embark in her present enterprise, establishing and carry- ing on a steam laundry in the Allston district of Boston. The "Mayflower Laundry," as it is called, has been conducted with her usual energy, industry, and honesty, and with such signal ability that it is a pronounced success, ranking as a first-class establishment of its kind and a credit to its proprietor and man- ager.
