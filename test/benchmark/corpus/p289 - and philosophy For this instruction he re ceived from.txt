and philosophy. For this instruction he re- ceived from each |)ui)il the generous tuition fee of three dollars a ([uarter. At the age of twenty-two he married Judith Glidden, of Gil- manton, N.H. They resided in that town until 1806, when he removed to Meredith, N.H., wliich was his home for the remaintler of his life.

With all his teaching and other work, he found time to make jjractical use of his scien- tific attainments in the compilation of a farmers' almanac. His first edition of this was published in 1797, his last in 1858. He died in 1851, leaving one edition in the press and six others in manuscript, a total of sixty-two continuous issues. He taught some portion of every year until he was seventy-four, and at the same time carried on his farm. After his marriage he studied Greek and Latin, and later in life Hebrew and several of the modern lan- guages. He made the calculations for the New Hampshire and Freewill Bapti.st Registers, and was the author of several school text-books, having at the time of his death a work on as- tronomy nearly ready for the press. He was the "most robust style of scholar," thinking that whatever was to be known he must know, And as Prof. Agassiz saitl, should be painted with a book in his hand, others filling his pockets, and knowledge sticking out all over his tall head. In the only portrait of him in existence his head and face are very remark- able for intellectuality and a certain childlike yet noble dignity. One of his pupils expres.ses her impression of him as a man who loved knowletlge and reverenced God.

He had eleven children, five boys and six girls. t)ne daughter, Jane, .married the Rev. John L. Seymour, who was a missionary among the Indians from 1832 to 1846. Another, Judith, married the Rev. John Taylor Jones, a missionary at Bangkok, Siam. One son, Dudley, who was fitted for college by his father, was graduated at Dartmouth in 1889, and studied divinity at Andover Theological Semi- nary, but died suddenly before graduation. A younger child, Mary, was no exception to the rest of the family in her ambition to obtain knowledge, and, after she became a devoted â– wife and mother, always found time in the

midst of lier busy household cares to aid ma- terially, spiritually, and intellectually those de- pendent upon her. She was blessed witli a sweet Christian character, antl commanded the respect antl love of all who knew her. About the year 1837 she married Josiah S. Prescott, of Meredith, N.H., whose occupation was that of farmer and carpenter. Mr. Prescott was al- ways active in the public welfare, serving the town on the Board of Selectmen and satisfac- torily representing his district in the State Legislature. They had four boys and two girls.

The fourth child and oldest daughter of Josiah S. and Mary (Leavitt) Prescott is the one whose name heads the present article. Mary J. Prescott was born in Meredith, N.H. As a mere child she displayed great talent for music, shown in her ability to read unfamiliar compositions with correctness of tune and tune. The advantages of a musical education were not sufficiently appreciated as com|)ared with the more practical and utilitarian attain- ments. Consequently her training was con- fined to patient and persistent individual effort and the annual winter singing-school. A\'hile living at home she was a valued memlier of the church choir, and later she acceptably filled the position of leading soprano in several Massa- chusetts churches, being also for a number of years an active member of the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, Mass. Although her instruction on the pianoforte was very limited, she mastered some of the most difficult music. Naturally an earnest and ajjt student, she com- pleted her education at Tilton (N.H.) Seminary, and taught successfully in the district schools of her native State. It may here be said that one of the most pleasant experiences in her etlucational life was the two years spent as a pupil in the Emerson College of Oratory, Bos- ton, Mass.
