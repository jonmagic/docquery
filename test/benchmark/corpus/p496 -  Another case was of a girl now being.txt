" Another case was of a girl now being educated for a missionary. Still another started last week for the South, to become a teacher in a .school for girls. These living testimonies and the thought of my Master's example give me courage to press on with renewed effort and watchfulness over these hopeful ca.ses, to make for them a living reality of the words of the Master when he said,

' Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'

" Do this, antl to many a storm-beaten spirit the midnight darkness of despair will be illumined by the bright sun.shine of hope fulfilled. Of one thousand five hundred and seven women who have been helped this year, eight hundred and ninety-three have been furnished employment, four hundred and twenty-six sent to home and frientls, one lumdred and two sent to hospitals, seven sent to insane asylums, fifty-eight have died, and twenty-one have been married."

MARGARET J. MAGENNIS is one of the best known and most highly respected and beloved among the newspaper women in Boston. In her honor a room was detiicated by the Massa- chusetts Flower Mission of the W. C. T. U. at the New England Home for Deaf Mutes, Allston, on July 11 of the present year, 1904. This tribute is significant of one among the many worthy benevolent enterprises for which Mrs. Magennis has worked with pen and voice. Her literary aptitude was inherited, and she drifted into the work almost as her birthright. Her father was Archibald McMechan, of Norman and Scotch-Irish anc(\stry. He was widely known over the country for liberalism and defence of the tenant farmer. Her mother was Mary Nelson, of Norfolk (England) stock, of which Lord Nelson was a famed member. From her grandmother, Mollie Morehead, she inherited her Scottish blood. Mrs. Magennis was born in Greater Belfast, Ireland. She married young, and was left a widcnv at an early age.

Mrs. Magennis was one of the first repre- sentatives of her sex to engage in the profession of journalism in Boston. Her first contribu- tions to the ])ress ajipeared in the Watchvwii and Reflector in 1868. She was afterward en-

gaged on a suburban weekly, and in 1874 ac- cepted a position on the Boston Traveller, which she still holds.

In the line of special reporting she has done work such as women seldom enter. For ten or twelve years she chronicled the proceedings of one of the municipal courts, and, becoming interested in the criminal class, es])ecially the victims of intemperance, for several years she voluntarily assisted one of the judges in taking men and women on probation. Criminal re- porting was at first repulsive to her sensitive nature, but her loyalty to duty called forth her unhesitating allegiance. Her reluctant task became to her an opportunity for service to the unfortunates of the Tombs. Among the important reportorial work early undertaken by her was that of the intiuest on the death of Katie Curran, whf) was murdered by Jesse Pome- roy. She described the big guns built in South Boston, attended yacht races, and has handled other strong matt(&gt;r.
