If anything more than the terrible campaign in Connecticut were needed to convince Miss Kelley that she had a divine call for public speaking, it was found in the effect produced by the short but eloquent appeal which she made in Pennsylvania Hall, Philadelphia, on the memorable evening of its destruction at the hands of a pro-slavery mob, May IG, 1838. At the close of that meeting, her friend, Theo- dore D. Weld, strongly urged her to join the lecture corps, adding, "Abby, if you don't, God will smite you." But, before a woman could go forth as the accredited agent of the Anti-slavery Society, a battle had to be fought within its own ranks. Witness a letter dic- tated by Mrs. Foster two or three years licfore her death: â€”

" Long before there was any organized move- ment in behalf of the equal rights of women, the battle for the recognition of their equality was fought and won, as an incidental issue,

on the anti-slavery platform. In 1837 Sarah and Angelina (irimke, of South Carolina, were invited to New England to lecture to women on slavery. Meetings were appointed for them in Boston, at which a few men looked in from the vestibule, and finally entered ami took seats. No objections being made to this in- vasion, their sub.seciuent meetings were, largely attended by men as well as women. Meetings were held in many towns in New England, fre- quently in influential churches, the pastors opening with prayer and otherwise giving coun- tenance to the movement. Among the most important hearings given the Grimkes were those before the Legislature of Massachusetts, on petitions. They created an interest that had never been felt before, as witness the action of the Congregational A.'jsociation, which in 1838, by a pastoral letter, written by a com- mittee of which the Rev. Nehemiah Adams was chairman, warned its various churches against giving countenance to women's speak- ing in public assemblies, a movement which was anti-scriptural, umiatural, indecent, and ruinous to the best interests of the comnuuiity.

"These lectures and the action of the Con- gregational Association resulted in a great agi- tation, extending throughout New England, especially in the anti-slavery ranks. No woman hail hitherto taken part in a mixed convention of any of the anti-slavery societies by speaking or serving on committees; but in May, 1838, at the New England Convention, Abby Kelley said a few words from her seat in the hall, and was afterward nominated and elected a member of a conmiittee to memorial- ize the religious associations of Massachusetts in regard to slavery.

"This action, hastily taken in the closing moments of the first .evening, was next day violently opposed by ministers ami others, among them several who had been prominent in aiding the Grinike sisters in their mixed meetings, but who now, under the influence of the i)astoral letter and hostile jiublic .senti- ment, had joined the opposition. These mem- bers, having in vain requested Miss Kelley to withdraw from the connnittee, introduced a resolution excusing her from serving. An intensely exciting discussion followed. The
