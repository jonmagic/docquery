Not long after the production of a third statue, the "Lotos P]ater," she carried out a long-cherished plan of going abroad. With her friend Miss Manning, devoted to another

branch of art, she spent four years in Europe, studying ancient sculpture, drawing, and mod- elling, chiefly in Rome and Paris. In this period she made many sketches and modelled several statues, among them the " Chaldean Astronomer," "Toussaint L'Ouverture," and "Roma." In the latter Miss Whitney personi- fied the Rome of Pio Nono's time, "Childless and crownless in her voiceless woe," a beggar "whose aged and wrinkletl face shows traces of early, majestic beauty. She sits on a broken Corinthian capital, with lier head bowed in profound reverie."

After her return, with increased technical skill, enlarged conceptions of art, and the in- spiration born of years of contact and com- munion with the great masterpieces of the world, Miss Whitney resumed her work in the studio, and continued to design and motlel. She executed several conmiissions for portrait busts, which gave entire satisfaction to the large constituencies interested. Among the.se were busts of President Stearns of Amherst College, President Walker of Harvard, of Gar- rison, of the poet Keats, of Mrs. Livermore, Lucy Stone, Alice Freeman Palmer, and many others. One of her best works is the statue of the Revolutionary patriot, Samuel Adams, which she was commissioned by the State of Massachusetts to execute for the National Gal- lery in Washington, D.C. Of this statue a reproduction in bronze was ordered for the city of Boston; and, having been put in place, it gave the name to Adams S(|uare.

Of later date is Miss Whitney's portrait statue of Harriet Martineau, representing her in the prime of life, sitting in a garden chair, her face raised, her thought far-reaching. This statue was exhibited in Boston in 1888, and is now at Wellesley College.

An ideal figure in bronze, commended as a "work of rare genius in physical detail," and a "notable addition to the put:)lic decorations of the city" of Boston, is that of Leif l&lt;]ric.son, standing on the edge of Back Bay Fens, just beyond Commonwealth Avenue parkway. The dedication of this statue, on October 29, 1887, was an occasioii of rare interest. At a meeting in Faneuil Hall, ])resided over by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, a scholarlv address

relating to the Norscnicn and their tliscover- ies was given by Professor E. N. Horsford.

The statue of Leif Ericson is of heroic size. It stands on a pedestal of red sandstone, being about eighteen feet in height. The figure is symbolical. It represents a youth gazing ea- gerly at the distant horizon, his left hand par- tially shading his eyes, not from the light on sea or land to-tlay, but from the glory of the futui'e, as he dimly forecasts the events of com- ing centuries in the new land that meets his vision. The inscription on one side of the pedestal, giving the date of the voyage of Leif the tliscoverer, is in runic characters. On the opposite side it is in English. A replica of this statue is in Milwaukee on the shore of Lake Michigan.
