but she retains her membership and continues her interest.

The Milford Improvement Society elected her a director when first organized. The Quinshi- paug Woman's Club, of Milford, Hopedale, and Mendon, was organized June 8, 1897, and Mrs. Rockwood was elected treasurer, serving also two years as a director. When the social service department of the club was started, in 1899, she was one of the committee of five appointed to have charge of it. During the two years .she served on this committee the stamp savings system was introduced into some of the schools, meeting with great success. This is one of Mrs. Rockwood 's pet schemes, as she believes in developing habits of thrift among the children of the public schools by encouraging them to save their ))ennies.

She is thoroughly patriotic, and takes a deep interest in all matters relating to the Grand Army of the Republic. As a member of Major E. F.

The Department Convention of Massa- chusetts has at several of its sessions elected her a delegate to National Conventions. , While serving in this capacity she has visited Western and Southern cities, her interest in patriotic work extending throughout the Union.

As Assistant Inspector she -showed such a knowledge of her duties and capability of im- parting instruction that she was appointed Department Inspector in 1901 by Mrs. Maria W. Going, Department President. Her report at the next annual convention covered fifteen printed pages, one paragraph of which shows the variety of work accomplished: "It has been my privilege to visit many of our corps per- sonally, and everywhere I have found the same spirit of charity, loyalty, and helpfulness among my co-workers, and have been cordially re- ceived by them at all times; and, whether standing with them on the top of 'Old Grey-
