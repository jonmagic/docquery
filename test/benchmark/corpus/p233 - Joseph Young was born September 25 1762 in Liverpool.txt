Joseph Young was born September 25, 1762, in Liverpool, N.S., antl died July 31, 1848, about one week after the completion of the monument. At the age of thirteen, in his father's absence, he had nominal charge of the support of the family. That his mother could spare him a few years later is shown by the fact that he himself enlisted before he was sixteen.

The following was recorded by him in later years : â€”

" I was so very small and short of stature that I had to resort to stratagem to pass the very yielding eye of an enlisting officer. I put on a pair of my father's big cowhide boots, and filled under my feet all that I could to raise me up. Then I put on all the clothes I could to make me stout. When I went before the

examining officer, I stretched myself all I could, and was accepted. I was nine months in Jackson's regiment, six months at Provi- dence under Captain Job Crocker, nine months in Shepard's regiment under Captain Grifhths, of Yarmouth, in my father's name, and in the last twenty-four months of the war under Shepard, a part of the time in my father's name and a part in my own, serving in all four years, eight months.

"I stayed until peace was declared, and was discharged back of Newburg before General Washington took possession of New York, without a cent to pay my expenses home, which I reached after suffering many privations, to find my father and family in distressed circumstances, as neither of us had received any compensation for our services. At this time the Continental script was of such depre- ciation in value that a month's wages would not buy a bushel of corn.

" I travelled to Boston to secure our wages, which the government was paying by issuing notes, and fount! that Lieutenant Hamblin of the Fourth Regiment, who was paymaster, had disposed of our notes and run away to Canada with the proceeds, so that was the last that I ever heard of our wages. I was in the battle of Rhode Island under General Sullivan and in many other scrimmages, one at Moriseny, another near Redden between Valley Forge and Philadelphia, and many others, in which we stood our ground bravely and were not daunted to see a redcoat."

After the war Jo.'ieph Young married an esti- mable young woman, Anna Nickerson, daughter of Moses Nickerson. As he had no property to speak of, her family, who were Tories, ob- jected to the match, but in vain. He succeeded in surmounting all difficulties, and in later years assisted in the support of the Tory family and many of their relations.

Joseph Young displayed the same courage and determination in business that he had shown as a soldier, and rose from fi.sherman to master and owner of vessels. But tlie embargo came, and his vessels lay idle, causing him heavy losses. In the War of 1812 one of his vessels, within twenty-four hours of home, was Captured, and two of his sons, Joseph, Jr., and
