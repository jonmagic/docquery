literature in conden-sed and attractive talks, lifting them above the narrow interests, petty jealousies, and the gossipy hal)it, cannot be told in this brief outline." Of her part in the clubs Miss Sanborn adds: "She is impartial, well poised, never capricious in manner or opinion. She follows the middle path. As hostess, teacher, author, friend, she is always natural, kindly, thinking of others. And so love and appreciation and the truest friendship are given to her by all who are so foi-tunate as to know her and her work."

To this might be added just one thing more â€” that Mrs. Ward has the art of drawing from her friends the heartiest and most loyal service. When a piece of work is to be done to which she cannot give time or attention, she knows on whom to call; and those who know and love her feel it a privilege to do her behest, being assured that when they in turn need help she will more than repay their services, or that they have been more than repaid already. It is in such a woman that the Massachusetts clubs have placed their confid(&gt;nce, in her hands the direction of the Federation at present is held.

Her report to the Massachusetts State Fed- eration of the biennial meeting at Los Angeles in June, 1902, is a model of clearness and brev- ity, and is the best exposition of her spirit under the trying circumstances of the conven- tion. This is its conclusion: "The i)est gift that can be given to any of us is the i)rivilege of being of some use in the world. . . . The re-

ward is in the work itself, even though we may have to wait years for the tangible results. Let us hope that in this co-operation, with the women of the East and the West, the North and the South, working side by side for the same object, unworthy prejudices and antag- onisms may be outgrown and cast aside, so that eventually we shall all stand together for the good of humanity."
