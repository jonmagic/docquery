Mrs. Tibbetts, although deeply interested in public work, is devoted to her home. She enjoys the society of her friends, and a friend- .ship once formed with her is never broken.

From the tower of her house can be .seen the ships in the harbor and many places associated with the history of Boston.

tion was married, on May 25, 1.S65, to William Robert Usher, a shoe manufacturer, of Stone- ham, Mass. While living in Stoneham, Mrs. Usher was active in church and benevolent work, thus endearing herself to the community.

In 1884 Mr. Usher removed to Milton, N.H., starting a shoe factory there. During a resi- dence of several years in Milton, Mrs. Usher was especially interested in religious work. She attended the Baptist church, which had at that time only a few members. The church buikling and its furnishings were unattractive, and the vestry where the prayer meetings were held was "worse than the church," she said. An old stove stood in the middle of the room. The men were seated on old-fashioned wooden seats on one side of the vestry, the women on the other. There was no settled minister, and no cordiality.

Mrs. Usher said: "I camiot stand this. If I am to live in this town, I must have a church home." She cjuietly became acquainted with the people, then started a sewing-circle, and formed other plans for creating a new interest. By suggesting that they open their homes for socials, and formulating methods of work that was much needed, she awakened enthusiasm. In a brief time there were many changes in the management of the church, and thrtuigh her zealous efforts a new church edifice and parson- age were built.

In 1886 Mr. and Mrs. Usher returned to Stone- ham, and soon after settled in Newburyport, where they became leading citizens. Mrs. Usher entered with enthusiasm into the relig- ious, patriotic, anrl charitable work of that city. She was an active member of the Baptist church, was President of the Woman's Auxiliary to the Young Men's Christian Association for six years, and served as Director of the Young Woman's Christian Association of Newbury- port. She attended State conventions as a delegate to societies connected with the Bap- tist denomination, and had an extensive ac- quaintance among its leaders throughout the State. Her hospitable home was always open to welcome clergymen and delegations from other places whenever they visited Newbury- port to conduct special religious work.
