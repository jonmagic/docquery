Fanny Clifford married at the age of seven- teen years the late Philip Henry Brown, of Portland, Me., a manufacturer and banker and a man of much culture. Eight children were born of this union. The father died October 25, 1893. The surviving children are: Philip Greeley Brown: Nathan Clifford Brown, Mrs. Linzee Prescott, Boston: Mrs. F. D. True; of Portland; and Helen Clifford Brown.

Of a strongly religious temperament, Mrs. Brown early became a member of the High Street Congregational Churcli, and was always prominent in its activities. She also felt much interest in charitable work, and took such part in it as her home duties permitted throughout her early married life. It was not, however, until her chiklren had grown to maturity that she became the leader in local philanthropic work which she continued to be to the end of her life. She was also in her later years an enthusiastic club woman, was president of several organizations and a mem- ber of many others. She had a judicial mind, inherited, no doubt, from her father, and, having made a careful study of parliamentary law, was a tactful and popular presiding offi- cer. Some of the clubs and charities of which she was a member are as follows: the \'olun- teer Aid Society, of which she was president,

the society having been fornietl during the Spanish War; the Invalids' Home; the Women's Council; the Crockett Club; the Women's Lit- erary Tnion; the Clifford Club, which was named by the other members in honor of Mrs. Brown's father^ the Portland Fraternity; the Civic Club; the Beecher Club; the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; ami the Young Women's Christian Association. She was president of several of these clubs, and refused this office for many of the others.

She was deeply interested in the Diet Mis- sion. She was vice-president of an organiza- tion recently formed for establishing a mater- nity hospital at Portland. But her favorite charity was undoubtedly the Temporary Home for Women anil Children, of which she was one of the founders in 1882 and always a stead- fast friend. She was the ardent champion of the home throughout a long period during which it was frowned upon by the community as an ill-advised institution â€” a period happily long past. It is not too much to say that most of the present popularity of the home is due to her. She was chosen vice-president of the home in 1885, and retained the office as long as she lived, being for many years, on account of the invalidism of the titular presi- dent, practically president.

Mrs. Brown's death was a pathetic sacrifice and the direct result of her maternal devotion. In December, 1900, she learned by telegraph that her son John (twenty-seven years of age), who had served three years with distinction in the United States army, had left the Phil- ippines and had reached San Francisco, where he lay very ill, in a military hospital, of disease contracted in service. She at once started with a daughter for the Pacific coast. A cold caught on the train developed into pneu- monia. Her nervous system having been sub- jected to a severe strain throughout the jour- ney and her vitality being nmch loweretl by anxiety, her illness soon became alarming, and twelve days after her arrival in San Fran- cisco and after she had seen and comforted her son, himself doomed to a speedy death, she died, December 20, 1900.
