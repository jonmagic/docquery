Mrs. Foster was noted far and near for her good housekeeping. She had had almost, no experience in this department before her lijar- riage, but (as she confided to me a short time before her death) she was tletermined to dis- prove the assertion that- a "strong-minded woman" would, of course, neglect her house and family. As a poor farmer's wife. sfee had a hard task, but she accomplished it- success- fully, though her health was often far from robust. From kitchen to jjlatform was per- haps not an easy transition, yet it was one which she often ma&lt;le with little apparent _diffi- cuity. .. ■ .

The five years of Mrs. Foster's life from 1876 to 1881 were saddened by the illness, of her husband, which was attended with intense suffering and which terminated fatally. But throughout this time of trial and for the suc- ceetling five years preceding her own death, January 14, 1887, her brave and cheerful spirit triumphed over her frail body, and she lived on the serene heights, happy in the conscious- ness of a life well spent and ready for that im- mortal existence which she was convinced would bring her renewed strength and further opportunity to work toward the ultimate good which to her meant God.

A sketch of Mrs. Foster would be incomplete without a word upon the character of her hus- band, which cannot be better said than by his lifelong friend, Parker Pillsbury, in his "Acts of the Anti-.slavery Apostles ":-7-

" Distinguished abolitionists were often called men with one idea. Anti-slavery, in its im- measurable importance to all the interests of the country, material, mental, moral, and social, as well as religious and political, was one idea far too great for ordinary minds, even without any other. But the sturdy synnnetry and con- sistency of Mr. Foster's character were as won- ilerful as were his vigor and power in any one direction. Earliest and bravest among the temperance reformers, when even that cause was almost as odious as anti-slavery became

afterward; a radical advocate of peace from the standpoint of the Sermon on the Mount, 'Resist not evil,' seconded by the apostolic injunction, 'Avenge not yourselves'; a cham- pion in the woman suffrage enterprise from its inception; an intelligent, earnest advocate of the rights of labor and deeply interested in •all the moral, social, and philanthropic associ- ations of the city and neighl)orhood where he lived — he left behind hini a record ami a mem- ory to grow brighter as the years sweep on. . . . The beauty and harmony of his home were- unsurpassed. It was sacred to peace and love. Its unostentatious Ixut elegant antl generous hospitality was the admiration of all who ever enjoyed it."

James Russell Low.ell, in a rh}-nied letter descriptive of the principal figures in the anti- slavery^ bazaar hehl. in; Boston in 1840, pays a charming tribute to Mrs. Foster; —

" A Judith there, tinned Quakeie.ss, Sits Abby in her modest dress, Serving a table quietl}', As if tliat mild and downcast eye Flashed never with its scorn intense, •More than Medea's eloquence.
