result was gratifying. At the thirty-fourth National Encampment of the G. A. R., held in Chicago in 1900, a resolution which was presented by John E. Oilman, Department Commander, was adopted, entlorsing the order and giving to it the same official recognition as that previously accorded to the Sons of \'eterans.

The Soldiers' Home work under the direc- tion of the D. of V. was perpetuated through her efforts, and has met with success. Am- bitious to have the "Daughters" accomplish some work of permanent value in this line, Miss Kimball made the first donation, which resulted in establishing a Soldiers' Home fund. The convalescent ward of the Sokliers' Home is named the D. of V. Ward.

Miss Kimball was elected National President of the Daughters of ^'eterans at the convention in Philadelphia, September, 1899. She or- ganizetl many new tents, and was indefatiga- ble in her efforts to promote the welfare of the order. During her administration the subject of official recognition by the (Jrand Army of the Republic was presented to all the departments of that body in States where tents existed.

"Onward ever, surrender never," has l)een her motto; and with ever ready hcljifulness she has brought the sisters of this grand organi- zation into closer relationship. The daughters have been led to show the same fraternal spirit which actuated the "fathers whose record they proudly revere." The members of the entire order vie with each other in according to Miss Kimball thanks for the good work she has ac- complished.

JULIA ANN BRAY RUSSELL, M.D., was born in Reading, Mass., March 6, 1847, daughter of John and Eliza (Holt) Russell. Her father, a native of Andover, Mass., was a pattern-maker by occupation, and noted for a phenomenal accuracy of eye. In a small way he was also an inventor. He died at the age of fifty-six years. The Doctor's mother, who was born in Reading, Mass., lived to the advanced age of eighty-seven. Her mother (the maternal grandmother) was from the north of Ireland, a devout woman of Protes- tant principles. Both Dr. Russell's father ami

mother were characterized by great gentleness of manner, and to the extent of their resources they devoted themselves to philanthropic work in their inmiei^liate neighborhood, seldom turning a deaf ear to the appeals of the unfortunate, where they could not assist with material aid, tendering a warm and ready sympathy that was often of greater value.

The subject of this sketch acciuired her gen- eral education in the schools of Reading and under the instruction of Rev. Thomas J. Greenwood (Father Greenwood) with whom she studied for four years. One of the recollec- tions of her girlhood is of falling asleep on many nights while the maiden aunt under whom she was reared read to her out of the Bible and Mr. Garrison's anti-slavery paper, the Liberator. The solemn cadences of the Scriptures doubtless neutralized the horrors of the Liberator, and, luUetl by the sweet voice of her aunt, she found the well-deserved rest of the innocent and comi)assionate.
