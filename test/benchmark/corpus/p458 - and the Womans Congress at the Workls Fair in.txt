and the Woman's Congress at the Workl's Fair in 1893.

Mrs. Galpin has given her son a liberal and professional education. She has a beauti- ful home on Spring Hill, with a valuable li- brary, and has won a place in the esteem and respect of the citizens rarely won by man or woman in any community. It was an article from her pen that led to the first meeting of the Heptorean Club of Somerville, of which she was one of the organizers. She became a charter member, has been treasurer since the foundation of the club, has been on the Board of Directors from the first, and has hatl much influence in making this one of the leading women's clubs of the country. Mrs. Galpin was also a charter member of the New Eng- lanil Woman's Press Club, of which she was treasurer for several years.

At the completion of twenty-five years in journalism in one office and under one manage- ment, in the fall of 1903, the citizens of Somer- ville gave Mrs. Galpin a reception and dinner at the Vendome in Boston, as a testimonial of their appreciation of her efforts in all lines of work in the city.

The Mayor, Iildward Glines, presented the greetings of the city, anil other city officials, noted educators, and celebrated women of the State paid tribute to Mrs. Galpin's work and character.

Notwithstanding her busy life, she has been a leailer in many philantliropic and progres- sive civic movements. Few women have impressed themselves upon the community so effectively in so many ways as has she, and in everything she has undertaken she has been eminently successful. While still in the prime of life, she is winning ilistinction as a writer and as a speaker, in society and in philan- thropy, though her energies are largely devoted to the literary and office direction of a pros- perous weekly journal.
