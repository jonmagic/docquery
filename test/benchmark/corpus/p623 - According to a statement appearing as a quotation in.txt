According to a statement appearing as a quotation in a brief genealogy, the Merrills (from whom Miss Soule is tlescended through her mother) are sprung from the Huguenot family of De Merle, who escaped from France to England after St. Bartholomew's day, 1572.

Mrs. Soule's maternal line is given on private authority as follows: John and Nathaniel Mer- rill came from Salisbury, County Wilts, Eng- land, and settletl at Newbury, Mass., early in 1635, being among the first .settlers of that town. Nathaniel married Susannah Wilterton. He die&lt;l in March, 1654-5. His widow married a second husband, named Jordan. AbeP Mer- rill, born in 1644, married Priscilla Chase in 1671. James' Merrill, born January 27, 1689, married about 1715 at Newbury, Ma.ss., Mary Adams, daughter of Sergeant Abraham and Mary Pettingil Adams. She was born January 16, 1692. They moved to Falmouth, Me., about 1738, and he died in 1758. Hum- phrey* Merrill, born January 18, 1718, marrictl Betty Merrill, of North Yarmo\ith, Me., August 29, 1741. He died January 1, 1815. Nathan- iel Merrill, son of Humphrey, married first in 1775 Elizabeth Davis, daughter of Timothy" and Margaret Davis. His .second wife was Judith Brackett-. Nathaniel" Merrill married Hannah True. Mary True Merrill, daughter of Nathaniel Merrill, married Daniel Soule, father of Elizabeth Helena Soule.

Mi.ss Soule received her education at W^est- brook Seminary, a noted Maine school, and

in Boston, where she attended the New Eng- land Conservatory of Music, devoting herself to the study of oratory. After her graduation she studied with Professors Lewis B. Monroe, Robert R. Raymond, Alexander Graham Bell, James E. Murdock, James Steele Mar, and others. She aimed to obtain the best method from each one of these eminent instructors. Meanwhile she served for a few years as prin- cipal of the Franklin Evening School. That position she resigned at length for one that appealed to her more earnestly — namely, the specialty for which she had fitted herself, the teaching and demonstrating of elocution and dramatic art.

She refused many flattering offers to enter the theatrical profession, preferring to work along iiidividual lines. She has been much before the public, however, as a dramatic reader, and for several seasons was at the head of the Soule Dramatic Company, which gave entertainments throughout the New England States and Canada. She has given nmch time and thought to the study of Shakespeare, and has won success as an exponent of Shakespeare's women.

She has several times presented the "Mer- chant of Venice," essaying herself the part of Portia, with her pupils impersonating the other charact':»rs, the production receiving high en- comiums from eminent critics.

Many of her pupils are filling important positions upon the professional stage. Physi- cal culture is always a part of her work as a teacher, and those who have been instructed by her are adepts in the harmony of movement which makes the art that conceals art.

Miss Soule has also accomplished e.xcellent work as an organizer and leader of Shakespear- ian and other literary clubs.
