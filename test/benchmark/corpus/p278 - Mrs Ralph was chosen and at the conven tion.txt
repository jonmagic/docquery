Mrs. Ralph was chosen and, at the conven- tion a year later, was unanimously elected De- partment iSenior \'ice-Presiilent ; in accordance with the custom of the conventions this insures her election as Department President in 1905.

Mrs. Ralph joined the Ladies' Aid As.socia- tion of the Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts soon after it was formed, in 1SS2, serving on the committee that drafted the constitution and also as recording secretary of the association. After holding the office of secretary for three years, she declined a re-election. A valuable silver service, suitably inscribed, was pre- sented her in 1886, accompanied by an en- grossed testimonial expressing the regard of the members and their ajjpreciation of her work. She is now (1904) serving her fifth year as President.

The object of the association is to co-operate with the Board of Trustees in promoting the interests of the Soldiers' Home, assist in fur- nishing a library, and provide, as far as possible, such articles as are necessary for the comfort of tlie inmates. The appointment of finance committees to solicit memberships and the issuing of appeals through the papers and by circulars were the first methods adopted to enlist co-operation and financial support. Women who had rendered service in hospitals and elsewhere during the days of the civil strife, representatives of the old Soldiers' Home or- ganization, members of the Woman's Relief Corps and of other organized charities in Massa-

chusetts, have united their efforts in promoting the work of the Ladies' Aid Association.

Every week since the home was opened, the hearts of the inmates have been cheered by their visits, and by the books, flowers, fruit, and nu- merous other gifts that they have distributed. The entertainments given by the association for the financial benefit of the home have been well patronized. The Ladies' Aid table, with its several annexes, furnished by invitation of the executive connnittee of the Soldiers' Home Carnival in 188.3, netted five thousand four hundred ninety-five dollars and ninety cents to its treasury. The kettledrum arranged for the evening of February 14, 1884, which was attended by five thousand persons, and was recognized by the public anil recorded in the press as a brilliant social event, added four- teen hundred dollars. A part of this sum was expended in the j)urchase of a lot in Forest Dale Cemetery, Maiden.

In referring to the work of the Ladies' Aiil, Mrs. Ralph, in an address given at a church gathering in Sumerville in 1900, said in part : "The association has borne the entire expense of caring for the cemetery lot, which amounted to more than one thousand dollars from 189G to 1899, inclusive. Through the efforts of the late Mrs. E. Florence Barker, condenmed can- non were secured from the War Department and mounted on the lot at a cost of one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The monu- ment of granite was the gift of Mrs. Lyman Tucker, who was an active member from the date of organization until her life's work was completed, ami who remembered the association in her will.
