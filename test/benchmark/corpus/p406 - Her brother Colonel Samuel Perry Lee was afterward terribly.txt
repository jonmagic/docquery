Timid women, foi'getting that they "should be seen and not hearil," came out from their seclusion, went upon the platform, and as by inspiration joined in the rescue of those held in bondage of the intoxicating cup, their hearts (piickened to realize the sorrows of those in des])air. Ruined homes were visited, the wives and mothers bi'ought into the fold of the Woman's Christian Temjicrance I'nion, their children into the Loyal Temi)erance Legion ajid Sunday-schools. Thousands signed the pledge, redeemed for- ever from the curse of alcoholics and narcotics under this wonderful movement, which seemed like a breath of God from heaven moving upon the hearts of the people.
