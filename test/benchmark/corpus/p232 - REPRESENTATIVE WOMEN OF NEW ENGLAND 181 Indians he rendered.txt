Two of these ancestors, nanicly, Hiatt Young, of Chatham (born about 1739), and his son Joseph, fought in the war for American independence, Hiatt Young appearing with the rank of Sergeant on the Revolutionary rolls of the State. For a number of years he was in Captain Webb's, later in Captain Hol- brook's company, Colonel William Shepard's regiment. It is related of him that upon reach- ing his little home after his discharge from the army, without a cent, weary and footsore, having suffered many privations and hard- ships, he left his footprints in blood upon the
