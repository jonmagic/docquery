ued a member of the Museum company, and then Mr. Bartley Campbell, who, unknown to her, had for a week been watching her work on the Museum stage, offered her the position of leading lady in his "Galley Slave" company, to succeed Miss Lillie Glover as Cicely Blaine. It was a company of great strength, including Joseph Wheelock, Marie Prescott, Junius Bru- tus Booth, Frank E. Aiken, Owen Fawcett, and other talented people. At the end of this season Mrs. Kent was especially engaged by Mrs. John Drew for the leading part of Jeanne Guerin to Joseph Wheelock's Jagon. While at Mrs. Drew's theatre she accepted an offer from John Sleeper Clarke, Edwin Booth's brother-in-law, and became leading lady of his company. With him, as leading man, were W. H. V^ernon, the distinguished English actor, and Mrs. Farren. When John T. Raymond produced "Colonel Sellers" in London, he engaged Mrs. Kent for Laura Hawkins, but her husband and father objected to her going, and she was obliged to relinquish also an offer from Mr. Clarke for a London appearance. They were opportunities which would have meant much to a young actress. The follow- ing season she became leading woman with Thomas W. Keene, being featured in the bills, and for two years continued in this arduous position, constantly travelling, and appear- ing in all the principal cities in the United States and Canada in a round of impersona- tions, largely Shakespearean, among them being Ophelia in "Hamlet," Portia in "The Merchant of Venice," Desdemona in "Othello," Queen Elizabeth in "Richard IIL"; Julie de Mor- timer in "Richelieu," Fiordelisa in "The Fool's Revenge." During this engagement she also prepared for appearing as Mariana in "The Wife" and Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet." When Mr. John Stetson's New York Fifth Avenue Theatre Company produced "Divorce," Mrs. Kent was selected for Fanny Davenport's old part of IjOu Ten Kyck. Tlie i)lay had a great cast, with Sarah Jewett as Fanny Ten Eyck (formerly Clara Morris's role), Annie Russell, Herbert Kelcey, and other New York favorites equally distinguished. This was suc- ceeded by "Confusion," simultaneously pro- duced by two of Mr. Stetson's companies.

Mrs. Kent and Mr. Kelcey heading one. Mrs. Kent starred for a season, appearing as Pauline in "The Lady of Lyons," Nancy Sikes in "Oliver Twist," and in other standard plays. Among the hundreds of characters portrayed by her have been Camille, Lady Macbeth, Mari- ana in "The Wife," Galatea in "Pygmalion and Galatea," Lady Lsabel in "East Lynne," Armande in " Led Astray," the title roles in "Leah the Forsaken," "Lucretia Borgia," "Medea," "Evadne," and "Satan in Paris." She was also leading lady and stock star of sev- eral companies producing Paris, London, and New York successes Although exceedingly versatile, her temperament especially fitted her for tragic and emotional roles, and it was in these she won her greatest successes. Mr. Henry Aus- tin Clapp, in passing judgment upon her work, frequently spoke of her "personal distinction and nobility of manner"; her "rare tempera- ment, distinguished beauty, and the depth, range, and expressiveness of her voice." An- other eminent critic said of her work: "Entirely unaffected and natural, it is of commanding character. This young woman possesses mag netism, tremendous underlying power, rare intelligence, and great personal beauty. Few will forget that mobile and sensitive face or that picture of passion, tenderness, and de- spair."
