ETHEL HYDE.â€” The earthly sojourn of Miss Ethel Hyde, comprised within the brief period of twenty-eight years, was a healthy, contentetl, happy life, that reflected the sumiy radiance of a pure soul, and, measured by quality, may be said to have been rounded out anil complete.

Miss Hyde was born in Bath, Me., on the thirtieth day of August, 1871. Her father was General Thomas Worcester Hyde, and her pa- ternal grandparents were Zina and Eleanor (Davis) Hyde. As a leading merchant of Bath in his day, Zina Hyde held an influential posi-

tion in the community. He was a man of scholarly and artistic tastes, and travelled ex- tensively in Europe. Thomas Worcester Hyde was born in Florence, Italy, January 15, 1841 , and was graduated at Bowdoin College in 1861. In the .sununer of that year he raised a companj' of volunteers for the Seventh Maine Regiment. Appointed Major in August, he had the honor, in the ab.sence of the colonel and lieutenant colonel, of leading the regiment to the field. He commanded the Seventh Regiment at An- tietam and ui other engagements. Later he was connni.ssioned Colonel of the First Maine Veteran Volunteers, and at the age of twenty- three years he was commander of the Third Brigade, Second Division, Sixth Army Corps. He was nmstered out in the summer of 1865, after four years of gallant service, and was brevetted Brigadier-general. Later on he re- ceived from Congress a medal of honor. Re- turning to Bath, he jnirchased the Warden Foundrj', which soon, owing to his energy and business ability, developed into the famous Bath Iron Works, of which he was president. He also established the Hyde Windlass Com- pany.

General Hyde endeared himself to all by his manly bearing, business integrity, courteous manner, and cultivated conversation. He was frequently chosen to fill high political offices in both city and State. His classical attainments and literary abilities are evinced in a transla- tion of some of the odes of Horace, published by the Bibliophile Society of Boston, and in an interesting book of reminiscences of the Sixth Corps, entitled "Following the Greek Cross." He died greatly mourned in November, 1899.

His wife, Mrs. Annie Hyde, who survives her husband, was well qualified to be the compan- ion of such a man. Her father, John Hayden, was, to (]Uote a newspaper account of him, " an astronomer, a mathematician, and a profound scholar." He was one of the early abolition- ists, and he, too, held some of the highest politi- cal offices in the city and State. Mrs. Hytle's mother, Mrs. Martha Brown Hayden, was noted for her beauty and wit. Mrs. Hyde herself, finely educated, sympathetic, kindly, of pol- ished manner, keen intelligence, and gracious presence, has maintained her position as chate-
