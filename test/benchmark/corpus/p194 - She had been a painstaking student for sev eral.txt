She had been a painstaking student for sev- eral years when she accepted her first position as a teacher of drawing in the public schools of Dorchester, Mass. When Mr. Walter Smith came to Boston and started the movement for introducing the teaching of drawing in the public and evening schools of the city, there was a rapidly increasing ilemand for well- trained teachers. This resulted in the found- ing of the Normal Art School, in which Miss Bailey has been a popular and esteemed teacher for twenty years, teaching light and shade drawing from animal forms and still life in oil and water-colors.

Among her former ])upils are many of the art instructors at the Pratt Institute, the Cleveland Art School, and other important educational institutions. She was the hrst woman to be elected su])er- visor of drawing in the public schools of Mas- sachusetts. She lias lectured on art in vari- ous cities.

Miss Bailey is a regular attendant of Trinity Church, Boston, and is interested in its several charities. Perhaps her warmest symjiathies are enlisted for sailors, to the homes and hos- pitals for whom many comforts find their way from the hands of the quiet artist in her unostentatious home at the Grundmann Stu- dios. Miss Bailey is a member of the C-opley Society of Boston and of the Industrial Art Teachers' Association. She is an apostle of thoroughness and application, and more than one professor of fine arts to-day remembers with gratitude her efficient training.
