Sewall's History of Woburn states that Thomas Blodgett with his wife and two sons, DanieP and Samuel,^ came in the "Increase" from London in 1635. SamueP Blodgett a number of years later settled in Woburn. Samuel, Jr.,' son of Samuel,^ married Huldah Simontls, and was the father of Sanmel,^ born, say the records, in 1683, and of Daniel,* born in 1685.

Daniel* and SamueP Blodgett removed from Woburn to Stafford, Tolland County, Conn. "Samuel left a son Joshua, born in 1721, reared by his uncle Daniel" (History of Tolland County).

Joshua Blodgett married Hannah Alden, daughter of Daniel* Alden (of Bridgewater, Mass., and Stafford, Conn.) and his wife, Abi- gail Shaw. Daniel* was of the fourth genera-

tion of Alliens in New England, Ijeing desceniled from John' Alden and his wife Priscilla through their son Josejih,^ who married Mary Simmons, and Joseph,^ who married Hannah Dunham and was father of Daniel* (Mitchell's Bridge- water) .

Deacon Alden Blodgett, son of Joshua and Hannah, was born in Stafford in 1766, died in 184S. He was the father of a second Alden, doubtless the Alden Blodgett of Stafford, Conn., above named, Mrs. Walker's grandfather.

The love and talent for nmsic were native to Jennie Patrick. Her doctor uncle, Julius Blodgett, her mother's brother, said of her voice in infancy, "That is music, not merely a baby's cry"; and this remark was verified by the child's singing before she had learned to talk. After graduating from the high school in Warren at the age of sixteen, she came to Bos- ton and became a pupil of Fanny Frazer Foster, taking her first position the following year at the Channing Church in Newton, where she remained for two and a half years. From the first her voice created a furor, and by consci- entious work she made rapid progress. From Newton she went to Worcester to sing in the Church of the Unity, remaining until 1878, when she accepted a position at the Second Church in Boston. After eight years' success- ful work there .she was for fifteen years a mem- ber of the choir of the Arlington Street Church, which for a number of years hafl the reputation of being the best in Boston.

Her great success as a choir singer was ri- valled by that achieved by her in the fields of oratorio and concert, where the rare iiuality of her rich soprano voice created a large de- mand for her services. Mrs. Walker has studied only with teachers in the city of Boston, and is well known and beloved here and in the West and South, where she has often appeared. She has sung in concerts with such celebrities as Lilli Lehmann, Campanini, Dippel, Melba, Noi-dica, Emil Fischer, Gadski, Ben Davies, p]dwaril Lloyd, Watkin Mills, and many other noted singers. She has sung for most of the leading oratorio associations of America and for the Cecilia and Apollo Clubs of Boston, also for the Handel antl Haydn Society, of which for eight seasons she was solo soprano.
