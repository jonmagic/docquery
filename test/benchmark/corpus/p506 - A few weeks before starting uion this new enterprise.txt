A few weeks before starting ui)on this new enterprise Miss Clark had no more idea of found- ing a publishing house than she had of build- ing a railroad. The story of the undertaking is an interesting one, it seemed such a venture- some task on the part of a woman, in a field already so well filled by well-established con- cerns of wide reputation. Men of long expe- rience in the business shook their heads gravely when they heard of tiiis invasion of their hitherto exclusive circle by a woman and with the work of an entirely unknown author. Miss Clark happened to be acquainted with Mr. Charles Felton Pidgin, and partly from friendly motives, partly out of curiosity, went to hear the reading of his manuscript entitleil " Quincy Adams Sawyer." Its fresh country atmosphere, as sweetly natural as the breath of the fields, and its familiar, lovable country characters carried her mind back to the old farm in Unity. Strongly impressed with the uniqueness of the pretty love story and the natural Yankee humor in its characters and scenes, she came away from the reading convinced that it would be well worth while to publish this book.

The great success and wide re|)utation of the two books above named have brought to Miss Clark the manuscripts of authors, known and unknown, from all parts of the country, and her publishing business assumed such proportions that in the fall of 1901 she took an extensive suite of offices in Brown Building, Dewey Square, Boston, whither she transferred her business after disposing of her Back Bay store in the spring of that year.

Greatly increasing business and plans for several new publications necessitated another change in March, 1902, since which time the company has occupied the entire floor at 211 Tremont Street.

In privat(&gt; life Carro Morrell Clark is Mrs. Charles F. Atkinson, of Beacon Street, Boston, her marriage to Mr. Atkinson, a well-known theatre manager, having taken jilace August 24, 1897.

This sketch of Mrs. Atkinson's business life may well be supplemented by a brief record of her ancestry.

Her parents, Dudley Perley Clark and Lucy- Ellen Warren, were married July 11, 1852. They had twelve children. The father (now deceased) was born in Unity, Me., October 26, 1824, the eldest son of Cudworth and Nancy (Perley) Clark. His paternal grandfather, John Clark, was an early settler in that part of the town of Nobleboro, Me., which is now Damariscotta.

In a brief genealogical paper prepared by a student of the family history John Clark is designated as a descendant in the fourth gen- eration of Elisha Clark, who settletl in Kittery, Me., as early as 1690, and from whom the line continued to John^ through Josiah,^ born in 1704, and his son Elisha.^

John Clark, of Nobleboro, married Abigail Bryant. They had a large family of children, one being Cudworth, named above. Nancy Perley, wife of Cudworth Clark, was daughter of John and Mary (Spalding) Perley. Her father, John Perley, was son of Dudley'* Perley (Asa,* Thomas,' ^ Allen') and his wife, Hannah Hale. Mary Spalding was daughter of Benja- min^ S]3alding and a descendant in the sixth generation of Edward' Spalding, an early set- tler of Chelmsford, Mass.
