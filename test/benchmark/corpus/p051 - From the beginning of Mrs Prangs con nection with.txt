From the beginning of Mrs. Prang's con- nection with the Prang Educational Company in 1878, she was adviser on all the educational phases of the work. Even before her name appeared as joint author of the various publi- cations jjrepareil by the company, all ques- tions involving educational influence and value were lirought to her for judgment and advice. Her wide experience antl sympathetic insight as to the needs of the teachers contributed largely toward making possible the wide intro- duction of the Prang work in the public schools of the country. Her wisdom and catholicity helped to make the Prang work acceptable to the utilitarian, to the lover of beauty in form anil color, and to the educator. The spirit of the work in its power of developing and u\)- 1 if ting was never forgotten.

Mrs. Prang was among the first to point out that the instruction in art given in the public schools must of necessity cover entirely dif- ferent ground from that given in the art schools and studios. She taught clearly the difference in the purpose of the twoâ€” the one being in- tended for those specially gifted by nature, while the other means the development of the art instinct, the power of art expression in every child. Advocating these views, she is a frequent speaker at art and educational associations. The difficulties attending the introduction of a comi)aratively new work and the lack of public school training on the part of supervisors led them to seek frequent con- ferences with Mrs. Prang, and many super-

visors submitted to her criticism oullincs for work in their scliools before giving tlie work to teachers and pupils. Tlie need of closer and more systematic instruction for teachers and supervisors becoming apjiarent, the Prang normal art classes for home study in form, drawing, and color, with instruction by corre- spondence, were organized in 1SS7. They were designed to assist pulilic school teachers in preparing thcnnselves to toivch the subjects of form, drawing, and color. The advantages of these classes were cfuickly seized upon by hundreds of teachers in all grades, by jirinci- pals of schools, and by supervisors.

Much of the beneficent and far-reaching influence of this movement is unquestionably due to the personality of Mrs. Prang as director. Her beautiful spirit made itself distinctly felt even through the cold medimn of dictated letters and typewritten correspondence. Her cheerful greeting to the new student, perhai)s in Maine, perhaps in C'alifornia, established from the first a sense of welcome and an as- surance of sympathy.

This instruction by correspondence came like a ray of light in the darkness to many a discouraged, conscientious teacher, struggling in her own out-of-the-way little corner with the great problems of education.' For to Mrs. Prang, and to those who shared her faith and her enthusiasm, art education in the public schools meant the uplifting of all the studies to a higher plane. In all her teachings the thought was to lead beyond the actual thing taught to its relation to nature and to human life. Those who were fortunate enough to become students with Mrs. Prang will look back upon the association with a deep sense of pleasure and gratitude.
