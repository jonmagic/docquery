REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

313

During her recent stay in America Mrs. Bates-Batcheller has placed herself under the care of Georg Henschel, B. J. Lang, and Girau- det (of the Paris Opera), whose unciualificd approval she has been fortunate enough to gain. The artistic frientlship most highly prized by Mrs. Bates-Batcheller is that of Madame Maicella Senibrich, who in every way with help and advice, on hearing her sing, has given the greatest praise and encouragement. Thus in course of years the wai-mest attachment has grown between them. Already in America Mrs. Bates-Batcheller's voice has attracted general attention, owing to her generosity in singing for charitable entertainments. Her debut in New York City was made at one of the morning concerts in tlie grand ball-room of the Waldorf Astoria, where she achieved the greatest success. This was cjuickly followed by an aj^pearance at a concert given for charity by Countess Leary and Mrs. Astor. In writ- ing of one experience, when she .sang to the little blind children of the Perkins Institute in Boston, Mrs. Bates-Batcheller said: "No audience has ever given me such applau.se, and I was never more anxious to please than when I sang to those poor dear little children. Their hands and feet kept time to the gay songs, and they hung their heads in sorrow and sym- pathy with the sad ones." After hearing her remarkable voice at the New England Woman's Club, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe dubbed the young artist "her nightingale," and afterward gave a delightful musicale in her honor. An added joy was given to this occasion by the presence of her college president, Mrs. Louis Agassiz, who remarked that she was most proud of her Radcliffe song-bird.

Among the many accomplishments of Mrs. Bates-Batcheller are to be reckoned an ac- quaintance with French, German, and Italian literatures and a fluent use of those languages. This desirable result was undoubtedly contrib- uted to by her extended classical studies in Latin and Greek at Radcliffe College. Recently the singer has found leisure to write some excellent lyric poetry that has received the warm commendation of her friend, Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton; and it is more than probable that these poetic flowers will

shortly see the light of publication. As Mrs. Bates-Batcheller is still a very young woman, her career may be said to be all before her.

During a recent vi.sit in Washington, Mrs. Bates-Batcheller, by invitation of Mrs. Roose- velt, sang at the White House. To meet the young artist, a most distinguisheil company, including Senator and Mrs. Cabot Lodge, Sena- tor Hoar, Secretary Root, Vice-President Frye, were invitetl. Both the President and Mrs. Roo.sevelt were delightetl with the voice of Mrs. Bate.s-Batcheller, who looks back on such a memorable occasion with the greatest pleasure. AMiile she has already succeeded in winning the highest praise from the best French critics in Paris, she has overcome at her Boston pro- fessional debut a still greater difficulty — per- haps the greatest an American-born artisf ever has to face — the gaining recognition of high artistic standing in her own city. That this fortunate result has been achieved beyond any question there is not the slightest doubt, for, as the foremost nmsical publication in the world expresses it, "the general conisensus of critical opinion expressed at her brilliant debut has placed her at one bound among the first artists of the day."
