Mrs. Bailey has travelled extensively in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States. In helping to advance other reforms, also, Mrs. Bailey has been active. Together with two or three other prominent ladies of her State, she has been trying for years to olUain a reformatory prison for women in Maine. The outlook toward good results of their untir- ing efforts now seems encouraging.

Mrs. Bailey became president of the Maine Equal Suffrage Association in 1891, and held the position for six years. She was one of the judges in the Department of Liberal Arts at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, having been appointed by the Board of Lady Managers. At Washington in. 1895 she was elected treasurer of the National Council of Women for three years. Similar positions she has held for many years at a time in the work of her church. Three times she has received appointment from the governor of her State to represent Maine on the National Board of Charities and Correction.

For many years Mrs. Bailey has been in the habit of aiding, both financially and by letters of encouragement and counsel, young people of limited means who have shown themselves desirous of obtaining a good education in order to take part in the work and reforms of the world. As her proteges pay her back the money loaned them, she passes it on to other ambitious young persons of her acquaintance, and thus the beautiful work continues.

At her home, "Sunnyslope," Mrs. Bailey practises the doctrine which she advocates so enthusiastically — the "brotherhood of all man- kind under the white banner of peace" — and welcomes guests from every land. Mrs. Bailey

puts her horses, carriages, and boats at the command of her visitors, while each morning usually finds her for several hours at her tlesk, with her faithful secretary sitting neiir, receiv- ing and sending out letters and other manu- scripts to promote the interests of the cause she loves.

Mrs. Bailey's home is delightfully situated in a town containing five large lakes and fine mountain scenery. The church of her choice stands on a slight eminence on the south. On her beautiful grounds gravel walks are laid out among choice flowers and plants, with a fountain throwing up sparkling spray. A greenhouse joined to the dwelling supplies flowers all the year around for the pulpit of the church and for the comfort and cheer of "shut-in" friends and neighbors.

Mrs. Bailey's friends often remonstrate with her against the strenuous life she lives, fearing that her strength may not be (&gt;qual to so much effort, but she smiles as she replies, "I must be among those who wear out, not those who rust out.' There are few, if any, of the philan- thropists of the world who more enjoy their work than does the subject of this sketch. Truly does she live " not to be ministered unto, but to minister"

"For the cause that needs assistance. For the wrongs that need resistance, For the future in the distance, And the fiood that she cm dc."
