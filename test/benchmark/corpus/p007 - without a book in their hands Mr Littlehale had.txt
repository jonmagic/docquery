without a book in their hands." Mr. Littlehale had a good knowledge of history, especially American.

The period of time now arrived at, the vivi- fying dawn of New England Transcendentalism, brought golden opportunities to the young as- pirant for intellectual culture. A great awak- ening and a new sense of the surpassing riches of life was the result to Ednah D. Littlehale of attending for three successive seasons the con- versations of Margaret Fuller. Few teachers have shown to such a degree the power of per- sonality.

Mrs. Cheney writes: "I absorbed her life and her thoughts, and to this day I am astonished to find how large a part of what I am when I am most myself I have derived from her. . . . She did not make us her disciples, her blind followers. She opened the book of life and helped us to read it for ourselves."

Of Mr. Emer-son, Mrs. Cheney says, " I never missed an opportunity of hearing him or read- ing his works"; and of Mr. Alcott, not all of whose theories she couUl accept, "But he gave me an insight into the life and thoughts of the old philosophers, anil moreover gave me the constant sense of the spiritual, the supersen- sual life that is the most precious of all posses- sions."

It is significant that Mrs. Cheney and her elder sister, Mary F., were among the first parishioners of Theodore Parker when he came from West Roxbury to Boston, 1846. Inspirer, friend, and comforter in time of sorrow he ever remained.

For a year or two before her marriage Mrs. Cheney was the secretary of the School of De- sign for Women in Boston, of which she was one of the founders. Short-lived, the school yet served to show the existence of talent among American women, and is remembered as "one of the failures that enriched the ground for success."

As an artist's wife she maile her first visit to Europe, sailing with her husband for Liverpool in August, 1854. The year following their return (in June, 1855)

He was one of the earliest crayon artists in America. Mrs. Howe thus speaks of him: "Seth Cheney's crayon portraits were among the delights of his time. The foremost women of Boston were glad to sit to him, and his rendering of their features has now for us

"' The tender p;rare of a day that is dead.'

Among his portraits of men, I especially re- member one of Theodore Parker which was highly prized. An exhibition of a number of these works was arranged some years since by Mr. S. R. Koehler, curator of engravings, Art Museum, at the Boston Art Museum. It was an occasion of much interest, recalling many lovely and distinguished personalities, inter- preted by Mr. Cheney with a grace and simplicity all his own."
