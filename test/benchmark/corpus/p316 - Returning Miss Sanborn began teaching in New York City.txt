Returning, Miss Sanborn began teaching in New York City, and also lecturing, first in Mrs. Stokes's parlor, till, outgrowing it, she moved to rooms of the Young Women's Christian Asso- ciation, and finally to those in Dr. Howard Crosby's church, speaking to audiences that crowded them. This work was reported weekly in the Tribune, World, Sun, ami Times.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

For several years she reviewed books for the Club Room Department in The Galaxy. Dr. J. G. Holland gave her the Bric-a-brac Depart- ment in Scribner's, and at this time she met every week a class of married women at Mrs. Holland's, condensing and discussing new books. Meanwhile she was an individual and potent factor in New York social and literary life. At Mi-s. John Sherwood's — or in any place where wit and wisdom gathered — she was at home, unpretending, picturesque, humorous.

She has written over forty lectures, and read them in many places in New York and the West and all over New England. Calendars are her recreation: they run right off her pen, or are collected from other penmen. "&lt;)ur Calendar" gives to each date a few lines from an American author. Then we have "Cupid's," "ChiKIren's," "Sunshine," "Rainbow," "Star- light," "Indian Summer" calendars; and, just so long as Kate Sanborn e.xists in the flesh, they will keep coming. Certainly that is our hope.

Club work is outside her kingdom, but she was the first president of New Hampshire's Daughters, an as.sociation of women born in New Hampshire, but living in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Hers was a notable administration, and brought to the organiza- tion a prestige which remains. Rules might fail, but the brilliant president never. She governed a merry company, many of them famous, but she was chief. They loved her, and that affection and pride still exist.

She is with her sister, Mrs. Paul Babcock, at Montclair, N.J., or in New York, some part of each winter; but her home is at Breezy Meadows, Metcalf, Mass., where several years since she "adopted" an abandoned farm, which later .she deserted for a farm only a short distance beyond it, on the opposite side of the road, where she .settlerl down to agriculture, hospitality, and authorship. In each of these industries she excels, iiKJst of all in pen work.

Life is beautiful to Kate Sanborn, the homes of friends delightful; but Breezy Meadows, with its cattle, horses, and dogs, its bu.sy out- door life, its growing crops and old-fashioned flowers and hen-coops, its century-old fireplace anil friends beside it, is ever the land of her

heart's desire. Her thoughts are transfixed on the point of a sharp and fearless pen.

Miss Said)orn has published " Home Pict- ures of English Poets" (commendations called out by this one volume would make a book. College men and students of literature point to it as a fascinating study of facts, holding a permanent ])lace of its own) ; " Wit of Women" ("Its play [of wit] is like that of summer light- ning on the clouds, so quick, varied, and irra- diant," writes Frances Willard); "Adopting an Abandoned Farm"; "Abandoning an Adopted Farm"; "A Truthful Woman in Southern California"; "'My Literary Zoo"; "Favorite Lectures"; "Vanity and Insanity Shadows of Genius." Not a dull volume or lectui'e from this rarely gifted writer, and every book does one good. If sentences are pictu- res(|ue, witty, they are also lessons in excellent English. How well this woman Avas equipped for her work, how healthy and sunny, strong and laughable, instructive and amusing, is the product of her mind! And she is still busy, preparing two new books, writing regular book chats for one paper and reviews for the Natiojial Magazine.
