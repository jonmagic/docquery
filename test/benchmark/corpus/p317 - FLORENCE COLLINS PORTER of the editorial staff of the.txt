Mrs. Collins h;i.s livcnl to sec ker live children occupy positions of influence and honor. She has recently gone to make her home with her daughter Florence, Mrs. Porter, in South Pasadena. At seventy-six years of age she is in possession of active mental faculties, with the prosjject of continued long life in the land of sunshine.

Mi's. Porter was graduated from the public schools of Caribou, and has always taken an interest in educational matters. Elected as a member of the School Committee of Cariboii in 1882, she served in that capacity one year, being one of the first women in the State of Maine to hold such a position. After the death of her husband, the Re^â– .

From 1896 to 1898 Mrs. Porter was vice- president of the Maine Federation of Women's Clubs and from 1898 to 1900 the president. When she went to Los Angeles, the Federation showed its appreciation of her services by cre- ating the office of honorary president, and giving her that title. In Los Angeles she is a member of the Friday Morning Cluli and of the Ebell, and an honorary member of the Ruskin Art Club. At tlip time of the biennial meeting of 1902 she edited an illustrated souve- nir edition of the Los Angeles Herald that at-
