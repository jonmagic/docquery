The daughter of Na- thaniel Ruggles Whitney, Jr., and his wife, vSarah Stone, she was born on September 2, 1821, the youngest of a family of seven chil- dren. Her father was a lineal descendant in the seventh generation of John Whitney, a native of Westminster, England, who set- tled in Watertown in 1635.

As revealed by genealogical research, John Whitney was the third son of Thomas and Mary (Bray) Whitney, and was baptized July 26, 1592. Thomas Whitney, his father, was buried in St. Margaret's, Westminster, April 14, 1637. He was a son of Robert Whitney and grand- son of Sir Robert Whitney, member of Parlia- ment in 1559.

of Whitney families in England for fourteen generations, tracing; the line of John of Water- town and his father, Thomas of Westminster, England, back to a Sir Robert de Witteneye, living in 1242, who is spoken of by Mr. Mel- ville as the "first historic \Vhitney."

From John Whitney, the English immigrant, and his wife Elinor, to Anne, the American sculptor, the line was continued through John, Jr.,^ Benjamin,' Daniel,^ Simon,^ Nathaniel Ruggles," and Nathaniel Ruggles, Jr.,' the father above named.

Nathaniel Ruggles Whitney, born in 1759, served as Town Clerk of Watertown, Justice of the Peace, anil schoolmaster. His wife, Abigail Frothingham, born in 1760, was a daughter of JamesÂ° and Abigail (Bradish) Frothingham, of Charlestown, and aunt to the artist, James Frothingham, third of the name, born in 1788, who ranked seventy years ago as "one of our best portrait painters," being thus mentioned by Dunlap in 1834.

Nathaniel R. Whitney, Jr., born in 1782, married in 1806 Sally (or Surah) Stone, who was born in 1784. Her father, Jonathan Stone, of Watertown, Miss Whitney's paternal grand- father, was a descendant in the fifth genera- tion of Deacon Simon Stone, who came from England with his wife Joan and four children in the ship "Increa.se" in the spring of 1635, and, settling at Watertown, became the founder of a prominent branch of the Stone family in New England. The record of the baptism of Deacon Simon Stone, of Watertown, has been found in the parish register of Much Brom- ley, now Great Bromley, Essex County, Eng- land, thus: "1585-6, 9 Feb., Simond, son of Davie Stone &amp; Ursly his wife."
