Mr. Gilman was a member of the Executive Committee of Arrangements and of other committees for the National Encampment of 1904. He takes great interest in all the efforts of his wife in the work of women's organiza- tions, and they have travelled extensively together in all parts of the State and to na- tional gatherings in representing the work of the Grand Army and Woman's Relief Corps.

As an eloquent speaker his services are in great demand, and he has often adtlressed pub- lic and social gatherings of the Woman's Relief Corps, to which organization he is sincerely de- voted.

At the thirty-eighth National Encampment of the G. A. R., held in Boston, August 15-20, 1904, he was appointed Adjutant-general by the newly elected Commander-in-chief, General Wilmon W. Blackmar.

Mrs. Gilman united with Thomas G. Ste- venson Corps, No. 63, of Roxbury, in 1886. As Special Aide to Mrs. Eva T. Cook, of Glouces- ter, Department President, she performed important duties at the National Convention in Louisville, Ky., having charge of the Ma.ssa- chusetts headquarters at the Gait House. She held successively the offices of Depart- ment Inspector, chairman of the Executive Board, Department Junior Vice-President, and Senior Vice-President, and in 1900 was unani- mously elected Department President.

Throughout the year her official work was conducted in an earnest, dignified, and gracious manner, manifesting her imselfish devotion to the cause. She was the recipient of many courtesies from G. A. R. posts, and she retired from the presidency with the respect of all officers an(l her associates.

During her term the relief expenditures in Massachusetts amounted to nearly twenty thousantl dollars, and over a thou.sand dol- lars atkiitional were expended for Memorial Day work in the South, Antlersonville Prison property, aid for veterans who suffered in the Galveston (Tex.) disaster, and in other relief outside the regular work in this State.

In her annual address, presented to the Twenty-second Annual Convention, heUl in Boston in February, 1901, she said: "Through- out the year I have constantly borne in mind the honor and the responsibility confided in me, and it has been ever my aim so to perform the duties of my office as to deserve your approbation. You will be gratified to know that by reason of greatest membership and most generous dispensation of relief the dawn of the twentieth century finds us still occupy- ing that proud and enviable position, the banner department of the Woman's Relief Corps."

As a warm friend to the army nurses, she referred to their society in Massachusetts as follows: "This worthy and unique association appeals with peculiar force to the sympathy and friendship of the members of our order. ... 1 charge you to let no army nurse lack the comforts of life while a dollar remains in the treasuries of the corps of this department."
