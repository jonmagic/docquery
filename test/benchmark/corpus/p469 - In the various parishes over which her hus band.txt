Mr. and Mrs. Hayward were graduated from the Chautauqua Lit(&gt;rary and Scientific Cir- cle of South Franiinffliani in ISSS. She was president of the Woman's Christian Temper- ance Union and a leader in the campaign against the Tujuor saloons in Framingliam, meeting with great success. Having i)een selected by a special conuuittee to write a history of the town of Hancock, N.H., Mr. Hayward for seven years devotetl all the time he could spare from parish and other public duties to this work. The book was published in 18S9, and contains over a thou.sand printed i)ages of valuable material. It is recognized by histoi'ical and genealogical societies and by the officials of public libraries as one of the best town histories ever issued.

In its jireparation Mrs. Hayward rendered valuable assistance. Diligently searching four volumes of town and one of church records, she compiled the list of marriages, nearly a thousand in number.

In June, 1SS9, Mr. Hayward accepted a call to the First Congregational (Unitarian) Church in Medfield, Mass. He won the love and respect of the citizens of the town, as in former places where he had been settletl as pastor. Popular with the young and ever thoughtful of their interests, he was active in the guild movement (since his death named the Hayward Guild) and in temperance and charitable work. The Norfolk Unitarian Club was organized by him ; and the various branches of work, in all of which he was assisted by his wife, prospered under his charge. His ad- dress on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of the church, October S, ISSO, was published in pamphlet form. Mr. Hay- ward was a friend of the Woman's Relief Corps, and in 1891 he accompanied Mrs. Hayward, who was a delegate, to the National Conven- tion held in Detroit, Mich.

As an officer of the National Army Chaplains' Association, which he helped to form in De- troit in 1891, as a Memorial Day orator and a leading spirit in many philanthropic move- ments, he was widely known; and his death, which occurred in Medfield, July 26, 1892,

caused soriow in many sections of the country. The conmiittee of the church in Medfield paid the following tribute to his memory: "We look back upon the years of his pastorate as years of pros]jerity in the history of this church and parish and as years marked by dee|) in- tei'cst in all that pertains to the building up of true, noble Christian character and stinui- lating its people to useful Christian lives. We respected him for his true manliness, dignity, and unselfishness." The Young People's Re- ligious Guild remembered with gratitude the interest manifested liy him in their organiza- tion.
