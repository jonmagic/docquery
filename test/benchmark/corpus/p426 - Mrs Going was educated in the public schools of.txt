Mrs. Going was educated in the public schools of her native town and at Lawrence Academy, Groton, and soon after her graduation she be- came a teacher. Inheriting from her pai-ents an intense love of music, she began its study when she was only ten years old, and before reaching her twelfth birthday was organist in the Unitarian church, which had the first pipe organ in the town. She sub.sequently devoted much time to nmsical studies, and in 1890 or- ganized and equipped an orchestra, of which she became the managing dii-ector. The mar- riage of Maria Wilder Taylor and Myron Fran-

cis Going took place on the 25th of December, 1867. Mr. Going is a native of Townsend, Mass. On October 18, 1861, he enlisted for three years in the Twenty-sixth Massachusetts Regiment of Volunteers. At the expiration of this term of service he was honorably discharged. He re-enlisted as a private, and was promoted to Commissary Sergeant. For several years he has been a member of Abraham Lincoln Post, No. 11, G. A. R., of Charlestown. This post's auxiliary, Abraham Lincoln Relief Corps, No. 39, Mrs. Going joined m 1888. After filling several minor offices in the corps, she was elected president, and performed her duties in such a creditable manner that higher honors in the oi-der were bestowed upon her. As De- partment Aide, Assistant Inspector, and In- stalling Officer, she attended many corps meet- ings in different parts of the State. In 1898 she was elected a member of the Department Executive Board; in 1899 Department Junior Vice-President. The following year she became Senior Vice-President, and at the annual con- vention in 1901 was unanimously elected De- partment President.

During her term of office Mrs. Going trav- elled several thousand miles, participating in various patriotic assemblies. A summary of her year's work was given in her address to the Department Convention held in the Park Street Church, Boston, in February, 1902.

Referring to Memorial Day, she said; "The interestmg report of the Department Chaplain will show that this sacred day was appropri- ately and universally observed throughout the State. Our corps, moved by a common im- pulse, united with their respective posts, in paying homage to our fallen heroes. As year by year rolls by, Memorial Day brings to each of us a deeper and more lasting significance, not only to the survivors of the Civil War, but to every loyal citizen of this nation. With sadness we recount each passing year a diminu- tion in the rank and file of the Grand Army of the Republic. . . . While we speak of the brave and dauntless soldier, let us not forget the gal- lant sailors who lie so silently sleeping in the depths of the sea, whose rolling, restless billows chant their only requiem."

In regard to the strewing of flowers on the

Carr, adopted by the Nineteenth National Convention, and earn- estly hope that this beautiful ceremony will be incorporated, as far as possible, in the memorial services of every corps in this department."
