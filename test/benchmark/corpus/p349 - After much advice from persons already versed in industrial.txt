Weber to introihicc it, and the Women's Resi- dence of the South Knd to house it, the first ■lace industry in this country was hegun I&lt;&gt;1)- ruary 18, 1901, with one pupil. Miss ICli/.ahetli Feely. Her progress was watched with inter- est, and in the first week was begun a simple, narrow insertion of English thread lace, that was salable at sixty cents a yard. Other girls came, but either they were not adapted or cir- cimistances took them away. In six weeks, however, another lace-maker had conie to stay, Miss Alice Riorden; and the.se two girls for many months carried on ''the induahy." Their progess was encouraging. They began at once with the very fine thread, and learned first tf) make the beautiful lace known as the P^nglish thread. Then they were taught to make sep- arate figures and to ornament them with deli- cate fillings peculiar to old Honiton. Small things were turned out — at first, tie ends, doilies, little collars. Then orders came for more pretentious articles. The girls learned to clean laces in the I'AU'opean manner. Rare things came to Mrs. Weber to be restored, from Portsmouth, N.H., Fitchhurg, from St. T&gt;ouis even. New girls joined the industry, and it began to pay its own way. Since the first six months of its existence there has not been a day when there were not orders ahead to be filled. At present six lace-makers are busy all the time, and several outside the shops lU'e filling orders for special varieties that can be made at home.

So nuich has been accomplished by one New England woman in the face of great difficulties. American girls, absolutely untrained, have in one year been taught to make the finest laces, equal, it is claimed, to any produced in the world at the present day by workers whose families have been lace-makers for generations.

HELEN COFFIN BEEDY was born in Harrington, Washington County, Me., November 9, 1840, the daugh- ter of John B. and Ruby fStrout) Coffin. Her maternal grandparents, Benja- min and Joanna (Roberts) Strout, were pioneer settlers of Harrington. Benjamin Strout was a man greatly respected for his

sterling integrity. He traced his descent from a long line of English ancestors. His wife Joanna, a native of Portland, Me., was a famous housekeeper. Her receipts and her instructions, her chiklren say, have never been improved upon by the inventions of modern domestic science. She was also nuich given to works of charity.

Mrs. Beedy's father, John B. Coffin, by occupation a ship-builder, was one of the leading citiz(&gt;ns of Harrington in his day. He u.sed to .solemnize marriage, and he often representetl the town in the State Legis- lature. In politics he was a Democrat. Both Mr. and Mrs. Coffin were members of the Baptist church. Many of his ancestors and their kindred were Quakers or Friends, and Mrs. Beedy is proud to be allied to Lucretia Mott and the Rev. Phciebe Hanaford. The Coffin lineage in America extends back to Tris- tram Coffin, who came to New England in 1642, and diwl in Nantucket in 1681.
