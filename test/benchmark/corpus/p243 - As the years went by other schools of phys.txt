As the years went by, other schools of phys- ical training were^ established, bicycle-riding and athletics became the fashion for women as well as men, and many other causes con- spired to render the classes somewhat smaller than heretofore, although the enthusiasm of those who came was undiminished. Accord-

ingly it was finally decidetl to transfer the gymnasium to the beautifully eejuipped smaller hall over the Turkish baths, where the work has been successfully carrietl on for the past four years, and still continues with unabated interest.

It is not simply as an admirable teacher of gymnastics that Miss Allen is entitled to the gratitude of the comnmnity. In her carefully worked- out system of physical training, where brain and nuiscles play an equal part, she has made a lasting contribution to educational science. A pioneer, and for a time almost the ordy woman engaged in this line of work, she entered the field just at the time when it was beginning to be felt that order might be brought out of the chaos which had hitherto prevailed in the gymnasium. Prior to this period the comparatively few gymnasiums that existed had been largely usetl liy professionals and those who devoted themselves to the exag- gerated development of certain sets of muscles, in order to accomplish feats of strength, agil- ity, or endurance. No all-around develop- ment had yet been attempted. She now threw herself with ardor into the task of organizing some scheme of symmetrical training, and later, as the way opened before her, she ear- nestly strove to lift gymnastics into the domain of education.

At that time the only plea for gymnastics was in the interest of health. While fully con- vinced of the importance of this aim. Miss Allen felt that there was another side of the subject to be brought out, in which the field of investigation was as yet untrotlden. She developed a scheme of progressive gymnastics which would gradvially bring every part of the body under the control of the will. The discovery made a few years later, in the realm of physiological research, of the "motor tracts" in the brain — i.e., definite nerve centres initi- ating and controlling motion in every part of the body — gave the physical trainer a place in the educational field. This cleared the way not only for her, but for others whowere work- ing along similar lines of thought.

The educational value of her work lies in the progressive nature of her scheme of train- ing, in which she has sought to develop the

natural sequence of brain action in co-ordi- nated movements. Such education not only results in ph_ysical development, but in the acquisition of courage, alertness, self-possession, nervous control in many ways, general con- centration of thought, and other expansion of the higher nature. "If," to use her own words, "the aim of education is to stimulate thought, and its end to equip one for living, then harmonious brain development is essen- tial. It is now universally conceded that the cultivated brain is not the largest nor the heav- iest, but the one in which the most brain cells are vital, and where the connections between cells are must numerous and intimate: these are the conditions upon which mental vigor depends. No part of the physical brain, there- fore, should be deprived of its fair share in development, and our educators must sooner or later recognize the fatal mistake, found in all our school and college curriculums, of ex- cluding to so great a degree the education of those nerve centres whose ])rimary expression is in motion, but whose vitality reacts in many directions."
