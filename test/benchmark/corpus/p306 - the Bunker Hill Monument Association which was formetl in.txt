Mr. and Mrs. Davis removed in September, 1853, to Palmer, Mass., where Mr. Davis pur- cha-sed a dry-goods store, and was a successful merchant. They had two children: George Lawrence, l)orn March 26, 1854, who died Nov. 29, 1883: and Annie Elizabeth, who is still living. Mrs. Davis became interested in church and charitable work in Palmer, devoting her special efforts to the cause represented by L. L. Merrick Post, G. A. R., and its aux- iliary Relief Corps, which was formed in 1886. She was elected first President of the Relief Corps, and was installed into this office five years in succession.
