STELLA EDWARDS FIERPONT DRAKE, now in the ranks of success- ful New England business women, was born in Sturgis, Mich., December 1, 1855.

The next four ancestors in this line, successively named Abraham, were among the wealthy men

of Hampton, N.H., and very active in the affairs of that town and vicinity, where the original Drake farms and homestead may still be seen.

Among the rei)resentatives of the family in later days in this vicinity were Samuel Gardner Drake, the anti(|uary, an early jiresi- dent of the New England Historical and Gen- ealogical Society, and his son, Samuel Adams Drake, the well-known author.
