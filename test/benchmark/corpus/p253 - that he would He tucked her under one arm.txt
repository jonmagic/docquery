that he would. He tucked her under one arm, and, holding his club with the other, marched her out through the crowd, who were roughly handling Mr. Foster and such of the other speakers as they had been able to catch. Her representations finally so prevailed upon him that he mounted her on a stump, and stood by her with his club while she addressed the mob. They were so moved by her speech that they not only desisted from further violence, but took up a collection of twenty dollars to pay Stephen Foster for his coat, which they hail torn in two from top to bottom.

When she began to lecture, she would not charge an admission fee, partly because she was anxious that as many people as possible should hear and be converted, and she feared that an admission fee might keep some away, and partly from something of the Quaker feeling that it was wrong to take pay for preaching the gospel. She economized in every way. When she stayed in Boston, she used to put up at a lodging-house on H:inover Street, where they gave her meals for twelve and a half cents and lodging for six and a quarter cents, on condi- tion of her sleeping in the garret with the daugh- ters of the house, three in a bed.

Once, when she was in great need of a new cloak, she came to Salem, Mass., where she was? to lecture, and found that the Hutchinson family of singers were to give a concert the same evening. They proposed to her to unite the entertainments and divide the proceeds. She consented, and bought a cloak with the money. She was also badly in want of other clothing. Her frienils assured her that the autliences would be just as large despite an admission fee. She tried it, and, finding that the audiences continued to be as large as the halls would hold, she continued to charge a door fee, and was no longer reduced to such straits.

She had three lectures, on "The Social and Industrial Disabilities of Women," "The Legal and Political Disabilities of Women," and "The Religious Disabilities of Women." In the early fifties she gave these three lectures at Louisville, Ky., to innnen.se auiliences, thereby clearing six hundred dollars, and was in- vited to stay and give another on temperance.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

From these four lectures in St. Louis she cleared seven hundred tlollars.

She headed the call for the first National Woman's Rights Convention, held in A\'orces- ter, Mass., October 23 and 24, 1850, and took a leading part in getting uj) tlie meeting. The report of this convention in the New York Tribune converted Susan B. Anthony to woman suffrage, and led John Stuart Mill's wife to write for the Westminster Rcrieir an article which was the starting-point of the equai rights movement in England. This convention was also the first that called wide public attention to the question in this coimtry, although the attention was mostly in the way of ridicule. Year after year Lucy took the laboring oar in getting up conventions and in printing and selling the woman's lights tracts at the meet- ings. She was "such a good little auctioneer," said one who remembei'ed her well.
