Miss Newell has made many ocean voyages with her father and mother, having been around Cape Horn four times. Her travels have been extensive, and she has usetl her opportunities

for the benefit of others. Her life to the pres- ent has been a strenuous one, with many tragic and strange jjcriods: but the privations and trials have given her place among women who have striven to overcome difficulties, and have made them stepping-stones to a broad and noble life.

MARY ALDERSON ATHERTON was l)orn in Pennsylvania, near the vil- lage of LeRaysville. Her parents, John and Margaret Alderson, were English ])eople whose chief wealth consisted of their eleven children, eight boys and three girls. In 1881 Miss Alderson married Willard M. Chandler, of Boston, a leader in liberal thougiit, who died in 1889. In 1903 Mrs. Chandler liecame the wife of Frederick Ather- ton, a well-known attorney of Boston.

Her education began in the typical coim- try school, o]ien three months in winter and three in summer. It was continued at the vil- lage academy one term and at the Orwell Hill graded school three terms, a teacher's certificate then being granted her at the age of fifteen. At sixteen, or as early as the law of the Key- stone State permitted, she began teaching in a small country school in what was locally known as the "Cleveland District."

Having entered upon the work to which she was by nature inclined, she determined to gain in it the front rank. This necessi- tated a broader education and special training, and from what source the requisite funds were to come was an unsolved and seemingly hope- less -{jroblem. But at this critical juncture Fate took her by the hand, and, as if, in its earnest aspirations, one soul had bounded over the intervening mountains and wildernesses and struck a responsive chord in the heart of another, a letter came from a good elder Brother, who many years before had gone prospecting in the rough country that lay toward the setting sun. The letter said in ])art : "The little sister whom I left behind me years ago must be a young lady by this time, and I want her to be given an education. Send her away to school. Here is two hundred dollars as a starter, and if I make a big stake, as I have a good show to

do, will send more when needed." This un- expected opportunity was eagerly seized, and Miss Alderson, entering the State Normal School at Mansfield, Pa., was graduated with the honors of her class two years later.

The first three years of her i)ublic life were spent in teaching in Venango City (since merged into Oil City) and Franklin, in the heart of the Pennsylvania oil district. At [the end of this period she ventured across the continent to California, the land of lier girlhood dreams.

In four weeks after her arrival she began teaching in Gait, a small town near Sacramento, at a salary of .seventy-five dollars jier month. The next year found her, with an increa.sed salary, at San Jose, where for several years she held the position of vice-principal in the Empire School. Later she went to the city of Oakland, where her career as a teacher in the public schools terminated finally.
