remembered by her classmates at the univer- sity by her successful advocacy of the adoption of the cap and gown, which they were the first to wear, or as being the writer of the class poem entitled "Cap and Gown," delivered at a class supper and afterward published in the Medical Student. After receiving her tliploma Dr. Kirk went to New York ami pursued a post- gratluate course in the New York Post-gradu- ate School of Medicine. Then she returned to Boston, and, establishing her residence in the Dorchester district, entered upon the tluties of her new profession.

She has ac(juired a lucrative ])ractice, cov- ering a territory extending to Neponset and Marblehead on one side and to Cambridge and Maiden on the other. Her physical fitness for her work is testified by her excellent health.

For .several years she was associated with Dr. Alonzo Boothby in the Boothby Hospital, Boston, wherein her duties included the de- livery of lectures to nurses. Her income is far from being an adequate measure of her professional work. Following the best tradi- tions of the profession, she frequently gives her services gratuitously to needy patients. She has been on the staff of the Homoeopathic Medical Dispensary of Boston since 1894, and by the request of school-teachers of Dor- chester she has given hygienic talks to mothers in Dorchester.

Dr. Kirk is a member of the Massachusetts Homoeopathic Society, of the Boston Homoeo- pathic Society, of the Massachusetts Surgical and Gyna'cological Society, and of the Twen- tieth Century Medical Society. Her religious affiliations are with the Episcopal church. She is a patron of the Girls' Friendly Society. In 1897 she was admitted to membership in the patriotic society known as the Daughters of the Revolution.

FLORENCE GARRET1&gt;50N SPOONER, President of the Massachusetts Prison Reform League, has been a resident of Boston the past thirty-two years, her home being in a quiet corner where West End and Back Bay meet, at the lower end of Pinck- ney Street.

Flurt'iicc (ianvttsou Spoouur was horn in Baltimore. On lier mother's side she is de- scen(l(&gt;(l IVom one of the most noted families of colonial history in Marj'land. Her ancestors were of the Dorsey, Worthington, Howard, and Hammond connection, which united the best blood of the State. One of her great-furand- fathers was William liall, closely related to the mother of \\'ashiiigton. The (iarrettsons, on her father's side, weie among the earliest settlers of Maryland and New York. In the year 1752 the Rev. Freeborn Garretson gave up his grants of land, an&lt;l freed his slaves through religious convictions. He became a missi(jnary of the Methodist J'4)isc()])al Ohurch, travelling from the Oarolinas to Nova Scotia on horseback. His wife, Katherine Livingston, was a daughter of .ludge Livingston and sister to Robert R. Livingston, the first Chancellor of New York.

Mrs. Spooner in girlhood and early woman- hood was devoted to music, using her rare voice in many choirs as a gift of love, and be- longing to the most exclusive musical clubs. Her natural talent for organization made her a centre of attraction, where she stood at the helm of many church and society functions. With further knowledge and experience her life broadened and character developed. She served on philanthrojjic conunittees, thus turn- ing into practical channels her symiiathetic and over-al)undant compassion for the sorrows and needs of unfortunates. An earnest and enthusiastic worker in her chosen fiekl of re- form, efficient in many ways, she has been de- scribed as "a religious, consuming .soul, always in communication with the authorities of Church and State, goin&lt;j; straight -on, radiating in a hundred directions, bringing forces to bear on the whole circumference of unusual cruelties. The doors have fallen, and light has illuminated dark places: and she will succeed in what she undei'takes because she has just that faith that will remove mountains, the mountains of [Heju- dice and persistence." Time and the Hour says: " Florence Spooner's name has become as fam- ous as Elizabeth Fry and Dorothea Dix, antl her charity has taken the form of divine fire."
