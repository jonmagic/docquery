centre. She was a charter member of the New England's Woman's Press Club, anil has for ten years held some office on the Executive Board. She also belongs to the Authors' Club, the Pentagon Club, and the Professional Woman's League. Her pajier on "The Making of a Critic," which has been given several times in Boston before prominent clubs, was also given at the Congress of Women's Clubs at the W^orld's Fair.

In 1879 she became the wife of Dr. John P. Sutherland, her friend from childhood, the mar- riage taking place immediately after his gradu- ation from the Medical School of Boston Uni- versity. After several months' travel in Eu- rope, Dr. Sutherland began the practice of his profession, while she continued her literary work. In 1888 her husband became a member of the faculty of the Medical School of Boston University, and since then he has been actively connectecl with that institution, succeeding Dr. I. Tisdale Talbot as Dean of the Medical School in 1899. Dr. Sutherland is one of the leading physicians of Boston, and is an ex-president of the Massachusetts Homoeopathic Medical So- ciety. For fourteen years he edited the Neir England Medical Gazette.

By birth and education, ami as wife of the Dean of Boston University Medical School, Mrs. Sutherland holds a distinct and individual position in Boston, while her work as playwright and critic takes her often, and very congenially, over the borders of Bohemia. She counts some of her warmest frientls among the leaders in the dramatic world. A\'here she sees talent, she is always eager to recognize and foster it.

Her Sunday evenings are the property of her "boys," not only of Boston University, but of Harvard and Tech also. At her home they find on Sunday nights a "picnic supper," a warm welcome, and an "open parliament," whose leader is often the honoreil anil beloved Dean.

Dr. and Mrs. Sutherland have two sunmier residences, one at Nantucket, home of Mrs. Sutherland's kinsfolk two centuries ago, and one, "Clanshome," at Marlow, N.H., between which homes, when not in Dr. Sutherland's na- tive Scotland, she and her husband ilivide their summer days.
