When the family removed to Boston, Mrs.

Andrews' became a memlwM- of the South Con- gregational Church (Unitarian). Elected presi- dent of its ladies' organization, the "South Friendly Society," in 1876, she held that posi- tion until January, 1903, when she declined a re-election. Her service of twenty-seven years is the longest in the history of a society in which only five terms have covered its whole existence of seventy years. In 1883 she heljied to organize the South End Industrial School, an institution founded to give elementary manual training to the children of Roxbury and the South End of Boston. It was sup- ported by Unitarian churches and individvials, the South Congregational Church and many of its members being prominent helpers. Mrs. Andrews was elected its first jiresident, and re- mained in office until 1899, when she retired, after sixteen years of faitliful service.

For some years she was a member of the New England Women's Cluli. She is still a mendier of the Woman's Educational Associa- tion, and remains an interested but not an active member of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. She was one of the or- ganizers of the District Nursing Association and of the Young Travellers' Aid Society, of both of which for a time she was an active mendier and officer. She is also a member of the Women's Anti-suffrage Society, of the Massachusetts Ci^'il Service Reform Associa- tion, and of other smaller organizations.

The South ('ongregational Church, under the influence of its pastor. Dr. Edward Everett Hale, has had witle relations, both inside and outside denominational lines; and these rela- tions have brought to Mrs. Andrews opportu- nities for religious and philanthroj^ic work, to which she has always been ready to respond. While most of these, though requiring much time, work, and thought, are of a local charac- ter, two lines of her work have made her name familiar to a large circle throughout the coun- try. Elected in 1886 president of the AVomen's Auxiliary Conference, she was active in the movement to enlarge its scope and usefulness; and in 1889, when the National Alliance of Unitarian and Other Lilieral Christian Women was organized, she became its tirst jiresident, declining a re-election in 1891.

years she was a member of the Council of the National Unitarian Conference. She is a life member of the American Unitarian Asso- ciation.

In 1887, through the eloquent appeals, and later the personal frientlship, of Pundita Ra- mabai Mrs. Andrews became deeply interested in the condition of the high-caste child widows of India. In 1888 she was largely instrumental in the formation of the Ramabai Association, pledged for ten years to support Ramabai in her work for the redemption of her sisters and the uplifting of her jjeople. To the Executive Committee, of which Mrs. Andrews was made chairman, was entrusted the official corre- spondence concerning the management of the Shiirada Sadan (Home of Wisdom) at Poona, also the settlement of many delicate questions arising from a work so opposed to the customs of India. In 1894, as an officer of the as.so- ciation, Mrs. Andrews visited India, and passed nearly eight months at the Sharada Sadan, in daily intercourse with Ramabai and her pupils, becoming acquaintetl with the details of the home and school, learning the sad histories of the child widows, antl studying their charac- teristics and capabilities. She visited some of the most important cities of India with Ra- mabai as "guide, philo,so|)her, and friend," thus gaining an insight into the social customs and evils of the country such as she could have obtained in no other way. All of this experi- ence enabled her to return to America with ac- curate knowledge and increased power to plead Ramabai's cause and to emphasize the purpose, the needs, and the wontlerful success of the work. In 1898 the term of the original Ra-. mabai Association expired; and the American Ramabai ^Association was then formed, to con- tinue the work on nearly the same lines, which lines were strictly undenominational. At this organization Ramabai was present. Mrs. An- drews was again made chairman of the Execu- tive Committee, and still holds the position.
