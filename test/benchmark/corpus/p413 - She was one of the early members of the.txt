She was one of the early members of the New England Woman's Club of Boston, and always took the greatest interest in its work. She was thoroughly alive to all the burning social questions of the times, ami often con- tributed, either by papers or talks, to the practical solution of such questions.

She continued the active practice of med- icine until 1899, when she felt herself no longer able to bear the strain. With her dear friend and companion, Miss Julia A. Wprague, she retired to a small house in the neighborhood of Boston, where she hoped to enjoy some years of leisure after her strenuous toil. She found, however, that she hail overtasked her splendid physical powers, and during the rest of her life she suffered greatly from a nervous trouble, which made it impossible for her to lead any- thing but an al)solutely quid existence. Ex- hausted by this trouble, she died on May 13, 1902.

By her own request there was no funeral service, but relations and friends gathered quietly, to hear a paper which she had herself prepared for the occasion.

On October 29, 1902, a memorial service was held for her in Chickering Hall, where a notable company, including Mrs. Julia Ward

Howe, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, and Mr. William Lloytl Garrison, Jr., sought to express their appreciation of her. Some of her associates in the hospital spoke of her hospital and medical work, while a German (juartet sang selections from the music she loved.

The meeting was closed by the following benediction from Mrs. Howe: "I pray God earnestly that we may never go back from the ground which our noble pioneers and leaders have gained for us. I pray that these bright stars of merit, set in our firmament, may guide us to a truer love and service to God and man."

EUGENIA BROOKS FROTHINGHAM is a young author whose work in let- ters is as yet designated by quality rather than quantity, her literary abil- ity not having been called into definite use until recently. As a maker of books from choice and not necessity, she can write in leisurely manner and because she has some- thing to say. Born in Paris, France, in 1874, she is of New England parentage, being the daughter of Ivlward and I'Aigenia (Mittiin) Frothingham, of Boston. One of her great- grandfathers on the maternal side was the Hon. Ik'njamin W. Crowninshield, Secretary of the Navy, 1814-lS, under Presidents Madi- son and Monroe.

Her early education was received in this coimtry. She has also studied and travelled wi(U&gt;ly abroad. Of musical and artistic tem- perament, always a student, she is a member of many clubs, among them the Saturday Morning, Authors', and MacDowell.

Her first book, "The Turn of the Road," pul)lished in 1901, possessed a charm and merit that gave it instant recognition. It was one of the six best selling books of the year.

"Only an Episode," vvliich api)eared in the Atlantic, is a story of absorbing interest. It is an instance of keen analysis and strong character portrayal!
