Genial and whole-hearted, Miss Thomas has a fine disregard for conventionalities, and de- spises affectation and sham. With a strong sense of justice, she unflinchingly urges the rights of her .sex, and by her influence has helped bring aliout a number of good 'reforms both in customs anil State laws.

Among her personal friends may be named Mary A. Livermore, Susan B. Anthony (often her guest). Miss A. M. Beecher, Sarah J. Farmer, of Greenacre, and such departed worthies as Charlotte Cushman, Lucy Stone, Parker Pills- bury, John Hutchinson, antl Dr. Elliott Coues.

Mrs. Elliott Coues has spoken thus of Mi.ss Thomas: "If I had nothing ei.se to be thankful for in this life, having had her for my friend would be reason enough for my giving thanks. All who know her will say 'Yes' with a rising vote and a Chautauciua cheer for one of the grandest women ever born on this planet. Did any one ever go there with a tale of woe that she did not try to assist anil strengthen with good, kind words and deeds of corresponding worth?"

Another close friend adds: "If I were asked where under ' Representative Women ' Char- lotte J. Thomas stood, I shouUl class her with tho.se whose watchword is emancipation â€” free- dom of thouglit, speech, and action, wherever such freedom woukl lead to the betterment of mankind. To have original and persistent ideas and to develop them honestly and inde- pendently has been her unswerving aim. These characteristics have shown themselves first and always in the home, where nmsic, society, and hospitality have been of an unusual scoj^e and of choice quality. To high antl low her atti- tude has been and is, 'You have innate noble- ness: give the best in you a chance to show it- self and to increase and benefit your fellow- beings.' Such a trend on the individual side has naturally on public (piestions meant 'anti- slavery, woman suffrage, education without stint, and \miversal brotherhood.' Here is a democratic instinct that does not content itself with word of mouth, but daily puts into prac- tice the precepts it holds flear. The group of personal friends mentioned above are but a few of her companions in the good fight. There's liberty for every happy and uplifting influ- ence to work its wholesome and beneficent way in the minds of men, women, and children in this home which we hold in fee simple as a prejmration for further development and ])rogress."

GEORGIA TYLER KENT was born in La Grange, Ga., eldest daughter of Nelson Franklin Tyler, of Massa- chusetts, and Henrietta Snowden, his wife, of Maryland. She married July 2, LS78, Daniel Kent, a graduate of Amherst College, law student of Boston University, and later admitted to the Indiana bar, son of Daniel Waldo and Harriet Newell (Grosvenor) Kent, of Leicester, Mass.

Mrs. Kent in her school-ilays was thought by her teachers and others to have unusual talent as a writer.

This, at the time, did not appeal to her, and in the autumn
