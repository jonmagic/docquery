Mrs. Morey's extensive travel has brought her in touch with the musical and artistic centres of Europe. Her summers for twenty years have been spent among the Alps of Switzerland, Northern Italy, and the Tyrol, into who.se very fastnesses she has penetrated. She has made her abode with peasants and princes alike, from the humblest chalet of Switzerland to the abodes of I'^ngland's aris- tocracy; amid the sand-dunes and windmills of the Low Countries and the castles of the .Rhine; in the wastes of the Sahara and under the shadow of Egypt's great monuments.

Cosmo])olitan alike by travel and tempera- ment, finding home and friends in many lands, her heart, never thele.ss, remains loyal to the granite hills of the land of her birth â€” the Switzerland of America.

ETTA HALEY OSGOOD, the first Presi- dent of the Maine PVderation of Clubs, was born in Chatham, Carroll County, N.H. When she was two years old, her parents, Thomas Jewett and Lucrctia lOaton (Colby) Haley, removed acro.ss the bordc-r to the town of Stow, Oxford County, Me., and, having been a resident of that State ever since, .she felicitates herself on being a Maine woman.

Mr. Osgood was on the editorial staff of the Portland Arfius, and he encouraged his wife to enter the profession of joui'nalism. She began by reporting conventions, society events, and so forth, and in recent years has devoted the greater part of her time to this work. She is now on the editorial staff of tlie Evening Ex- press and Sunday Telegram.

^^dlen the club movement began, Mrs. Os- good was one of the pioneers. She has assisted in founding several clubs, and is considered an authority in matters relating to i)arliamentary law, her lectures on this subject being one of the results of her club and newspaper work.
