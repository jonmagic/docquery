Miss Greene is descended from Roger Will- iams through the marriage of his grand-daugh- ter, Phebe Sayles, with Major Job" Greene, and also through her paternal grandmother, Caro- line Cornelia Aborn. Indeed, she is descended from nearly every one of the foimders of the colonies of Providence and of Warwick and from most of them in several lines, owing to constant intermarriages.

Mrs. Julia Ward Howe is descended from Deborah* (married Simon Ray), sister of Chief Justice Philip" Greene and daughter of Job' and Phebe (Sayles) Greene.

It is a notable fact that in every generation in Miss Greene's line of the Greenes there has been either a Senator or a Representative from the town of Warwick in the General Assembly, her cousin, Francis Whittier Greene, serv- ing at the present time as Senator from War- wick.

Miss Greene was the first American woman invited to address the World's Congress of Juris- prudence and Law Reform, an honor extended to but two American and two foreign women lawyers, their names appearing upon the same programme with eminent American and Euro- pean male jurists. Miss Greene assisted in

preparing the fifth edition of Schouler on the Domestic Relations, the standard authority in the courts upon that branch of law. She is the only lawyer who makes a specialty of the delivery of lectures upon practical business law before women's clubs and girls' schools, and she finds great interest in the subject among all classes of women, from shop-girls and work- ing-women to the wives of millionaires.

Miss Greene was conmiissioned by the Gov- ernor of Rhode Island chairman of the Rhode Island Committee on a Colonial Exhibit at the Atlanta Exposition; and the Legislature, upon her sole petition as chairman, appropri- ated one thousand dollars for the colonial ex- hibit. This is said to be the first time in his- tory that State funds have been placed in the control of a commission composed exclusively of women, by a direct grant to them from the Legislature itself.
