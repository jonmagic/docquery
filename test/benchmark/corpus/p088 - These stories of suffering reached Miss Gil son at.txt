"These stories of suffering reached Miss Gil- son at a moment when the previous labors of the campaign had nearly exhausted her strength ; but her tluty seemed plain. There were no volunteers for the emergency, and she prepared to go. Her friends declared that she could not survive it; but, replying that she could not die in a cause more sacred, she started out alone. A hospital hatl to be created, antl this required all the tact, finesse, and tliplomacy of which a woman is capable. Official preju- dice anrl professional pride had to be met and overcome. A new policy had to be introduced, and it had to be done without seeming to inter- fere. Her doctrine and practice always were instant, cheerful, and silent obedience to medi- cal and disciplinary ortlers, without any quali- fication whatever; and by this she overcame the natural sensitiveness of the medical authori- ties.

" A hospital kitchen had to be organized upon the method of special diet; nurses had to learn her way, and be educated to their duties; while cleanliness, order, system, had to be en- forced in the daily routine. Moving quietly on with her work of renovation, she took the responsibility of all changes that became neces- sary; and such harmony prevailed in the camp that her policy was vindicated as time rolled on. The rate of mortality was lessened, and the hospital was now considered the best in

the department. This was accomplished by a tact and energy which sought no praise, but modestly veiled themselves behind the orders of officials. The management of her kitchen was like tlie ticking of a clock â€” regular disci- pline, gentle firmness, and sweet temper always. The tliet for the men was changed three times a day, and it was her aim, so far as possible, to cater to the appetites of indi\adual men.

"Her daily rounds in the wards brought her into personal intercourse with every patient, and she knew his special needs. At one time nine hundred men were supplied from her kitchen. The nurses looked for Miss Gilson's word of praise, and labored for it; and she had only to suggest a variety in the decoration of the tents to stimulate a most honorable rivalry among them, which soon opened a wide field for displaying ingenuity and taste, so that not only was its standard the highest, but it was the most cheerfully picturesque hospital at City Point."

It was more than an ordinary task to take charge of the colored hospital service, and the burden was greater than many men could en- dure. But Miss Gilson was ecfual to the emer- gency, and gained the love and respect of all who associated with her. Mr. Reed, who was a witness of her work, said: "As she passed through the wards, the men would follow her witli their eyes, attracted by the grave sweet- ness of her manner, and when she stopped by some bedside, and laid her hand upon the fore- head and smoothed the hair of some soldier, speaking some cheering, pleasant word, I have seen the tears gather in his eyes, and his lips quiver, as he tried to speak or touch the folds of her dress, as if appealing to her to listen while he opened his heart about his mother, wife, or sister, far away.
