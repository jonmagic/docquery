In conclusion, she pre.sented, on behalf of the Woman's Literary Union, this entire collection to the schools of Portland. Mayor Randall ac- cepted the gift in behalf of the school commit- tee and city government. For the first time the citizens of Portland realized in some degree the magnitude and desirability of the work.

Mrs. Burnham remained chairman of this committee for two years. Upon her resigna- tion she was made an honorary member. As such, she yet put her shoulder to the wheel and assumed full care of this work in the North School. She has left no stone unturned to advance the progress of the project. She has solicited subscriptions, aroused interest in un- expected quarters, written and delivereil lect- ures, and has personally presented some work of art to every school building in the city. In her kindly rounds of duty she has been quick to notice opportunities for better arrangement and grouping, and the adoption of her sugges- tions has resulted in many improvements.

Mrs. Burnham was also a pioneer in the club

movement in Maine, having been a member of the Travellers' Club ever since its formation in 1882. In this club she has held various offices. She was the third president of the Woman's Literary Union of Portland, auditor of the State FVderation, and she served on the Board of Trustees of the Invalids' Home.

In many quiet, unobtrusive ways she shares her privileges, her possessions, and her time with others. Mrs. Burnham has a great ca- pacity for winning friends, and in her charming home she exercises a gracious hospitality. She has always been a student of the best books, and has had the advantage of foreign travel.

ELLEN MARIA STONE, missionary teacher, was born in Roxbury, Mass., July 24, 1846, daughter of Benjamin F. and Lucy (Waterman) Stone. Miss Stone comes of sturdy New England stock, being descended from ancestors, on both sides, who were willing to serve their country and their God with all their being, not hesitating to risk their lives, if neetl be, in the defence of the principles of their government or of their religion.

On her father's side she claims descent from Gregory Stone, who, with his wife Lydia, came from Suffolk County, England, about 1636, and settled in Cambridge, Mass. His brother Simon had preceded him to this country, settling in Watertown. Gregory Stone was a member of the Colonial Legion, and his name appears in volume one of the Provincial Records.

Miss Stone's great-grandfather on the pa- ternal side, Eliphalet Stone, of Marlbor- ough, N.H., was one of the leading citizens of that town, taking a prominent part in public affairs. He served in the Revolutionary War. His son Shubael, Miss Stone's grandfather, enlisted in the same regiment toward the close of the war. The latter also served in the War of 1812, as captain of a company which he recruited. Miss Stone's mother, who is now in her ninety-secontl year, distinctly re- members re-unions of this company, with dinner served on the lawn at the homestead in Mail- borough, in which town she lived as a bride.
