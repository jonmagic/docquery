While living in Portland, Me., Mrs. Packard joined the AVoman's Auxiliary to the Portland Army and Navy Union. For many years slie contributed letters and articles to the press in behalf of the soldiers of the Civil War, en- deavoring to awaken an interest in their needs. She has received hundreds of letters of appre- ciation from soldiers in all sections of the country and many official votes of thanks from posts and regimjjntal associations, also lettefs from Dr. Olivei' Wendell Holmes, John J. In- galls, and many distinguished generals of the Civil War.

Invitations ha\e been extended to Mrs. Packard to write for Grand Army gather- ings from Maine to Texas. In October, 1889, at the dedication of the Maine monuments, she read an original poem at the sunmiit of Little Round Top, Gettysburg, entitled "The Voice of Maine." Among the many popular poems she has written are "Decoration Day," "The Old Guard." "In Memoriam," and "Me- morial Day." \\'hen tlie memorial building of the Fifth Maine Regiment was dedicated at Peak's Island, Portland, Me., Mrs. Packard by special invitation read original verses.

The Magazine of Poelrij and lAterary Revieir, in its issue of October, 1895, referred to her work as follows: "All of Mrs. Packard's poems, whether |)atriotic, descrijttive, psychical, in- trospective, or in lighter vein, evince a deep and original mind, a keen insight into nature, a sincere faith, and a graceful and concise mode of expression. Several of her poems have been arranged as songs, a setting for which they are particularly well adapted."

Among the publications in which Mrs. Pack- ard's writings have appeared are the Spring- field R.ej)ul)liran, Homestead and Vniun, the Repidtlican Joiirnal uf Maine, Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekee/pinq, Youth's Compan- ion, Boston Transcript, and various Western papers; among the magazines, the Twentieth Ceniury, New Natiort, and New Idea.

Wilcox Post, and is held in grateful remem- brance by the post and corps, her work for the Grand Army being well known throughout the State. She participatetl as a delegate in several conventions of the Department of Massachusetts, A\'omau's Relief Corps. At the time of the Spanish-American War she was one of the organizers, and was corres])on(iing sec- retary and a director, of the Springfield Aux- iliary to the Massachusetts Volunteer Aid Association. Her two elder sons enlisted for service in Cuba, and Arthur fell on the firing line at El Caney, July 1, 189S, pierceil by a Mauser bullet. The death of this young patriot, only eighteen years of age, and the frantic grief of the ekler brother over his dead body was a fruitful theme for the newspajter correspondents in Cuba, from Richard Harding Davis down to the humblest wielder of the pen; and the ti'agic circumstance was the original of the statue at the I^uffalo I'ixposition entitled " l']l Caney."
