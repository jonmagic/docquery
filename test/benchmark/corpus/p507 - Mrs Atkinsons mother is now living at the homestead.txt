ELLA MAUDE MOORE, author of "Songs of Sunshine and Shadow," is the wife of Joseph E. Moore, of Thomaston, Me., and the chief representative of that flourishing seaboard town in literature to-day. Daughter of Samuel Emerson Smith (Bowdoin College, 1839), she was born in 1849 in the town of Warren, Me. Her paternal grandfather, the Hon. Edwin Smith, of War- ren (Harvard College, 1811), was son of Manas-

seh Smith (Harvard College, 1773) and his wife Hannah, daughter of the Rev. Daniel and Hannah (Emerson) P]merson, of Hollis, N.H. Hannah Emerson, wife of the Rev. Daniel and grandmother of Edwin Smith, was a daughter of the Rev. Joseph* and Mary (Moody) Emerson and sister to the Rev. Will- iam' Emerson, the grandfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Samuel E. Smith, father of Mrs. Moore, re- moved with his family to Thomaston when his daughter was three years oUl. Here she grew up and was educated in the public schools. In early life her literary tastes began to ag^ert themselves in poetic effusions, humorous, sa- tirical, or pathetic, according to her mood or the nature of the subject that had awakened her interest. When but a school-girl, she composed the verses now so widely known, and at the time so much discussed, known as "Rock of Ages," a poem spoken of by the Lewiston Journal as " the most celebrated written by a Maine woman." It was the re- sult of no prolonged or studied effort: it was spontaneous — in the phraseology of the poem, "sung as smg the bird.s in June." It was written, without a thought of its survival, on the inside of an old envelope, which she had torn open at the entls and spread apart, crossing and recrossing the lines to find room. After she had thrown it away, one of the fam- ily picked it up, tleciphered the verses, and was astonished at their merit. Urged to do so, she reproduced the verses, and they ap- peared in the Maine Standard.
