edy roles and enters into such parts with amaz- ing vivacity."

The same paper pubHshes an interview with her in which she tells of her early ambition to become a soubrette, which she was forced to give up because of her rapidly increasing inches. "But the love for cometly still remains," says Miss Lawrence. " It will out, no matter how hard I try to suppress it. I cannot say, how- ever, that I prefer comedy parts to strong emo- tional ones."

Mr. Lewis C. Strang, whose opinion in dra- matic matters is worth good weight in gold, says of her, " Miss Lawrence has the intelli- gence to present with commenilable ease and with more than ordinary success even parts that are not in her line."

Speaking of the extraordinary number of parts she has taken. Miss Lawrence says: "I started at one time to count them, but lost the count. At any rate, I know that the number exceeds that of any other actress. One thing which has assistetl me greatly in my work is my memory. Even when a chikl I memorized so rapidly as to be a source of wonder to my family and friends. Learning a .part is not so much a matter of memory as it is of con- centra tioii, and^l possess that also~T,'o aTfarked degree. "But, while I memorize with facility, I forget as easily. Perhaps I should not say forget: rather, I store away in my mind the impression of a part which I have .icfii" arned, and when I need it again all I have to do is to read the okl role over once or twice-, and it all flashes liack to me. It would be impossible to retain any part when one learns a new play each week, and has no particular reason for thinking of the previous study. Shakesjjeare's plays are exceptions to this rule, I find. I think the reason is that Shakespeare is so deep. His language is so beautiful, so full of mean- ing, and expressed so differently from modern playwrights that one has to study him very thoroughly indeed to understand his lines rightly. With modern plays one could easily substitute one's own words and derive the same or nearly the same effect."

She admits that stock company work is ex- tremely taxing, but finds that it has its com- pensations in permitting her to remain in one

place, instead of roaming all over the coun- try with practically no home nor opportunity to make warm friends. That she has a host of these was clearly proved on the night when she closed her first long engagement at the Castle Square Theatre in the winter of 1900, when the house was filled to its utmost capac- ity with an enthusiastic audience, who testified to their admiration and esteem in flowers and in farewell gifts.

Miss Lawrence is always interested in the people she meets, many of whom remind her of flowers â€” violets, forget-me-nots, roses, pan- sies, poppies, and even sunflowers. Names also appeal to her, ami one of her most cher- ished friendships she owes to this fact. A child who had seen her from before the foot- lights venturecl, to call at her hotel. Miss Lawrence was about to send excuses, when the beautiful name attracted her attention and altered her decision. She also has a great deal of sentiment regarding her wardrobe, planning all her gowns as to color, fabric, and fashion, and finding genuine delight in clothing her various characters. "For instance," she re- marked upon one occasion, " I would not think of using the gown worn as Camille for any other character, for to me that gown is a part of the character itself. Then, too, certain shades seem to go with certain people and be a part of their temperaments."
