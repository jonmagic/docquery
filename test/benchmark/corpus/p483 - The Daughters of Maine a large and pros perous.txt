ESTELLE M. H. MERRILL, journalist, was born at Jefferson, Lincoln County, Me., in 1858, daughter of Oilman E. and Celenda S. Hatch. As a child Estelle M. Hatch attended the public schools of her native town. At fourteen years of age she entered Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Mass., and upon her graduation returnetl to Jeffer- son to teach. At the end of two years' suc- cessful work in that place she again came to Massachusetts, and taught school for three years in Hyde Park. She will always be gratefully remembered as a strong factor in establishing in the public schools of Hyde Park an additional course, giving practical business training, opportunities for which pre- viously could be obtained only at private schools.

A lover of nature from her girlhood, when she u.seil to wander through the Maine woods, iluring h'cr periotl of teaching in the grannnar and high school gratles at Hyde Park .she was fitting herself at the Harvard Aimex and with private teachers to take a professorship in botany, her favorite study. She also fur- nished at intervals articles for the Boston Transcript, written under the signature of "Jean Kincaid."

A break in health, the result of overwork, necessitated rest and change. During her long convalescence she used her pen more and more, her first regular work as a journalist being on the Boston Globe. From furnishing siÂ«'cial articles she progressed to a salaried position. Journalism became such a fasci- nating occupation that, though she was offered a lucrative professorship in botany in a South- ern college at this juncture, she chose to re- main in the newspaper field.
