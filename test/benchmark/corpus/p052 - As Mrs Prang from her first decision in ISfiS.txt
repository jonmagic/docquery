As Mrs. Prang, from her first decision in ISfiS to make public art education her lih^-work, strenuously devoted herself to its promotion, her work as an author has been largely in that direction. She was joint author with John S. Clark of "The Use of Models" (1886); with John S. Clark and Walter Scott Perry of " The Prang Shorter Course in Form Study and Draw- ing," "Form Study without Clay," "The Prang Complete Course in I'Virm Study and Drawing," "The Prang Elementary Course in

Art Instruction"; ;ind with John S. Clark and Louis Prang of " Suggestions, for Color Instruc- tion" (1893). Her latest work is "Art In- struction for Children in Primary Schools," in two volumes (1800).

In the intervals of this very busy life Mrs. Prang has found time to share in other work for the jx'ojjle. She was one of the charter members of the Massachusetts Floral Emlilem Society, wiiich was organized July 4, 1804, by Mrs. Ellen A. Richardson, at Winthrop, Mass. One object of the society is to bring about a more rational celebration of the Fourth of July, and to that end the society endeavors to cultivate a love for the beautiful in the minds of school children by the distribution of flowers on that day. Mrs. Prang was presi- dent of the society in 1898 and 1900, and she inaugurated the public distribvition of flowers to the childnMi of Boston, in 1S98 flowers being given to twentv-five hundred children and in 1000 to nearly four thousand. In March, 1000, and again in February, 1901, Mrs. Prang ap- ]iearetl before the Legislative committee to advocate the adoption of a floral emblem for the State of Massachusetts.
