were ready to lend a hand to any good object. In the spring of 1859 she was asked to take charge of a small hospital connected with the New England Female Medical College of that city.

Feeling that the New York hospital was now well started, and that she might advance the cau.se of women physicians more in another place, she acce])ted the invitation, and came to Boston in June. She did not find' there, however, the cliance for carrying on her own ideas of hospital management, and at the end of three years she resigned.

Her friends now decided to hire a small hou.se and fit it up as a hospital, which should be under her management. It was a cour- ageous untlertaking. It was in 1862. The civil war was at its height, and it was very difficult to enlist public interest in anything else. Few people knew anything about women physicians, and the majority of those who had heard of them, regarded the idea of women doctors with a mixture of incredulity and suspicion.

Dr. Zakrzewska, however, possessed in a high degree, the power of interesting others in whatever she undertook, and she soon gathered about her an enthusiastic group of people, who were devoted to her and her work, and who believed firmly that whatever she undertook would be accomplished.

The hospital struggled on, feebly at first, but soon began to grow, and, after several times enlarging its quarters, was enabled in 1872 to build its present substantial structure in Roxbury. Other buildings have gradually been added, until the institution now includes medical, surgical, maternity, and dispensary buildings, together with a nurses' home and all the accessories of a well-appointed modern hospital.

The hospital staff, which at first consisted of Dr. Zakrzewska and a young assistant, in 1893 numbered over forty women phy- sicians connected with its work; and Dr. Zakrzewska lived to .see all this 'accomjilished.

She held successively the post of resident physician, senior attending physician, and .senior advisory physician, which last she re- tained until her death. As one of the chief

objects of the hospital, as set forth in its charter, is the giving of opportunities for practical work to young women doctors, a large number of them have ^ined their hospital experience in its wards under her instruction. She always took the greatest interest in these stuilents, giving them freely of her great experience, and encouraging them in tlieir anxieties at the beginning of their career. All over this country, and even in Europe, are practicing women doctors, who will always look back gratefully to the advice she gave them, and the things she taught them in the hospital.

Her hospital work ditl not absorb the whole of her time. She gradually acquired a large private practice in Boston and vicinity, and she was well known among ricli and poor for her medical skill, her wise practical ad- vice, and her interest in every class of humanity, and especially in any questions relating to the advancement of opportunities for women.
