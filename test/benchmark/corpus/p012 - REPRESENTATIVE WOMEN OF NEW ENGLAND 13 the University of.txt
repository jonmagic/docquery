REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

the University of Mrgiiiia by a woman. As seen in her poems and speeches in behalf of the restoration of "Old Ironsides," her plea for the Lincoln memorial collection at Washing- ton, D.C., and in the brochure, "An Offering in behalf of the Deaf," concerning speech edu- cation, many another cause has had her helping hand.

Miss Gould is an honorary member of the Castilian Club of Boston, having contributed one of the ablest papers to volume xxvii. of members' essays, presented by the club to the Boston Public Library. Her right-to-the- point speeches on a variety of subjects also made her an honorary member of the Wednes- day Morning Club of Boston. She was the only woman speaker upon the erection of the Abigail Adams cairn, June 17, 1896, under the auspices of the Atlams Chapter, Mrs. Nelson V. Titus, Regent, and was the poet of the Web- ster Centennial at Fryeburg, Me., in the sum- mer of 1902, having been made some time be- - fore, for articles written on Webster, an hon- orary member of the Boston Webster Histori- cal Society.

Her conscientious antl extensive research in historical realms is seen in her interesting book, "John Adams and Daniel Webster as Schoolmasters," for which the Hon. Charles Francis Adams wrote an introduction. This, with its companion, "Ezekiel Cheever: School- master," will, it is said, become the final word on the respective subjects, to be more and more valued as the years go by. Her versa- tility has led to her being the poet of occasions and of movements. Her "Endeavor Rally Hymn," to which her nephew, Willard Gould Harding, composed the music, has been widely scattered. Her "Columbia â€” America," set to music by Adeline Frances Fitz, which is played by Sousa's Band, is the accepted song of the Massachusetts Daughters of the Revo- lution. Two of her Children's Songs, set to music and published by Clement Ryder, are in demand for Children's Sunday. Her verses on the Mountain Laurel, on its proposal as the State flower, were dedicated to the Massa- chusetts Floral Emblem Society. Perhaps Miss Gould is most potnilarly known by her single stanza, "Don't AVorry," which has been copied

far and near, even a little Alaska paper having caught its sunshine, and, widely scattered in leaflet form, has been a comfort to many a troubled soul. Not to mention, for lack of space, the "Songs of the Months" and verses to nota- ble contemporaries and friends, it may here be stated that all that Miss Gould wishes saved of her poetry has been recently collected under the name " One's Self I sing, and Other Poems." A story, "A Pioneer Doctor," a*nd "The Brownings in America," have been recently published.

A book of selections, her "Gems from Walt Whitman," published in 1889, called forth warm response from "the good gray poet": "I want to thank you as a woman," he said, "for the capacity of understanding me; for," he added, somewhat meditatively, "only the com- bination of the pure heart and the broad mind makes this possible." The publication of her "Anne Gijchrist and Walt Whitman" in 1900 gave further evidence of her generous capacity for friendship and her appreciation of that gra- cious quality in others. An official connection with the Walt Whitman International Asso- ciation was accorded to Miss Gould in recog- nition of her labors of love in that direction.
