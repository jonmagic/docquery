In 1890-91 Baron Posse was lecturer on medi- cal gymnastics to the McLean Asylum and in 1890 to the New England Hospital for Women. He w as a member of the Council of the American Association for the Advancement of Physical Education; and at the World's Columbian Ex- position in Chicago he was vice-president of the Congress of Physical Education, also Swed- ish Commissioner of the Tourists' Dei)artnient, Gynmastics and Sports, and was awarded medals for his method of instruction. Boston honored him similarly in 1892, and Antwerp in 1894. In October, 1893, he was placetl in charge of the medico-gymnastic clinic in the Boston Dispensary.

On May 15, 1895, his thirty-third birthday, he received from the King of Sweden a decora- tion of a class never before issued to so young a man â€” that of Knight of Gustavus Vasa, which is bestowed only on those who have brought honor to their native land through special merit or industry.

His untimely death, December 18, 1895, from thrombus, the result of u long periotl of over-taxation of his strength, occasioneil wide- spread sorrow, and calleti forth many warm appreciations of his work and character. Said the Boston Journal: " Baron Nils Posse was of the type of nobleman that America likes best. He was an earnest and successful worker, and

leaves behind a record of having accomplished something and of having done the world some good, and both through his own individual efforts."

The estimate of one who knew him appeared in the Herald, in part as follows: "To every life with whom he came in contact he was a source of inspiration and courage. Such kind- ness was mixed with his sterling qualities, in- tegrity, fearlessness, and steadfastness, that he won and held the deepest heart affection, as well as the highest respect of all who knew him peisonally. He had spent only ten short years of professional work, but those years marked achievement sufficient for a lifetime."

Baroness Posse, who was attending RadciifTe College, at once gave uj) her studies and assumed the management of the gymnasium, her one idea being that her husband's life-work must be carried on. The pupils, when they returned from their Christmas vacation, fintling her in charge, showed their loj^alty by remaining. The alumni and friends of the school foinied themselves into the Posse Memorial Associa- tion. Their object was to purchase the name and good will of the Posse Gymnasium, to re- organize it, and to incorporate it under the name of the Posse Institute of Gynmastics. They were to raise a sum of money sufficient to place the school on a firm basis, its future wel- fare to be guarded by a board of trustees.

During that summer Baroness Posse took her husband's remains to Sweden. She re- turned in August to find the affairs of the Memo- rial A,ssociation in a chaotic condition and a certain faction talking of opening an iutlepen- (lent school. After brief (leliljeration she de- cided to continue the school under her own management. In the two weeks that inter- vened before it was to open, an almost incred- ible amount of work was acconiplisheil ; new teachers were engagetl and some of the old ones re-engaged, and the gymnasium itself was put in repair. On the day and hour appointed, the rc-organized school opened with the largest senior class on record, anel a large entering class. The Memorial Association clevoted the larger portion uf the funds in the treasury to erecting a monument over Baron Po.sse's grave in Stockholm, Sweden. The balance of the
