During the season of 1894 she met Mr. Rein- hold Faelten, brother of the director and a teacher in the Conservatory. On June 23,

1896, they were married, both remaining on the staff of Conservatory teachers for another season, when they resigned to associate them- selves with Mr. Carl Faelten in the Faelten Pianoforte School, which he established in

1897, after resigning his directorship in the Conservatory, at the close of seven successful years. The Faelten Pianoforte School, to the work of which both Mr. and Mrs. Faelten have devoted themselves assitluously, soon outgrew its quarters on Boylston Street, and now occu- pies a complete floor in the new Huntington Chambers. Its steady growth proves the merits of the principles. on which it is reared. Cla.ss work is a feature of the school. The pupils are assembled in large class-rooms, with sev- eral pianos in each, and are tlrilied in the prin-

ciples of music, including sight playing, key- board, written harmon'y, touch, and technique. The piano lessons proper are given privately or in small classes of from two to four students.

A pupil studying at the Faelten Pianoforte School finishes his course a well-roundetl mu- sician, not only skilled in technique, but with an understanding of the great masters, great compositions, and musical history, which gives him a right to claim to be thoroughly educated in music. This instruction week by week is the best thing to supi)ly that musical atmos- phere which makes the German conservatories so valuable to students of music. One feels that Mr. Faelten has surrounded his pupils with a musical spirit which is a stimulus to growth; and their public recitals prove that "concentrated attention, positive knowledge, intelligent ear, reliable memory, fluency in sight reading, and artistic ])ianoforte playing are developed simultaneously."

Mrs. Faelten with her original ideas, cheer- ful nature, and love of music, although yet a young woman, has made a place for herself in the foremost rank of nmsic teachers. Her teaching and playing are an inspiration to both pupil and audience. She has a large circle of frientls in both the social anil musical world, anfl is much sought after outside of her pro- fession.
