Miss Rieker received her early education in the public schools of Falmouth and at Westbrook Seminary. Her nmsical ability, inherited from both parents, who were singers of local reputation and possessed voices of more than ordinary merit, evinced itself in childhood. At the age of seventeen she began vocal culture under Charles R. Adams, of Boston, remaining one season. Returning home, she contimied her study with William H. Dennett, of Portland, to whom she feels that she owes a great deal of her success. By his advice she next stutlied with the great maestro, Olivieri. During her studies with Mr. Dennett she was engaged as conti'alto of the Williston choir, remaining until her departure for Europe in May, LS94. She was also a member of the afternoon choir at the Second Parish Church, under Mr.

Kotzschmar. Her hrst public appearance was in the "Pirates of Penzance," given by the society people of Portland. Her wonderful voice and dramatic power came as a surprise to the large audience, and, although her part was a minor one, repeated demands were made for her little solo. The success of that night was the beginning of her rapiiUy briglitening career. She was now in demand at all amateur operas, one of her most popular roles being Katisha in "The Mikado." While in Portland she was a memljcr of several musical clubs and other organizations, among them being the Haydn (Quartette, wliicli laecame (piite famous thnjughout Ni'W England, the Rossini Club, the Haydn Association, and the Portland Singers' Club. Later she became a member of tlie McDowell Club of Boston.

With Mrs. John Rand, Miss Alice Linwood Philbrook, and Miss Florence G. Knight, sh(^ was sent to re|)resent tlie Portland Rossini Club at the Columbian Exposition. They won for their club a diploma of sjjecial honor for meritorious work; and, in addition. Miss Rieker and her cousin. Miss Knight, were awarded individual diplomas for the most artistic i^erformance of the whole convention, the only individual diplomas given to singers. The awards were made by tw(dve of the lead- ing musical critics of the world.

Li 1894 she went abroad, beginning her European study with Signor Vannuccini in London, contiiuiing under the same master in Florence and again in London the second season, when by his advice she studied also with Signor Randegger in oratorio and English. While in Europe she received much social attenti(jn, l)oth in London and in Italy. Ever since her return to Boston she has tilled the position which she now holds, that of contralto in the choir of Central Congregational Church, one of the best church positions in Boston. She has also devoted herself to concert and ora- torio work. At the Maine Musical Festivals of 1S98 and 1900 she sang with D. Ffrangcon Davies in the oratorio of "Elijah," her success being only second to his. Her voice is peculiarly suited to the contralto score of that work. Another great success was achieved by her
