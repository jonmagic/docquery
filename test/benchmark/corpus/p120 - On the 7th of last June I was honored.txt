teresting exercises and incidents of the occasion will be remembered as long as life shall last. I have visited the home whenever it was possi- ble for me to do so.

"The official correspondence of the year has required much time and thought. I have written more than a thousand letters, and have issued eight general orders antl one circular letter. Many invitations to fairs, camp-fires, anniversaries of posts and corps, have been ac- cepted and thoroughly enjoyed. I have always been received at these gatherings with much courtesy and cordiality. I have assisted at the opening of four fairs, atteniled four receptions, eleven anniversaries, instituted two corps, in- stalled the officers of twenty-four corps, visited many other corps and delivered the Memorial Day address at Leominster. Have been present at headcjuarters every Tuesday, Thursday, and Satunlay, with but two exceptions."

Mrs. I\iiowles served as Department Coun- sellor in 1891, and continued her active inter- est, visiting corps, participating in camp-fires, and other patriotic gatherings. By invita- tion of Granil Army posts she has delivered Memorial Day adtlresses in many parts of the State and in New Hampshire, and has been an elo(iuent missionary for the order. She con- tinues her active work in the Department W. R. C, and has great influence in the con- ventions.

Her portrait hangs upon the walls of the Department headiiuarters in Boston. It was presented by Abraham Lincoln Corps, of Charlestown, in which she is still an active and honored member. Colonel Allen Corps, of Gloucester, the first corps instituted by Mrs. Knowles, has placed in its room at the Soldiers' Home in Chelsea a beautiful banner bearing her name.

She was assistant secretary at the National Convention at Detroit in 1891, and at Wash- ington, D.C., in 1892, was unanimously elected National Chaplain for the ensuing year.

As a professional elocutionist, Mrs. Knowles has filled engagements in many halls and churches in Ma.ssachusetts and other New England States, and has thus aided financially many churches, posts, corps, and other societies. Mrs. Knowles is one of the vice-presidents of the

Executive Committee of Arrangements for the National Convention in Boston in August, 1904. One of the most elo(|uent addresses ever given at a public gathering of the order was her presentation of a flag to the Girls' High School of Boston on behalf of the Department of Mas- sachusetts at its anniversary observance in the People's Temple, Boston, February 10, 1904. She is sure of appreciative audiences whenever taking part, in any service.

She was a member of the Ladies' Aid Asso- ciation of the Soldiers' Home, and now belongs to the New England Helping Hand Society. She is State treasurer of the Independent Order of Odd Ladies, and was for several years secre- tary of the relief fund of this order. Her re- ports to the insurance conmiissioner of Massa- chusetts were complimented by that official, who regarded them as the best reports receivetl from any fraternal insurance organization.
