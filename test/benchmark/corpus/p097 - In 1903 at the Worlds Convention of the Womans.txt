In 1903, at the World's Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Geneva, Switzerland, Dr. Purington was ap- pointed World's Suijerintendcnt of the depart- ment co-operation with missionary societies; thus being enabled to unify her life-long work in two great Jields of Christian activity.

In both missionary and temperance lines Dr. Purington's contributions to leading periodicals, her manuals and leaflets, have won recognition and hearty praise. Especially valuable arc her life studies in the field of health and hered- ity. Her character and literary style are for- ^- ful, original, and clear-cut. She says o icr- self, '"The open secret of my life is the same as Charles Kingsley's: I have a friend, not only the One above all others, but in the sweetest human sense, as interpreted by Jeremy Taylor: ' By friendship I suppose you mean the greatest love, and the greatest usefulness, and the most open communication, and the noblest suffer- ings, and the most exemplary faithfulness, and the severest truth, and the heartiest coun.sels, and the greatest union of minds of which brave men and women are capable.' " Her intellectual awakening she tlates from the early beginning of this friendship, which has been to her a chief source of happiness as well as of stimulus to growth. She believes with Evelyn, "There is in friendship something of all relations and something above them all."

Boston, October 16, 1S53, when the old West End was the residence of some of the leading citizens. A few years later the Kent faniilj' moved to Belmont, Mass., and thence to Charlestown, where, in the olil and spacious house, 25 Monument Square, the daughter still lives with her present husbatnl, Truman Lee Quimby, to whom she was marrietl November 21, 1901.

Her education was acquired in private schools, the one from which she was graduated having been Miss Catherine Will^y's, afterward Miss Ellen Hubbard's, at 52 Bowdoin Street, Boston.

From her early childhood Alice Kent's love for reading and recitation was pronounced, and this taste was carefully nurtvu'(Ml during the last three years of her school life by her teacher in literature, the late Theodore Weld. His en- thusiasm for the study of Shakespeare he was .successful in transmitting to his pupils, being especially so in her case. She first appeared on the amateur stage in Boston in 1871, taking the role of Lady \'iola Harleigh in " Dreams of Delusion," and showed unusual promise for a girl of eighteen. The part of Sir Bernard Harleigh was played by George Riddle.

Some time afterward Miss Sarah Starr (aunt of the renowned Starr King), a woman of marked individuality and culture, and pos- sessed of discriminating literary taste, urged her young friend Alice Kent to interest herself in Robert Browning. The poet was then gen- erally consideretl too obscure for comprehen- sion, and was not widely read in this countr}'. Miss Starr, who was an ardent admirer of lirowning, little thought that this suggestion would, after her death, be so richly fruitful. The inunediate result was the i)urchase of two second-hand volumes of Browning, which the girl read with lukewarm interest from time to time.
