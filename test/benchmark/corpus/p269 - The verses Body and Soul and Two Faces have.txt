EMMA MYRTICE WOOLLEY, M.D., was born in Owasco, Cayuga County, N.Y., July 8, 1859, daughter of George and Catherine (Freese) WooUey. Her ])arents were married in the town of Aurelius, in the same county, in 1852. Her grandfather and grandmother Freese were ' of Dutch origin, and were among the pioneer settlers of Ulster County, New York. When their daughter Catherine was a small child, they journeyed to Indiana in a wagon â€” a remarkable trip it was considered, that State being regarded in tho.se days as a part of the "Far West." After a two years' battle with fever and ague they returned to the little farm in Aurelius to spend the remaining days of their lives.

George Woolley, father of Dr. Woolley, was born in Cayuga Comity in 1831. He was edu- cated in the common schools and the Auburn Academy. He followed farming until 1873. In that year he sold his farm in Owasco, and removed with his wife and their three children to Auburn, where he worked at various trades. In 1887, having removed to the Freese home- stead in Aurelius, he resumed his former occu- pation. He is living in that town at the pres- ent time, as active as any of his younger neighbors. Mrs. Woolley, the Doctor's mother, died May 9, 1900. She was born in 1830. For several years previous to her marriage she taught school.
