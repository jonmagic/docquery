measure to her systematic and practical method of teaching, (^ne of the first managers of the school said recently, "Mrs. Lincoln made the Boston Cooking School." She is often intro- duced as "not only the first jjrincipal, but the first principle of the school," and "the woman we all cook by," and so forth. After six years of faithful ami arduous service she resigned her position, on account of the sudden death of her sister and the serious illness of her mother, who died five months later.

A year before leaving the school she wrote the "Boston Cook-book," which added greatly to her reputation, and was at once pronounced " one of the most practical and reliable cook- books ever written." It has had a large cir- culation among housekeepers, and is used as a text-book in many of the leading schools, not only in America, but in l']ngland, Constan- tinople, anil among the missionaries of China.

Since leaving the confining care of the school, Mrs. Lincoln has been heard as a lecturer in more than two hundred different towns and cities, from Maine to California. She has given over seven hundred special lectures on cookery and domestic science, always l)y invitation, in addition to teaching the first class in the B(js- ton Normal School of Cookery and teaching three years at La.sell Seminaiy. She has also written several new books and a score or more of pamphlet recipe books for food manufacturers, besides many articles for magazines and house- hold papers, always by special request.

Her best known books are her " Boston Cook-book," "Carving and Serving," "The Peerless Cook-book," and the "Boston School Kitchen Text-book." The latter was the first complete book for use in the public school cooking classes. From the second month of its issue Mrs. Lincoln has been culinar)' editor and one of the owners of the American Kitchen Magazine. Since October, ISflS, she has written weekly articles for a syndicate, which are jiublished in daily and weekly papers all over the country.

Over one hundred thousand copies of the "Boston Cook-book" have been sold, and it is still in great demand, having been revised in 1900, with the addition of about three hundred new recipes. Doubtless, many housekeepers

will echo the sentiment of the cook who, after repeated failures from following the directions in other books, exclaimed, " No, Mrs. T., the pudding was no good. I tell .you, we can't do any better than to stick to old Mary Jane."

Mrs. Lincoln's latest printed volume is "A Cook-book for a Month at a Time," and her latest business venture is the manufacture of a pure cream of tartar baking jiowder, bearing her name, which is meeting with a ready sale.

The following is quotecl from one of many press notices of Mrs. Lincoln: "Her personal magnetism, her naturalness, her enthusiasm and enjoyment in her work, win her many friends and pupils wherever she lectures. While instructing, in language as clear and explicit as if her audiences were children, she never forgets that her hearers are ladies, and she an- swers the most absurd questions with unfailing patience and respect. She confines her talk to the subject at hand, and does not try to fill up every moment of the time l)y talking just for effect or to create a sensational discussion."-
