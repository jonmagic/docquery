as teacher of the Bunker Hill Primary School (No. 6). While holding the position, her success as a teacher being established, she received a flattering call to teach in Toledo, Ohio; and her declination was received with regret by the superintendent of schools of that city.

In 1873 she resigned her position, and became the wife of George Henry Pendergast, a well- known and highly respected citizen of Charles- town. They now live in Somerville, having recently removed to their new home, at the corner of Broadway and Sycamore Street. They have two children: Florence Worth, born April 17, 1886; and Harold Worth, born Feb- ruary 14, 1892. These children were the nucleus of the Jonathan Thompson Society of the C. A. R.

Mrs. Pendergast was actively identified with the First Universalist Church of Charlestown for many years, and was before her marriage one of a party of young amateurs who aided the church treasury by giving theatrical enter- tainments, in which she filled the role of lead- ing lady with considerable merit. The Norum- bega Woman's Club, of Charlestown, welcomed her as a member soon after its organization. She accepted an election as its vice-president, but has declined the honor of becoming presi- dent, which has twice been tendered. Although continuing her interest and membership in the club, other duties prevented her from accepting its leadership. Mrs. Pendergast is a life member of the Hunt Asylum for Destitute Children, is interested in the Win- chester Home for Aged Women, and has been an early and continuous friend of the Boston Floating Hospital, a charity very near her heart.

In February, 1898, Mrs. Pendergast with others organized the Jonathan Thompson So- ciety of the Children of the American Revo- lution, and she conducted it successfully for over two years, holding most of the meetings in her own home. In April, 1900, she gave up its presidency (but continues as a contribut- ing member), and assumed the duties of Regent of Bunker Hill Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution. She is a charter mem- ber of this chapter, and served three years as

Vice-Regent before accepting the ofhce of Regent. The chapter prospered under her guidance. Her progressive ideas, executive ability, and efficient management met the ap- proval of the members. The term of office as Regent expired in April, 1902.
