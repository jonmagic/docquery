SUSIE CHAMPNEY CLARK.— Near the summit of Nonantum Hill, which marks a boundary between Newton ami Brighton, Mass., the subject of this sketch was born. Her parents, James Clark and Welthy Jane (Park) Clark, came of sterling stock in the Green Mountain State. The mater- nal ancestors, Daniel Harrington and Welthy (Ladd) Park, were of Puritan descent, the progenitor of their line, Richard Park, being a landed proprietor in Cambridge, Mass., in 1636. The paternal grandparents, Nathaniel and Betsey Clark, claimed for their posterity a faint strain of North American Indian blood.

As the story has oome down, passed, lip to Up, from one generation to another, a Ch\rk maiden was carried into captivity by a chisky chief- tain in the French and Indian War. He soon after, most amiably, passed to the happy hunting-grounds of his race, his captive re- turning to her people in \'erniont, where his son, who bore the family name of his mother, Clark, became the progenitor of a line of male descendants, each bearing many of the better traits of the red man, tempered and modified by civilization, such as stalwart physique, keen love of nature, unusual strength of memory, with a marked gift of healing. Miss (^lark is said to be the seventh in descent from the chieftain, the towering height of some of her ancestors being obliteratetl in her very diminutive or- ganism. She lived in Brighton until her eighth year^ when, after the loss of her fathei-, she removed with her mother to Quincy, 111., where in the broad, free life of the A\'est the forming years of her gii-lhood were spent. When she hail reached the age of fifteen, her mother was again married to Francis H. John- son, of Cambridge, Mass., which city has since been her home.

Always delicate in health and completely prostrated a year or two after her removal to Cambridge, Miss Clark for many years was a confirmed and partially paralyzed invalid, her opportunities for school training being thus restrictetl to the high schools of Quincy and Cambridge. But the Infinite Wisdom makes no mistakes in training its instruments for appointed service, and an education was gained on that pillow of prolonged suffering which no university could grant — an educa- tion in the .sense of educing those latent powers of the soul which can only gain fruition through the growth of the spiritual or psychic nature, thus encouraged by enforced seclusion from the world of physical and mental activity. It was a hard and painful curriculum, one sadly prolonged by ignorance concerning the power of the spirit to dominate physical conditions and by unconsciousness of her own innate gifts of healing. But there came an hour, as she approached her third decade, when the purpose to be thus wrought seemed fully accomplished, when from the gates of death, through which

she had nearly passed, she was raised almost instantaneously, miraculously, as it seemed, by the agency of a modern exponent of the science of healing, to perfect health and strength, an emancipation which, in the many useful years that have since elapsed, has known no illness, no pain, or exhaustion, although she has come constantly in touch with disease of every kind.
