" She was brave as she was loving. I have seen her sit unmoved and silent in the midst of a severe cannonade while soldiers were fleeing for refuge. I have seen her almost alone in a contraband camp and hospital. In the midst of ignorance ill-suited to her, vice that must have been repugnant, and squalor in all its repulsiveness, she moved, an angel of mercy, loving and loved. She gave, in all her minis- trations, health to the diseased, comfort, inspi- ration to the dying, strength to the timid, knowl- edge to the ignorant, and to the depraved the beauty of purity. . . . Her earthly life seemed but a type of the heavenly."

She was charitable in judgment, ready to forgive those whose lips had questioned her fidelity or the purity of her motives, antl ecjually ready to confess her faults. She often said, true affec- tion does not make us blind; but, although keenly alive to the errors of those we love, we can the more readily pardon. With confidence in her ability to work in responsible positions, she was humble, and did not desire notoriety, declining always to furnish for publication any history of her army life.

"Her faculty in arranging a hospital, her tact in managing the patients and the soldier nurses, her ability to pray and sing with dying men, to conduct religious and funeral cere- monies, her adaptation to circumstances, her courage in hours of danger — all fitted her for the service she performed. ... In her presence the profane lip was silent, and she won the re- spect and love alike of friend and stranger, of the aged, of whom she was so thoughtful, and of the young, whom she so readily instructed and amused.

"Loving her Saviour, she loved the divinity in our humanity, and believed that all good thoughts, words, deeds, are divine; that we are but the channel through which they flow, and that the divine current is sure to deposit in our hearts the seeds of constant joy. This was the only reward she sought." ... — f. b. f.
