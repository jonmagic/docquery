Miss Pilsbury began lier work five years ago by studying with .Miss WcW, of Philadelphia. In the spring of 1S99 she came to Boston, rented a studio on Boylston Street, in what was once an old dwelling-house, and courageously began business among a host of well-known ])ho- tographers. The original ciiaracter of her work gradually brought her into notice, and her reputation spread. While Miss Pilsbury lays no claim to high artistic achievement, she has made it her .aim in her professional work, by the substitution of simple nietliods for the older stilted methods, to .secure for parents records of the unconscious charm of their children.

and in Ikt portraits of older people has worked for natural and at the same time slightly ideal- ized results.

It is in her portraits of children that she es- pecially excels: children, feeling that she un- derstands them and sympathizes with them, are at ease with her. She sometimes uses a simple flat lighting, suggesting Boutet de Monvel's pictures of children. Her best por- traits are noticeable for their unstudied pose, softness of outline, and interesting lighting, an excellent example being a picture of an old lady seated by a window, the play of light and shade over her face softening it very charm- ingly.

Miss Pilsbury has made a distinct advance each year in the character of her work. She is not content to stand still or to follow in one beaten track. This spirit of experiment antl revolt from the conventional has made her work uneven. She has perhaps attempteil more than she could carry out, for a lens has many limitations. But the mistakes she has made have been just so many encouraging signs of progress. In the end she has gained.

Miss Pilsbury is a member of the Arts and Crafts Society of Boston. She has exhibited in the Photographic Salon of Philadelphia, in the Salon of the Linketl Ring in London, and in several other cities.

JOSEPHINE ROACHE was born in the pretty village of Beaver River, on the shores of the Bay of Fundy, in the country of Evangeline, June 25, LS45. Her father, Israel Roache, was born in Gran- ville, N.S., being a son of Frederick and Eliza- beth (Ricketson) Roache.

His father, Frederick Roache, a native and lifelong resident of Granville, dietl at the age of ninety on the farm that had been his home for' many years. He was a man of indepen- dent opinions, taking an active interest in pub- lic affairs and in promoting the welfare of the village. His ancestors came to America from Waterford, Ireland, in the early part of the eighteenth century.

Israel Roache's mother was a refined and delicate woman. Her ancestoi's went to Nova

Scotia from Mrginia before the breaking out of the Revolution, doubtless leaving some of their kinsfolk in that State, as the name Rick- etson, it is said, is still known in the South.

The maiden name of Josephine Roache's mother was Almira Corning. Her earliest ancestor in America, Sanuiel Corning, who arrived in Salem, Mass., as early as 1638, was among the founders of Beverly, where there is now Corning Street, named for the family. Her father, Daniel Corning, was one of the first settlers of Beaver River, having left Bev- (&gt;rly some years before the Revolution. Her mother, Mrs. Abigail Perry Corning, also be- longed to a family that went from Massa- chusetts to Nova Scotia before the Revolution. Mr. and Mrs. Israel Roache, wishing to edu- cate their children in the United States, the ])ublic school .system not then having been introduced into the British Provinces, came to Salem, Mass., when Josephine, the eldest child, was six years old. At the breaking out of the Civil War Mr. Roache enlisted in the Thirty-fifth (Massachusetts) Regiment. He was in the laattles and campaigns shared by the Ninth Army Corps, at South Mountain, An- tietam, and later in the battles of the ^^'il- derness; and at the battle of Cold Harbor he was taken prisoner, and, after a short con- finement at Libby Prison, was sent to Andcr- sonville, where he ilied in 1864.
