HELENA HIGGINBOTHAM.— Among the authors who have recently made their bow to the public, and who have met with instant appreciation, is Helena Iligginbothani, of Springfield, Mass. She was born in Philadelphia in 1874, but came as a tiny chikl to Massachusetts, since which time her home has been in Huntington and Springfield.

Her father, John Francis Higginbotham, was born and reared in Manchester, England; while her mother, Helen Hazelhurst Higgin- botham, was of Spanish origin.

After a three years' cour.se at the Spring- field High School, MLss Higginbotham, who from childhood had .shown much talent for sketching, took the two years' course in draw- ing at the Cowles Art School, Boston, later attending the Art Students' League in New York. Nature has endowed Miss Higgin- botham generously with mental and physical gifts. When a little girl she sketched with ease, and in occasional fits of petulance ea.sed her injured feelings by making quick carica- tures of tho.se who had offended her. These were .so clever that the subjects, instead of feeling re.sentful, were lost in admiration. It was as easy for her to use her pen as her cray- ons; and, though too shy for a long time to offer her literary work, she gradually began contributing to newspapers and magazines. In Septemlx'r, 1902, Lee &amp; Shepard published her book, "Rover's Story," which she had il- lustrated herself. She has another volume in progress, and intends to make literature her profession. Some of the articles contributed by her to magazines are not what might be considered of a literary nature, most of them being on mechanical subjects, such as wiring hou.ses for electric bells and for lighting gas by an electrical current. In electrical engi- neering she takes a great interest, and her arti- cles on this subject are ba.sed upon personal experience. She .says in regard to it : " Having wired nine houses, and after keeping them in repair without the aid of an electrician, I have found the occujiation far more interesting than literature, even if one does have to climb lad- ders to fasten insulators above the second- story windows, to attach the outside wires,
