" She has loved and been loved so -often In her long immortal years That she tires of the worn-out rapture, Sickens of hopes and fears.

" No joys or sorrows move her, Done with her ancient pride; For her head she found too heavy The crown she has cast aside.

" Clothed in her scarlet splendor. Bright with her glory of hair, Sad that she is not mortal — Eternally sad and fair —

" Longing for joys she knows not, Athirst with a vain desire, There she sits in the picture. Daughter of foam and fire! "

Could anything be in stronger or more glori- ous contrast to the "House of Death" or to "Arcady" or to that great sonnet, "At War," or show more varied power?

Few people coukl have met such praise and appreciation as Mrs. Moulton received, so calmly, so sedately and gently, without one flutter of gratified vanity. Indecil, she is to-day the most modest and most humble- minded of women.

With the exception of the two years immedi- ately following Mr. Moulton's death, when she remained at liome and in seclusion, Mrs. Moul- ton has every summer sailed away for the foreign shores where she is so welcomed and so loved. Although possibly few Americans have had such a social as well as literary suc- cess abroad, the hospitality she has received has never been violated by her in pen or word: she has printed no letters and uttered no gos- sip concerning the houses in which she has been a guest. She has been, through all antl everything, a woman of unerring sense of right and courtesy, of whom all other Americans may be proud. Every winter sees her back in Boston, where her house is a centre of liter- ary life, and where one is sure to find every stranger of distinction. For her acquaintance among English people of prominence is as ex- tensive as among those of our own country. The friend of Longfellow and AVhittier and Holmes in their lifetime, the acquaintance of Boker, and Emerson, and Lowell, and Boyle O'Reilly, and of Sarah Helen Whitman (the fiancee of Edgar Allan Poe), of Rose Terry and Nora Perry, as she is still of Stedman and Stod- dard, Mrs. Howe, Arlo Bates, Edward Everett Hale, Howells, William Winter, Anne Whitney,

RErRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Alice Brown, Louise Guiney, and, in fact, of almost every one of any interest or achieve- ment here, her English acquaintance was and is e(]ually extensive, as she has been on pleas- ant terms with Sir Walter Besant, ^\'iliiam Sharp, Dr. Honler, Mathilde Blind, Holman Hunt, Mrs. Clifford, Mrs. Campbell-Praed, Coulson Kernahan, John Davidson, Kenneth Ctrahame, Richard Le Gallienne, Anthony Hope, Robert Hichens, William Watson, George Mere- dith, Thomas Hardy, and Alice Meynell, not to speak of Christina Rossetti, William Morris, Jean Ingelow, William Black, and many another of both the living and the dead.

It is in Boston that she has done the greater part of her work, collated and collected a few of her many stories and of her essaj's into vol- umes, written her books of travel, "Random Rambles" and "Lazy Tours," books full of interest, published her four volumes of poetry, and edited and prefaced with biographies "A Last Harvest" and "Garden Secrets," and the "Collected Poems" of Philip Bourke Marston, and also a selection from Arthur O'Shaugh- nessy's verses, generous with her time, her effort, her money, and her praise.
