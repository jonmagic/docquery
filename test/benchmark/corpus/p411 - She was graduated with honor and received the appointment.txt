She was graduated with honor, and received the appointment. Unfortunately, Dr. Schmidt died immediately after, and she was left with- out his aid, in a position which was coveted by many, who were consequently unfriendly to her. Finding it impossible to maintain this position without losing her self-respect, she soon resigned. Her friends were desirous that she should settle in Berlin, but she had meanwhile conceived of a hospital for women, attended by women; and, although she dared not tell any one of so wild a project, she deter- mined not to be satisfied until it was fulfilled. Knowing this to be impossible in Berlin, she turned her thoughts toward America, as a place where she might be free to carry out her intentions without the limitations surrounding her in the Old World.

On March 15, 1853, accompanied by one of her sisters, she left Berlin, and after a tem-

pestuous voyage landed in New York on the 22d of May. Coming without friends, anil entirely ignorant of the English language, it is not wonderful that she at first found no encouragement for her project.

She had tletennined on no account to ask help from her father, and tlierefore, when she found tliat there was no inunediate pros- pect of earning her living by practicing her profession, she turned her practical ability into other channels, and for a time supportcil herself ami her sister by manufacturing worsted goods and other articles.

Although she was quite successful in these ventures, she never forgot her real object in life. Her introduction to Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, which occurred about a year after her arrival in this country, she rightly con- sidered the turning-point of her fortune in America. Dr. Blackwell at once discerneil the unconnnon ((ualities of the stranger, in spite of the foreign language, and inteicsted herself most heartily in her behalf. She told her that she must learn the English lan- guage, and obtain the degree of Doctor of Medicine from a reputable college before she could hope to practise successfully. Through Dr. Blackwell's influence she was admitted to the Cleveland Medical College, where she was graduated in 1856. After her graduation the faculty, as a mark of respect for her character and abilities, remitted her lecture fees, for which she had been obliged, for lack of ready money, to give her promissory note. She returned to New York, and took an office with Dr. Blackwell, who had opened a small dispensary for women and children, and was trying to collect funds for the establislunent of a small hospital in connection with it.

Into this project Dr. Zakrzewska entered with heart and soul, and by her contagious enthusiasm aided greatly in accomplishing it. In May, 1857, the New York Infirmary was opened. P\)r two years she gave her time to it gratuitously, acting both as super- intendent and resident physician.

During these years she had several times visited Boston in the interests of the New York work, and thus become acquainted with a circle of noble men and women who
