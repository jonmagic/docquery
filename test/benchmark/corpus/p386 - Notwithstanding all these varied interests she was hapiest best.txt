Notwithstanding all these varied interests she was ha|)piest, best known, and best be- loved in her own honie. Sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews, all turned to her for ad- vice, sure of a loving sympathy in all that con- cerned them.

It is impo.ssible in so short a sketch to do justice to her many-sided character. She loved every bieathing creature; and many a forlorn, neglected animal in her neighborhood has she liefriended. Babies were her especial care, and her interest did not cease with the need for medical attention. Her heart went out to the poor, and many were the sick and needy who were gladdened by receiving the doctor's bill receipted, sometimes followed by donations of food and clothing. When the holidays were near, the Merritt kitchen was a busy place, and various were the dishes of good whole- some food, prepared often by tired hands, that were carried late at night to households where such dainties had been hitherto unknown.

was onlj' when some friend whose calls pene- trated to all parts of the house discovered the workers at their tasks that these benefactions became known; for one of the watchwords of that household was, "Let not thy left hantl know what thy right hand doeth."

Dr. Merritt's original and independent habit of thought on all subjects could not fail to evince itself in her religious belief. Without seeking opportunities, she did not shrink from ex|iressing her own individual persuasion when conversing with jjcrsons of a different faith. Her love of truth could not abide the obvious jjievarications of those who believe in the evangelical doctrines, yet live in utter disre- garil for the welfare of others, apparently only desirous to benefit self. Many have heard her tjuote the memorable words of Thomas Paine, "The work! is my country, to do good is my religion." 80 well was this known that the Ladies' Physiological Institute, of which she was jiresident, in selecting for her a birthday gift, chose an exquisite little statue of Paine, which she prized more highly than she could have ilone some more costly token of ordinary senthnent.

At one time, perhaps in the eighties, the opportunity came for Dr. Merritt to witness in her own house some of the then unusual {ihe- nomena of sj)irit power, and her interest was arouseil to make a study. of this belief. All went well until one evening she was called away. On her return, being told of the ful- filment of a promise that "something more wonderful than before would be given when the conditions were all favorable," she im- pulsiveh' exclaimed, "I don't believe it"; and for several years utterly re])udiated all her former conclusions. Afterward, however, she felt that it had been a mistake to throw away such opportunity, and asked a friend, when they were about to i)art for the sunmier, to keep her in mind and write to her if she had any message.

In her earlier days she was called an atheist, but she disavowed this charge by referring to another state of existence, and in her last illness, speaking of the hereafter, said, " There'll be work for me to do there." She died Novem- ber 7, 1900. Premature as her transition
