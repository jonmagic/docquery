It was of Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney that Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote some twenty or more years ago : " We have in New England a lady writer who for our times and seasons has done very nmch the work for young people that Mi.ss Edgeworth ilid in hers; while her writings are spicy and amusing, they have a decided in- fluence upon the character, an influence any parent might be thankful for. . . . She excels in painting simple, lovely, perfect homes and nice, gentle, natural young people. . . . The

religious teachings of her books have no cant phraseology, but they show how the spirit of Christ may be brought into actual life."

In the words of another thoughtful critic: "Mrs. Whitney is a sworn foe to sentimental- ism. She hates fine language, fine speeches, hue professions of virtue and piety and friend- ship. Her characters, if her favorites, are seldom afflicted with long tongues. . . . She has read nmch ami knows nmch, ami shows inci- dentally and without pedantry her botany and geology antl astronomy, and that she keeps up with the science and philosophy of the day, and is familiar with the best authors. . . . But, after all, we return to her genius for religion and for teaching religion by fictitious characters, characters working out their own salvation umler ordinary human and New England cir- cumstances, as the cardinal glory antl charm of these books."

Mrs. Whitney has had four children â€” three (laughters and a son, Theodore T. One daugh- ter died in infancy. The eldest married in 1867 Major (now Colonel) Suter, of the United States army, and died in the same year. The- odore Train Whitney occupies the old Whitney homestead in Milton, his mother living in a little hou.se that she built for herself a few years since in his grounds. Mr. Whitney has a son, Theodore T., Jr., and three daughters.

Mrs. Whitney's youngest daughter, Caroline Leslie, married James A. Field, of Beloit, Wis. At the time of his death, in 1884, their home was in Lakewood, N.J. Mrs. Field was the author of "High Lights," a novel, and of "Nannie's Happy Childhood," an attractive book for girls. She died December 1, 1902, leaving three sons. The eldest son, William L. W., is instructor of natural science in Milton Academy and at the summer school in Alstead, N.H. The .second, James A., is a teacher at Harvard L^niversity, where he was graduated with honors in 1903. The third, Douglas Grahame, is still a Harvard student, as is his cousin Theodore, above named. Mrs. Whitney has also a great-grandchild, the son of ^^'iIliam L. W. Field, who was married in 1902.

Mrs. Whitney, it is pleasant to record in closing, expresses herself as being very happy, in these latter days of her eightieth year, in
