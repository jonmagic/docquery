To return now to Miss Whitney, the sculptor. Twenty years ago, hi a book on " Famous Women," appeared a sketch of the life of Anne Whitney, which, though incomplete, later biographers and paragraphists writing on the same subject have failed to surpass in sympa- thetic flelineation of character and achieve-

ment. "Fortunate in her parentage and in her early training," says this sketch, "Anne Whitney passed through childhood and youth into womanhood under most favorable condi- tions. The simplicity and nobility of nature which strongly marked the parents are traits in the daughter, as are their individualism, their strength of character, their loftiness of moral tone. She has also inherited an inter- est in public affairs and reform, an uncon- querable aversion to any and every form of in- justice, and a vital belief in human betterment."

"As a child she was bright and joyous, over- flowing with animal spirits." In the school- room she was a general favorite. "Said one of her teachers, 'She always brought in with her such a sense of freshness and purity that instinctively I thought of the coming in of the morning. Every teacher in the school observed her, anil all rejoiced in her. ... A gentle grav- ity, a .sweet intelligence of infrequent speech, or a pervasive kindliness of manner marked her intercourse with her fellow-students, it being always apparent that she was with, but not of, them.'"

Slowly her girlhood pas.sed into womanhood. With soul growth came new susceptibility to outward impressions, whether of beauty and of joy, or of sorrow and pain, while far above the possibility of attainment soared her cher- ished ideals. Fortunately the gift of expres- sion was not denied. She wrote as prompted- from within, wrote as the spirit gave utterance. \ modest volume of poems, published in 1859, was the result. Poems of "remarkable qual- ity," says Mrs. Livermore. Not that they made their author famous: rather may it be said, "Fit audience they found, though few." It was Samuel Johnson, himself a poet in the same order, who wrote of them, "They send the repose of absolute truth and spiritual in- tuition through the aspirations and conflicts of life, and give us its poetry and highest philos- ophy."

An extended critique, both admiring and judicial, appeared in the North Avierican Re- view, contributed l)y Harriet Prescott Spofford. "The publishers," she remarks, "did not give it [the book] their best style. The advertise- ment was limited, the criticism casual. . . .

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

'Earnest' and 'thoughtful' have been the only adjectives to spare. Earnest and thoughtful! What verses, if otherwise, would deserve a notice? Was there no more to say for poems overflowing with beauty, serene and calm, yet instinct with the fire of a proud, passionate nature? . . . But neither keen eye nor sym- pathetic h(\art makes a poet. ... A lyrical and tlramatic power is needed, together with that sway over language which welds a fancy immutably into its own sentences. This last the author has in the highest degree: every word strikes home; every line is clear, distinct as if cut in stone ; the pen in her hands becomes so like the sculptor's chisel that one questions if poetrj' be the fittest exponent of her genius. Her logical power is entirely beyond question, but the dramatic element is entirely wanting. ' ' "A Last Dream," the dream of an arctic hero — Kane — is characterized as a "wonderful poem, which climbs with strong and stately steps to the last line."
