iam Douglas, who was horn in 1610, "without doubt in Scotland," came to New England in 1640, and in 1660 settled in New London, Conn., where he was a deacon of the church.

Mrs. Hannah Cleveland Chandler was born at Pomfret in 1783, daughter of Solomon' and Hannah (Sharpe) Cleveland. Her father was a soldier in the war of the Revolution. Her mother (great-grandmother of Mrs. Moulton), described as "a woman of rare intelligence and wonderful gift of language," was a notable student of Greek literature.

Games, dances, romances, were things forbid- den; and, as playmates were few, the child lived in a worUl of fancy. "I was lonely," she has said, "and I sought companions.
