and felt, when peace was declared, that the "boys in blue" no longer needed her aid. It was not long, however, before she realized that, though the conflict was ended, the suf- fering it caused remained. Her patriotic work was continued, and when W. L. Baker Post, No. 86, G. A. R., was organized at Northamp- ton, Mrs. Clark entered heartily into plans for its success. She was the first President of W. L. Baker Relief Corps, auxiliary to Post No. 86, which was instituted May 13, 1885, and she was re-electeil two succe.ssive years. At the Department Convention in 1887 she was chosen a delegate to the National Con- vention in St. Louis, and has since partici- pated in .several National Conventions. In 1888 she was cho.sen by the Department Coun- cil to fill a vacancy in the office of Department Chaplain, was re-elected to the position by the annual convention in 1889 and again in 1890. On account of severe illness Mrs. Clark retired from active work the following year, but in 1892 accepted the office of Department Senior Vice-President, and upon the expiration of its term was nominated for the highest office in the gift of the convention. Mrs. M. Susie Goodale, Past Department President, pre- sented her name as follows: â€”

" I have the honor to place in nomination Mrs. Emily L. Clark, who has many qualifi- cations for the position. First of all, she has a heart filled with love for humanity, and very few are the days when .some poor wounded soul does not seek and find comfort beneath her sheltering roof. In all this she is seconded by her .soldier husband. Again, she is a pioneer in the order, and has servetl you faithfully as Department Chaplain and Senior Vice- President. I believe her to be in every way qualified for the position."

Mrs. Clark was unanimously elected, and upon assuming the duties of her office gave special attention to the interests of the corps throughout the State. Though living one hundred miles from Department headquarters in Boston, she was on duty there several days each week. A summary of her work was given in her address to the convention of 1894, over which she presided with grace and ability. During the year she travelled more than twenty

thousantl miles, and visited seventy-two corps, besides attending many camp-fires, receptions, anniversaries, and fairs. Three corps were in- stituted during lier administration, making a total of one hundred and fifty-nine corps under her charge. She aimed to encourage all in the noble work in which they were engaged. Mrs. Clark issued nine general orders and two circular letters, huntlreds of copies of which were mailed to ilifTerent sections of the coun- try. Referrmg to her personal work, she said: " I have written more than twelve hundred letters, answered innumerable questions, and endeavored to instruct and encourage all who asked for advice. The many personal letters I have received, expressing appreciation for help given, will be to me a storehouse of pleas- ure in the coming years, when I shall have leisure to again read these words of commenda- tion."
