" ' Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I ? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'

" There can be no doubt that, measuring by quality, not quantity, your place is in the very foremost rank of poets. The divine sim- plicity, strength and subtlety, the intense, fra- grant, genuine individuality of your poems will make them imperishable. And as they are of no school they will be fresh, as the old delights of earth are ever fresh." And again the same poet wrote her concerning "The House of Death" that it was one of the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. " No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Sum- mer without — light girdling darkness — and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced."

" Not a hand has lifted the latchet Since siie went out of the door — No footstep shall cross the threshold Since she can come in no more.

" There is rust upon locks and hinges, And mould and blight on the walls.

And silence faints in the chambers, And darkness waits in the halls —

" Waits as all things have waited

Since she went that day of spring, Borne in her pallid splendor

To dwell in the Court of the King :

" With lilies on brow and bosom, With robes of silken slieen. And her wonderful frozen beauty The lilies and silk between.

" Ked roses she left behind her, But they died long, long ago : 'Twas tlie odorous ghost of a blossom That seemed through the dusk to glow.

" The garments she left mocked the shadows With hints of womauly grace, And her image swims in the mirror That was so used to her face.

" The birds make insolent nmsic

Where the sunshine riots outside. And the winds are merry and wanton With the sunnner's pomp and pride.

" But into this desolate mansion, Where Love has closed the door, Nor sunshine nor sunnner shall enter, Since she can come in no more."

The reader must agree with the critic that this poem of "The House of Death" is un- equalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness.

It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, "Laus \'eneris," inspired by a paint- ing of his own, that Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.

" Pallid with too much longing, White with passion and prayer, Goddess of love and beauty. She sits in the picture there —

" Sits with her dark eyes seeking Something more subtle still Than the old delights of loving Her measureless days to fill.
