HANNAH J. BAILEY, of Winthrop Centre, Me., National Superintend- ent, W. C. T. U., Department of Peace and International Arbitration, was born in Cornwall-on-the-Hudson, July 5, 1839, being the daughter of David and Letitia (Clark) Johnston and the first of a family of eight children. Her father was a minister in the Society of Friends, and her mother one of the most devoted and loving Christian women who ever helped to make a home. Her maternal ancestry has been traced back to Samuel Clark, of whom the compiler of a brief genealogy issued (second edition) in 1897 says: "I find that the probabilities are very strong that Samuel Clark, Sr., came from England

in 1630, the year in which Governor Winthrop, the Rev. Richard Denton, Thomas Wicks, and over a thousand others first sailed to Amer- ica. With the last two named he was closely associated at Stamford, Conn."

During her childhood the subject of this sketch attentled the district schools of Corn- wall, until her parents removed to Plattekill, in Ulster County, New York, about seventeen miles from her birthplace. There she became an eager student in another district school, to which she had to walk a mile each day. Afterward she was sent to a Friends' boarding- school in her native State. Here, as well as by her own independent efforts, by much read- ing and in other ways, she acquired a good practical education, but never ceased to regret her parents' limited circumstances, which ren- dered it impossible for her to pursue a college course. For nine years after returning home she taught school. She then became the wife of Moses Bailey, a well-known oil-cloth manu- facturer, of Winthrop Centre, Me.

After Mr. Bailey's ileath, which occurred in 1882, when their only child was a boy of twelve, Mrs. Bailey showed rare executive ability in conducting his extensive business affairs. This she tlid for nine years.

Being a birthright member of the Society of Friends, always strong in its [)eace princi- ples, Mrs. Bailey is admirably adapted to inter- est others in the work of her Department of Peace and International Arbitration. The work accomplished has been mainly of an edu- cational character. Peace bands have been formed among children, clergymen invited to preach in the interest of the cause, and peti- tions have been circulated. To this work Mrs. Bailey was appointed in 1887 by the National Union and in 1888 by the Wodd's Woman's Christian Temperance Union. As a result of her persistent efforts and those of her co-workers, the Peace and International Arbitration Department of the W. C. T. U. has been organized in twenty-eight States and in the District of Columbia. It is now organized in fourteen cf)untries, and there are also many lands in which effectual work is being done unofficially. The W. C. T. U. Peace Department has taken part in all the

World's Peace Congresses held since its organi- zation. Among its publications are two offi- cial papers, one for adults and one for children, and two books called "Voices of Peace" and "Gleanings on the Subject of Peace and Arbi- tration." The department, in connection with other peace societies of the world, observes the third Sunday of December each year as Peace Sunday. Able lecturers are busy, going about a great deal of the time educating public opinion in the interests of this important work.
