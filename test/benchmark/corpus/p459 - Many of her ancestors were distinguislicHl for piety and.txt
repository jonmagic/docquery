Many of her ancestors were distinguislicHl for piety and scholarship, some being noted lawyers and two great-uncles filling the ofhce of Secretary of State in Maine. Her grandsires on both sides fought in the Revolutionary War, also in the War of 1812.

Her father, Samuel Mills, who was an intense abolitionist and a public-spiriteil citizen, taught his daughter to take an interest in the leading topics of the day. When only a school-girl, she attended with him meetings which were addressed by Daniel Webster, Rufus Choate, Charles Sunmer, Wendell Phillips, and other great orators of that j^eriod. These early les- sons had a marked effect upon her character. Her education was begun in the public schools of Portland, but, her parents removing to East Boston in 1849, her school studies were com- pleted in that city.

In 185.5 Sarah E. Mills married George W. Fuller,, of Canton, Me. In 1861 the call for seventy-five thousand men aroused a spirit of patriotism that left its shadow on her threshold. Mr. P\iller respondinl to the call for volunteers, but was rejected as physically unable to bear the hardships of war. In 1862 he volunteered in the naval service, on the gunboat " Roanoke," but his frail constitution was d(H'med a barrier. He did not, however, abandon the hope of serv- ing his country. On February 12, 1864, he enrolled his name for the third time, and was mustered into the .service six days later as a

member of Company C, Fourth Massachusetts Cavalry. The regiment remained in camp at Readville until April 24, when it sailed from Boston for Newport News, Va., on the steamer " \\'estern Metropolis." At Petersbiu'g in the following June Mr. Fuller was stricken with malarial tyi)hoid fever, and was removed to the hospital at Portsmouth, Va. He died July 2, 1864, and is buried in the National Cemetery at Hampton, \'a.

As stated aliove, from the early days of the Civil War Mrs. Fuller assisted in preparing hos- pital stores and other comforts for the soldiers. She also participated in many patriotic con- certs given in Maine and M;issachusetts for the hosjMtal fund. The ilay after the news of the battle of Antietam was received at the North, she arranged with the help of a few others a concert fnjm which four hmidred dollars were realized. This money was converted into ar- ticles which were forwarded to the front in less than two days after the concert was given. For seventeen years Mrs. l^'uller was a faithful member of the Handel and Haydn Society of lioston.

Remembering with gratitude that one of the noble band of army nurses ministered to her husband in the hospital, she has consecrated her life to the soldiers' cause. She represented Ward One of Boston on the Executive Com- mittee of the Christian Conunission. \Mien the Grand Army of the Rei)ublic was formed, its objects enlisted her sympathies. In 1871 she assisted in forming a Ladies' Aid Society, auxiliary to Joseph Hooker Post, No. 23, of East I^oston. She served as secretary, vice- president, and president, also as a delegate to the State convention of Ladies' Auxiliary So- cieties, held at Fitchburg, February 12, 1879. At this convention the Woman's State Relief Corps of Massachu.setts was formed. Mrs. Fuller was cho.sen president, and was the first signer to its constitution. She was re-elected to this office in 1880 and in 1881. That she won the suj^port of many who were at first sce|)tical in regard to tli(&gt; success of the move- ment is now a matter of record. There were not a few discouragements, but voice and pen united to surmount them; for, eloquent in speech and convincing in argument, Mrs.
