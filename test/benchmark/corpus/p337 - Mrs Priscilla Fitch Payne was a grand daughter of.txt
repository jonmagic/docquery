Mrs. Priscilla Fitch Payne was a grand- daughter of the Rev. James Fitch, of Say- brook and Norwich, Conn., and his second wife, Priscilla Mason, daughter of Major John Mason, of Norwich, for many years com- mander of the colonial forces and nine years (1660-69), Deputy Governor of Connecticut.

Dudl(&gt;y B. and Mary P. McLean had five children, all born at the McLean homestead in Simsbury. The eldest child, Hannah Bishop McLean, married William H. Greeley, and for some years resided in Lexington, Mass. She is now a widow living in Cambridge, her son being a student at Harvard. Charles Allen McLean (deceased) is survived by his wife and two children. John Bunyan McLean, educa- tor, is now a professor in the Westminster School in Simsbury. (ieorge Payne McLean, lawyer, born in October, 1857, was Governor of Connecticut in 1901 and 1902.

Sarah Pratt McLean, the fourth child in this family of five, grew up under careful home training. She attended both district and pri- vate schools during her childhood, but studied far more with her mother, a woman of broad culture. The old Pvu'itan ideas and ideals pre- vailed in the McLean household. The sacred- ness of th(&gt; Sabbath was impressed on the children's minds, and the parents strove to have all the influences of that home good and elevating. Books there were in plenty, and wlien Sarah, or Sally, as .she was called, was sent to Mount Holyoke Seminary, she was well equipped to do good work. Her mind was stored with general reading. She knew and loved nature, and was frankly interested in all her new experiences. The rules were rigid at Holyoke, and some of the regulations seemed

irksome, even to one brought up in a Presby- terian minister's family. But she stood well in her classes, and made warm friends of girls anil teachers. Even at this time her literary talent showed itself, and one of the poems which she handed in as a composition was sent away by her teacher for publication. The verses called "De Massa ob de Sheepfol" she wrote when she was only a young girl, though they were never printed until they were put into the mouth of Mxanna, a character in her second book, "Towhead."

She remained at Mount Holyoke two years. A classmate who had left school earlier to teach on Cape Coil, being unable to continue with the work, urged Miss McLean to take the school. She decided to do so, nmch to the sur- prise of her family; and, almost before they could accustom themselves to the idea, she had gone to the scene of her labors. She found her- self amid surroundings that were full of strange- ness. Sailors on .shore were a new type to her. The idioms of the people, their customs and traditions, impressed her with their novelty. For five months she taught and learned at Cape Cod. After reaching home, she used, at odd moments, to put upon paper recollections of these months, until they took on the form and sequence of a book. Since this was done simply for her own entertainment and with no thought that the manuscript would meet other eyes than her own, she used the familiar names ; and, when the story seemed finished, .she put it in a box, and shoved it away on an ujiper shelf in her grandfather's library, dismissing the matter from her mintl. A kinsman living in Boston, in touch with the makers of books, happening to express the desire that Miss McLean would write .something for publication (since he had noticed that she was a most clever letter-writer), she took the manuscript down from the library shelf, and, without con- sulting any one, nailed a cover on the same little wooden box which had held the loose sheets all this time, and drove to the village express office to speed the literary venture on its way. Then she returned home to await the verdict. The suspense was brief . The pub- lisher sat all night over the manuscript, and wrote the next morning that he wished to bring
