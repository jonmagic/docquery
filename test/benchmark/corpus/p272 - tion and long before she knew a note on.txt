tion, and long before she knew a note on the piano was an object of interest to those who watched her childish fingers unerringly extract melodies from the keys. Subsequently devel- oping talent as a vocalist, at the early age of fourteen she toured with an opera company appearing in several leading parts. At the age of twenty she was travelling as a member of the Balfe Opera Company of New York, with which she scored her chief success as Lady Harriett in "Martha." Later she spent four years touring under the auspices of the Red- path Lyceum Bureau.

Feeling a strong desire to gather laurels in the field of musical composition, she became a diligent student in the higher departments of music, studying in London with Randegger (under whom she did her first work in compo- sition) and with Henschel. In Paris and in Belgium she is a great favorite. She has a high soprano voice of great purity and sweet- ness.

In 1894 Miss Thomas began composing con- cert songs, and in 1900 she began publishing them in London. While residing in that city she studied composition and harmony at the Guild Hall, under Professor Gadsby. She also instructed pupils on the piano, finding a some- what select and congenial field in teaching ladies who could sing to play their own accom- paniments.

As among the most pleasant experiences con- nected with her foreign travels she recalls her stay in Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands. Yet there were incidents connectetl with her visit to Wales which render it memorable. Her father's family being formerly dwellers in the south of Wales, she took a special pleasure in learning the language, songs, antl folk-lore of the country. While visiting the old Malvern par- ish church, which Jenny Lind used to attend, and to which she was a most generous con- tributor. Miss Thomas noticed that, while many others had been honored with memorial windows and tablets, there was nothing to signify remendirance of her. The man in charge, questionetl as to the reason of tliis strange omission, replied that he supposed "nobody had ever thought about it." Miss Thomas took pleasure in placing a wreath of

laurel and a flag on tlie grave of the great artist, and, making a donation, asked the man to place a contribution-box upon the walls, with a printed request, inviting visitors to assist in procuring a tardy memorial to the wonderful songstress and noble, pure-hearted woman.

They were Welsh frienils who urged Miss Thomas to publish the Japanese Love Song, which so impressed Mr. Boosey, of London, the great music publisher, that he requested all her work. This song was enthusiastically re- ceived by the nuisical world, and i-eached the sale of twenty thousand the first year. The composer has since pviblished "The Mechanical Doll," Eugene Field's "Toy Land," "Wing Tee Wee," "Jai)anese Dance" (for string or- chestra), now being used in the London ])rotluc- tion of "The Darling of the Gods," also an Ave Maria, which has been enthusiastically re- ceived in London, "My French Lesson," and "Chasing Butterflies." In Leipsic, with Bos- worth, she published "Peace on Earth," a Christmas song, the words of which she wrote under the name of "Eaton Churchill." Her usual professional pseuilonym, " Clayton Thomas," is a combination of both her father's and mother's family names. She is now busy on other works, but does nothing hurriedly; and surely her music is original and choice enough to be well worth waiting for.
