auxiliary is witnessed by the following, which he officially promulgated in a general order dated February 16, 1883:â€”

"The commander-in-chief is delighted to learn that the loyal women of the land are form- ing auxiliary societies everywhere. The grand work done by these organizations is worthy of the highest praise.

"The Woman's Relief Corps of Massachusetts is hereby particularly mentioned on account of its perfect organization and the work it has accomplished. The President of the same, Mrs. E. Florence Barker, of Maiden, Mass., will be happy to furnish information. " By commantl of "Paul Van Der Voort,

" Commander-in-chiej . "F. E. Brown, Adjutant-general."

In general orders issued May 1, 1883, an- nouncing the arrangements for the Seventeenth National Encampment, to be held in Denver, Col., July 24-28, Commander-in-chief Van Der Voort cordially invited representatives of the Woman's Relief Corps and othej- societies work- ing for the Grand Army of the Rejjublic to meet at Denver and perfect a national organization, adding: "They should bring their rituals, rules, by-laws, and plans of organization, and if pos- sible agree on a uniform mode or system of procedure throughout the country. I pledge the noble women who compose these societies that they will be warmly greeted and given all the encouragement possil)le. Miss Clara Barton has promised to be present."

At a meeting of the board of directors of the Department of Mas.sachusetts, W. R. C, held in Boston, June 27, 1SS3, Mrs. E. Florence Barker, Mrs. Sarah E. Fuller, and Mrs. Liza- beth A. Turner were chosen delegates to repre- sent this department at the convention in Denver. It was voted that the Department of New Hampshire be invited to unite with Massa- chusetts in sending delegates.

Mrs. Barker presided with grace and tact over the deliberations of the women's con- vention at Denver, which was attended by delegates from several States. At the sec- ond day's session it was voted to form a Na-

tional Woman's Relief Corps on the same basis as that of the Department of Massachu- setts, provided the National Encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic shoukl decide to recognize this action. Several of the delegates present refused to endorse the clause in the rules and regulations admitting to membership other women than relations of soldiers.

This clause also caused a lengthy discussion in the National Encampment when the resolu- tion of endorsement was debated, for several conu'ades who believed in a woman's national organization opposed any movement in its be- half that would not restrict the membership to relations of soldiers.

Past Conunantler-in-chief George S. Merrill, of Massachusetts, said : " We certainly, com- rades of the Grand .\rmy of the Republic, cannot afford to do anything that can by any possible means be construetl as discourteous or hostile to any of the loyal women of America."

Comrade William Warner, of Missouri (since Commander-in-chief), participated in the de- bate, saying in part : " I come from a State that has no organization, and that has no interest in any differences between the various organi- zations. I come from a State in which there does not breathe a loyal man who does not ex- tend the right hantl of welcome to every sister, mother, or sweetheart within her borders, whose heart beats in sympathy with us."
