ABBY KELLEY FOSTER was the /\ descendant of a long line of Quaker _/ ^ ancestry, English on the mother's side, Irish on the father's. From the former came her unflinching determination, her almost dogged persistence, her unyielding will where a principle was at stake, her .severe judgment of all who failed to reach her lofty stantlards of morality. With the Celtic blood came her cheerfulness, her ingenuousness, her childlike simplicity, and utter lack of self- consciousness. Her inability to keep a secret, even when of an important character, was the source of much amusement and occasional annoyance to lier friends. Of Irish wit she had not a trace, though she could thoroughly enjoy a joke when it was explained to her.

Mrs. Foster hail a clear, though perhaps, an unusual, conception of the distinction be- tween the possible and the impossible. What- ever was right and just she firmly believed to be possible. To right a wrong or to accom- jilish an important object, she would move lieaven and earth; but she wasted no energy in useless repining over the inevitable. It was

this philosophic resignation to the necessary ills of life, combined with a remarkable elas- ticity of temperament, which enabled her to endure the intense nervous strain to which she was for numy years unavoidably subjected, and helped to prolong Ijeyond threescore years and ten a life, in childhood frail, in youth and middle age constantly overburdened with se- vere mental and physical t(jil.

Soon after her birth in the little town of Pelham, Mass., January 15, 1811, her parents, Wing and Diama (Daniels) Kelley, removed to Worcester, where the little Abigail, because of her delicate health, was allowed to grow up in comparative freedom from the restraint imposed upon the girls of her day. But, in spite of this, she used to tell me that she con- stantly rebelled against the limits set to the physical activity of girls. She felt it a humili- ation to be permitted to go on the ice only in tow of some condescending boy who might offer to tlrag her behind him by a stick. But she would climb trees and fences, and coast down hills on barrel staves, undeterred by the epi- thets "hoyden" and "tomboy," heaped upon her by the girls who only played with dolls in the house. Thus early did she exhibit that love of freedom which was her leading trait through life.

Her mother, the strictest of orthodox Friends, taught her children to follow with unquestioning obedience the leadings of "the Spirit," that inner voice which the world calls conscience. It was to this early training of the conscience and the will that Mrs. Foster attributed her moral strength in later life. The severe discipline of the household was miti- gated, however, by the genial influence of the warm-hearted, impulsive father, whose kindly nature found expression in tender affection toward his children and aliounding hospitality to a large circle of friends.
