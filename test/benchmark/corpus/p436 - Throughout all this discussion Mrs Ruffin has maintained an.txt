Throughout all this discussion Mrs. Ruffin has maintained an attitude of womanly dignity, and has the cordial sympathy and regard of thousands of friends.

In November, 1900, the Woman's Era Club issued an official statement of the whole mat- ter, addressed to the members of clubs of the Ceneral Federation, its conclusion being .summed up as follows. Could anything Ije clearer tljan the logic of their jjosition?

"The General Federation of Women's Clubs has no color line in its constitution. There is nothing in its constitution, in its oft-published statement of ideas and aims, in its supposed ad- vanced positifin upon humanitarian ([uestions, to lead any club, with like aims and views, to imagine itself ineligible for membership. The A\'onian's P&gt;a Club having been regularly ad- mitted, no legal or moral ground can possibly be found upon which it could be ruthlessly thrown out at the pleasure of a few individuals."

The action taken by the General Federation at the biennial convention lield at I^os Angeles in May, 1902, was such as to render it practi- cally impossible for any coloretl club to .secure recognition. The reply of the Woman's Era Club to (juestions in regard to its status in 1903 is this:â€”

"It stands just as it stood before, and just as it would have stood had the reorganization plan been carrietl tlirough successfully. As a part of the State Federation, it has member- ship in the general body; as an individual club, it has all the legally executed documents which eminent legal authority declare justifies our club in considering itself as much an individual member of the G. F. W. C. as any other cluli in that bodv" (Annual Report of the AVoinan's Era Club fo'r 1902-1903).

".hme 1, 1903, the annual meeting was held, and for the first time in the histor}' of the club there was a change in presidents.

"The retiring president, Mrs. Josephine St. P. Ruffin, foun(l(&gt;r of the club, has for eleven con- tinuous and harmonious years occupied the l)osition of club president, with honoi' not only to herself and its members, but to the whole race. She positively decrmcil anf)ther re-elec- tion becau.se of the prej^siu'e of other work. In her retirement the club keenlv feels its loss;

and, to assuage to an extent tliis feeling and retain a claim upon her ability and foresight, and still to have her valuable aid and counsel, tlie clulj voted to create for her the position of honorary president with active rights.

"The newlv elected officers for the year 190:M904 are: President, Mrs. Hannah Ciike Smith; First Vice-President, Mrs. R. C. Richard- son; Recording Secretary, Mrs. M. Cravatt Simpson; Corresponding Secr(&gt;tary, Mrs. K. T. Moore; Treasurer, Mrs. E. Taylor-Cotton; Au- ditor, Mrs. M. E. Wingfiekl." "

The report shows that the Woman's Era Clul) continued its useful activities during 1902- 1903 with good results, that year being pro- nounced the most successful in the club's ex- istence. One thing upon which the club justly congratulated itself in the report was the "l)rfimineiit part it had taken in promoting the gootl work of enlarging Mrs. Sharpe's home school in Liberia." Of the American Mount Coffee School Association, formed in January, 1903, to aid this school, Dr. Edward Everett Hale was chosen president and Mrs. Ruffin a vice-presitlent.
