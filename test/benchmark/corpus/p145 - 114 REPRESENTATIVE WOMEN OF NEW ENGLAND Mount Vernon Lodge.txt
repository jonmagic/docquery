The Woman's Relief Corps lost one of its earliest and most earnest friends by the death of Colonel Barker. It was he who framed the first resolution ever presented in a department encampment of the Grand Army of the Repub- lic, endorsing a State Relief Corps.

The death of Mrs. Barker occurred less than a year after her husband's passing. Memorial services were held by corps throughout the country, posts of the Grand Army joining in these tributes to her memory. Her portrait has been placed in department headquarters in Boston.

The home in Maiden of Colonel and Mrs. Barker welcomed prominent guests from many vStates. One room was devoted to relics, among them a jewelled swortl, presented to the Colonel by the officers of his regiment; his commission as military governor of Danville, Va.; a bolt fiom Libby Prison, in which he was confined several months; and hanging on the walls of the room was the engrossed testimonial, above named, which she cherished as a valuable sou- venir.

Colonel and Mrs. Barker are survived by two daughters and one son — namely, Florence,

Blanche, and William E. The last named is in business in Boston, and resides at Maiden.

The daughters are married, and their home is in Kentucky.
