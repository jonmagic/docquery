A few months later her own life work of min- istration to the sick and suffering, of uplift- ing humanity from physical bondage, opened before her, a service she might never have chosen, but she could not be disobedient to the divine prompting or to the call of human need. She has never made any claim to public {)atronage or recognition, but has performed lier mission unobtrusively, courting obscurity rather than popularity. Her name has never appeared among the advertisements in the press or on any door, at home or abroad; and no cure among her many phenomenal cases has ever been publicly reportetl. Yet many of the most noted authors, editors, and pro- fessional literati of the country are numbered among her grateful patrons, while the poor and the destitute have likewise abundantly shared in her ministrations. That her success has been unvarying, she claims is due to the fact that the element of personal effort is so largely eliminated from her work. She feels that the healing is done through her instrumentality, not by her, through a baptism from the one Power in the universe, with whom " all things are possible." Through her psychometric gift, or by the u.se of the soul's sense of touch, she has made accurate diagnoses of internal con- ditions, reflecting them in her own conscious- ness as if in a mirror placed in front of the patient. Psychic or soul healing, she claims, reaches the realm of causation, and gains at-one-ment with the hidden springs of Being as does no other method.

Miss Clark is allied with none of the modern healing cults. Christian, mental, or divine science, her work being representative of a distinct and individual type. For eighteen years she has labored constantly, in season and out of season, not alone in Boston and its extended suburbs, but in New York, Brook-

lyn, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, and throughout California, where during five winters she has had a large and successful practice. She has also lectured widely in the cities above mentioned on spiritual and ethical topics, teaching many classes, outlining her gospel of health, presenting spiritual truth and the true science of Being through color symbolism and also through musical vibrations, inter- pretations which have proved very helpful to the many lives thus blessed and uplifted. For a time she held in Boston regular Sunday services, which served as a means of growth and refreshment to interested auditors. Of late, public speaking on a wide range of sub- jects has largely taken the place of the work of healing, though this duty can never be wholly laid aside. She claims that the true doctor, as the name (docere, to teach) implies, nmst ever be an efficient teacher.

Miss Clark wields also a prolific pen, and some of her books have become household benefactors. Not a few instances have been reported where marked healing has occurred from reading her early volume, "A Look LTp- ward," a book which had to be replaced in the Boston Public Library because the first copy was worn out by constant use. Other similar works of hers are entitled "To Bear Witness," "Pilate's Query," "The Melody of Life," and "Key-notes for Daily Harmonies." To quote from the New York Press: " Miss Clark presents her gospel in language quite free from the illogical and dogmatic statements of some writings in this line, and with the clear touch of psychic illumination which many others lack. Her message is one of life, of liberty, of purity, health, and the most exalted s])irit- uality. It is a sincere, earnest, and heljjful endeavor to raise mortals above the low mate- rial plane on which too many are content to exist and toil and suffer." In lighter vein she has written spicy sketches of travel in "The Round Trip from the Hub to the Golden Gate," "Lorita, an Alaskan Maiden," and " Souvenirs of Travel." Among her metaphysi- cal pamphlets are included "What is Thought?" "The New Renaissance," "Is it Hypnotism?" "Metaphysical Queries," and "Short Lessons in Theosophy." Much editorial work has also
