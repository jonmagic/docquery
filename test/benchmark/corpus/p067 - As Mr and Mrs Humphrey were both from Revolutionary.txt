As Mr. and Mrs. Humphrey were both from Revolutionary sires, there was some toughness in the grain, which we may suspect descended to our friend ere we are through. Though she may be pleased to acknowledge in her.self some of the qualities of her father, it is probable that her more characteristic features are drawn from her mother, of whom accordingly a word. Though the unpretending servant of many cares, she was much more than an ordinary woman. Her early opportunities were poor enough, but through the eagerness of her mind she acquired an education that was consider- able. She and another young lady together led the way of womankind in that region in the study of Latin. This was, of course, to the wonder of the practical about her, who could not see how Latin could be of any use in housekeeping, and who perhaps felt with Milton that one tongue was enough for a woman. To be sure, there were other things that she might have studied quite as profitably; the important fact was that. she studied something, that her mind reached out for more than the common satisfaction. And what she gained, Latin and whatever else, if of no use in her housekeeping, was of incalculable use to herself. The allotments of her life were not easy, scanty means and seven children were her portion, but through the interests of her mind she coun- terpoi.se(l them. From the pressure of her cares

she might have degenerated into a drudge; through her intellectual interests she preserved the fair estate of a woman. It goes without saying, too, that these interests were most profitable to her children, animating a cease- less watch and toil and sacrifice for their edu- cation.

To Mrs. Humphrey-Smith's education we now come. Her schooling was in the main in the schools of the town. These, however, brought within reach a range of study that was considerable. The district, or common, schools had, of course, their elementary curriculum, to which they were officially supposed to be restricted. But, given a teacher who had knowledge and good nature, the possible achievement was much more than this; and such a teacher was often provided, with a view to the needs of more ambitious pupils. In a brief recitation before school in the morning or a half-hour or so after school in the evening how much could be done! I myself thus brought out of the common school Smyth's treatise on algebra, than which at that day no college in the country would have given me more, some knowledge of geometry, astron- omy, physical geography, and two books of Virgil. But we also had a peripatetic high school supported by a fund, which gave us a term every autumn in three districts of the town. This was distinctly for higher studies. In both district and high school our friend comes before me, a happy memory. Her eager mind took whatever there was for it. In all her studies she excelled ; in one line, however, she was incomparable. Others might keep pace with her in language or in mathematics; but no one, pupil or teacher, could read as she could. Her reading was without ostentation, but. it thrilled and charmed. It comes home to me now as I write â€” the justness of her em- phasis, the faultlessness of her articulation, the melody of her intonation. There are pas- sages of literature floating in ni}' memory, choice in themselves, but doubly valued be- cause associated with the music of her tones. As I look back now, I see that her reading was informed by a nascent dramatic jiower which in its development has enthralled multitudes since. Mile. Lundberg did great service to the world
