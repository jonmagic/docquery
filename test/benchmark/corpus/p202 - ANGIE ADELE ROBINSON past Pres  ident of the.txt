was tlic opening year of the Civil \\'ar and, as she says, " a trying time to make a start in the world." Mrs. Robinson's brother, George Mor- timer Kidiler, enlisted in September, 1861, in Company C, Fourth New Hampshire Regiment, was taken prisoner at the battle of Deep Bot- tom (or Deep Cut, as it is sometimes called), and suffered in Libby, Belle Tsle, and Salisbury Prisons for nearly ten months. He was paroled March 9, 1865, but lived only eleven days after reaching his home in Worcester. His death occurred just before the surrender of General Lee, the news of which he was anxious to hear. Relincjuishing a good position, in July, 1863, Mr. Robinson enlisted, and was enrolled in the United States navy and credited to the cpiota of New Hampshire.

Before her marriage Mrs. Robinson had made jackets for the State militia in AA'orcester, and she continued to work for the soldiers through- out the war. She had many kinsmen and friends in the army, to whom she frequently sent letters and supplies. She was an eye- witness of the departure of numerous com})anies and regiments, as they passed through Worces- ter, and a frequent visitor at Camp Lincoln and Camp Scott in that city. "These scenes," she says, " are vivid in my mind and will never be erased."

When the Grand Army of the Republic began its beneficent work, Mrs. Robinson renewed her efforts for the veteran, in whose welfare she had never ceased to take an interest. She was a charter member of Relief Corps No. 11, auxil- iary to George H. Ward Post, No. 10. The Hon. Alfred S.

" From the beginning Mrs. Angle Adele Rob- inson has been one of the most enthusiastic and efficient workers in the Relief Corps of AVorces- ter. Seeing her brother go into the service as a member of the Fourth New Hampshire In- fantry, and herself wedded in 1861 to William Lyman Robinson, who did his patriotic duty in the navy in those troublous days, it was very natural that her very being should be bound up in the progress and issue of the struggle. It was her fortune as a girl to help make jackets worn l)v the Massachusetts militiamen in their
