seemed, Dr. Merritt, if we can judge by the good accomplished and the amount of her un- selfish labor for the benefit of others, had roundetl out a long life.

MARGARET HAMILTON, past presi- dent of the National Army Nurse Association, is one of the heroines of the Civil War whose recoril deserves a place in its history. Her experi- ence as an army nurse was in her early woman- hood, when she bore her maiden name, Mar- garet Mahoney. She was marrietl in Phila- delphia in November, 1864, to Charles Roberts Hamilton, a soldier of the Nineteenth Maine A'olunteers, whom she had first met while she was on duty in the Satterlee Hospital.

Born October 19, 1840, in Rochester, N.Y., Mrs. Hamilton is the only chikl of the late Cornelius and Mary (Sheehan) Mahoney. Her paternal grandparents were Dennis Ma- honey and his wife Margaret, for whom she was named. 'She was educated in the public schools and St. Joseph's Seminary at Ennnits- burg, Md. Here she joined the order of Sis- ters of Charity, going through the novitiate, and was sent by them to teach at St. Joseph's Asylum at Albany, N.Y., where she remained for a year and a half. She was with the sis- ters four years; but, before it was time to take the vows (which is done in the fifth year), she found that she hail no vocation for that life, and left the order, but with respect for it and the best of feeling for those with whom she had been associateil.

Early in the spring of 1862 an ortler came from the Mother House for three other nurses ami herself to go to the Satterlee United States Military Hospital in West Philadelphia. Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, the Arctic explorer, was the surgeon in charge, being assistetl by Dr. James Williams, Dr. John S. Billings, and others. The hospital was built to accommodate five thousand patients, and was opened May 1, 1862.

Referring to her experiences, Mrs. Hamilton says: "We fared poorly for some time, as the commissary department had not been estab- lished nor the necessary conveniences for work supplied. A day or two later hundreds of

our brave boys arrived from the Chickahoni- iny swamps. The ward surgeons, metUcal cadets, and the commissary department arrived with them. Now the real work of hospital life began in earnest. The first week after the arrival of these wounded and fever-stricken boys we had scarcely time to eat, rest, or sleep. During the battles that followed in 1S62, 1863, and 1864 our hospital was constantly filled. From the battle-field of Gettysburg more soldiers were received than ever before. The wards were overcrowded, and tents were erected on the grounds to accommodate two thousand. The most of these were colored troops, who, when convalescent, made it lively with camp-meeting hymns, which greatly amused some of the boys. The weather was extremely warm, and the vast number of the wounded made careful attention to their wounds impossible. Upon the arrival of the men at the hospital many of the wounds were full of vermin, and in numerous cases gangrene had set in. The odor was almost unbearable. So increased was ' the demand on our time and labor that the number of nurses seemed utterly inadequate, and the hospital presented a true picture of the horrors of war. Amid such scenes of dreadful suffer- ing, borne so uncomplainingly, my life as an army nunse was passed. Yet it is with feelings of thankfulness to God that I recall those times, and know that I was permitted to give almost three years of the best of my life to the country I love and to its brave defenders."
