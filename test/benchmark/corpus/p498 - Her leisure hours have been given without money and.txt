Her leisure hours have been given without money and without jirice to aid others, and she has always been ready to share with the needy from her limited income. She is frequently seen about Boston streets on her errands of mercy, carrying parcels of clothing for some ])oor woman or child in need.

roll. She conducted all the work of the corps in an able manner, and endeared herself to the members by her courtesy, her unselfish spirit, and devotion to the cause. Although higher honors have been conferred upon her by the State Department, she still continues her work for the Ideal corps, serving on committees, aid- ing in Grand Army fairs and in all ways ]ios- sibie for the welfare of the cause.

Fletcher Webster Post sincerely ai)preciates her efforts in its belialf. As a Department Aide on the staff of the Department President of Massachusetts for several years, she officially visited others corps in the State, serving as in- spector, installing officer, and in various capac- ities. As a delegate to national conventions she has travelled extensively in the South and West, and was a participant in the late conven- tion at San Francisco, as delegate at large from Massachusetts. At two successive State con- ventions she was elected a m 'mber of the De- ))artment Executive Board, and in 1S92 was appointed De]iartment Inspector. The exact- ing duties of this position, wliich required a thorough knowledge of the work, she ]ierformed in a jileasing manner.

In the conclusion of her report to the conven- tion held in Boston she .sunmiarized her official work of the year as follows: " I have attenfled ail council meetings; was present at sixteen social or county tlays; attended sixteen exem- plifications; instructed four corps; inspected nineteen corps; was also present as a guest at the inspection of eight corjis; have attended twenty-seven receptions and other social gath- erings; installed ten corps; have written six hundred and nineteen letters and postals; have visited in all sixty-six different corps at their regular meeting; have repr(&gt;sented the Depart- ment at three county days, also served as dele- gate at national convention held in Washington, and performed such otiier (hities as pertained to my work. For the invitations that I was unable to accept owing to official work I tender my sincere thanks. To the assistant inspectors who have served the Department so faithfully I also express warmest thanks. To the many who not only gave their time and strength to the work but contributed their expenses I am deeply grateful. The many kind letters re-

ceived front them will always be treasured as pleasant memories of our year's work together, and the friendships formed during the year will, I trust, never be broken."

In 1908 Mrs. Goddard was appointed a Na- tional Aide by Mrs. Lodusky J. Taylor, of Min- nesota, National Presid(&gt;nt.

At the convention held in Boston last February she was elected Department Junior Vice-President.
