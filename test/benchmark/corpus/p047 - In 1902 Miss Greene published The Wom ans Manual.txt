In 1902 Miss Greene published "The Wom- an's Manual of Law," a clear, simple, and non- technical book of reference for women who de- sire to inform themselves as to the laws of busi- ness and of the domestic relations. It is said to be the most satisfactory work of the kind yet published. The Chicago Legal News of iSTovember 8, 1902, says of it: â€”

"This book is the result of years of experi- ence of Miss Greene, a member of the Boston bar, as lecturer upon the subject of which it treats. . . . The entire cycle of a woman's life, from her marriage to the grave, is passed in review in successive chapters. First, the laws affecting the domestic relations are considered. Then folloAV those dealing with buying and selling and the care of all kinds of property. In every case the particular legal restrictions upon the powers of the woman who is married are considered. Lastly, the proper disposi- tion of property by will and by the laws of inheritance is treated, inckuUng the rights of the widow or the widower in the property of either.

"Miss Greene has shown good judgment, not only in the .selection of her subjects treated, but in her manner of treating them. Her style is ))Ieasing and easily understood. Every woman who can read the English language, and wishes to know her legal rights, should

have this manual of Miss Greene's for a com- panion. The gifted author tells us, while all the laws discussed in this volume are of equal importance to men, it is entitled 'The Wom- an's Manual of Law' because it is a selection of laws that women especially need to know."

Since 1898 Miss Greene has been a vice- president of the Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society. This organization includes the New England and Middle States, also Dela- ware and the District of Columbia. It is in- corporated under the laws of Massachusetts, and has its ofhce in Tremont Temple, Boston. It is auxiliary to the American Baptist Mis- sionary Union, ami maintains over four hun- dred schools, with about sixteen thou.sand jiupils in Burma, South hulia, China, Japan, and Africa. It supports seventy-three lady missionaries, and carries on medical work, as well as evangelistic and etlucational. In January, 1902, she was, by formal vote of the Board of Directors, matle its authorized legal adviser. Since 1895 she has been president of the Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society of Rhoile Island, a State branch of the general society.

In 1892, at the request of the Board of Man- agers of the Columbian Kx|)osition, she com- piled a pamphlet entitled " Legal Status of Women under the Laws of Rhode Island, 1892." It was originally publishetl in the Rhode Island Woman's Directory for the Co- lumbian Year, edited by Charlotte Field Dailey, and published in Providence in 1893 by the Rhode Island Woman's World's Fair Advisory Board, of which Miss Greene was a member. In 1900, the laws having been very much al- tered and amended, she revised the pamphlet, and it was published by the Rhode Island State Federation of Women's Clubs under the title, "Legal Status of Women in Rhode Islanil, 1900," with a preface concerning the recent sweeping legislation for the benefit of Rhode Island wives.
