During the fifteen years' existence of the Ramabai Association it has had but three presi- dents, the Rev. Dr. Edward E. Hale, the Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott, the Rev. Dr. E. Winchester Donald. Among its officers have been some of the most prominent professional and business

men and philanthropic and generous women of Boston. The reputation of this work and the interest in it are world-wide.

CHARLOTTE J. THOMAS may here be introduced as one who showed at an early age that she dared stand alone. From the time she became mistress of speech she has talked with decision and originality, neither quoting nor leaning upon the opinions of others. She has framed thought and utterance for herself with ex- traordinary spirit and vigor.

Miss Thomas's mother was a woman pos- sessing much force of character and a disposi- tion of great sweetness. She impressed upon her children's minds, while th^y were very young, that this "earth's unfortunates had a human claim upon them." She was connected with " the underground railway of the old slavery days," and many a fugitive from the South has had reason to bless her name. The daughter early became her mother's assistant and confidante, antl all her life has aided the sick and suffering, the ambitious and the poor. Though her name has been associated with various organizations, the greater amount of her charitable work has been individual and unmentioned. The home of Miss Thomas is a noted one in Portland. "The Social Corner," as one of the family friends named it with so much truth, has become a familiar woril, and stands for hospitality, music, originality, and good cheer. Guests of all classes are made welcome in this home with the fine courtesy which brings instant comfort. Entertainment is never offered in stereotyped form, but free- dom of speech, quaint stories, and suddenly suggested plans give all the happy hours a tinge of surprise and novelty. It has been said of the historic Thomas mansion: "Notable people go there, but many others are invited. Not rank, but true manhood, true womanhood, the trying to do good in the spirit of brotherhootl, is the passport to that house." In Old Home W^eek during the summer of 1900 Miss Thomas had her house decorated with flags and pict- ures, and inscribed with the word "Welcome" and the year in which it was built, 1800. Late

in the afternoon an elderly man presented him- self at the door, saying he had seen the legend "Welcome," and, as he was a builder himself, he would like to examine a house constructed at the date indicated, whereupon Miss Thomas assured him that the word was no hollow mock- ery, and cordially invited him to join her fam- ily at the supper table.

The Beecher Club, the first evolution club in Maine, was founded at the "Social Corner." Miss A. M. Beecher, cousin of the noted preacher, Henry Ward Beecher, on one of her visits to Miss Thomas gave a course of familiar talks on science and philanthroj^y. At the close of the visit, through Miss Thomas's influence the club was ff)rme(l, and named in honor of Miss Beecher. The spirit of the home — strength and incUviduality — has remained with the club, and proved a power for good. The originator tells an anuising story concerning her efforts in making up the membership. Approaching a lady on the subject and explaining the char- acter of the study to be undertaken, the lis- tener lifted her hands in dismay and said re- proachfully, "Why, Miss Thomas, I thought you believed in God!"
