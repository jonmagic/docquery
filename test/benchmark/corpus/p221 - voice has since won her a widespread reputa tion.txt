voice, has since won her a wide-spread reputa- tion, her readings being in demand in various parts of the country.

In 1889 Jessie Eldridge married Henry Law- rence Southwick, a graduate of the college, then teaching in Philadelphia. Mr. Southwick be- came the following year a partner of Dr. C. W. Emerson in th" Fm^rson Cr^'lo^e, nnd remained there until 1897, Mrs. Southwick, as one of the faculty, having charge of the classes in voice culture, dramatic interpretation, and the ren- dering of Shakespeare. Mr. and Mrs. South- wick have conducted summer schools at Glens Falls, N.Y., Cottage City, Martha's Vineyard, and at several places in Virginia, as well as in Boston.

In June, 1900, Dean Southwick purchased Dr. Emerson's share in the college and took the full management, Dr. Emerson remaining as President and lecturer in his individual work. Since assuming the management Dean Southwick has made many changes and adtled numerous courses. The Emerson College of Oratory stands to-day as the largest institution of its kind in the world. Established in 1880 as a private school by Charles Wesley Emerson, in September, 1886, it was formally incorpo- rated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the Monroe College of Ora- tory, being named in honor of the late Professor Lewis B. Monroe. LIpon petition to the Legis- lature in 1890, a bill was passed authorizing the change of name to Emerson College of Ora- tory.

This college is a school for personal culture. It aims to awaken in the student of expression, whether he be a creative thinker or an inter- preter, a realization of his own potentialities, and to give such direction to his training that he may attain them. While conserving the best traditions of the past, the college aims to stand for thorough investigation, the mo^t ad- vanced educational methods, and the highest professional standards and ideals.

In 1900 the college was moved into elegant (juarters at Chickering Hall, one of the hand- somest and best appointed of Boston's new buildings. Situated on Huntington Avenue near the corner of Massachusetts Avenue, it is easily accessible from all railroads leading into

the city, and cars to all points pass close to its doors. Within five minutes' walk of the Fens, within eight minutes of the Public Library ancl the Museum of Fine Arts, and close beside the new Symphony Hall and beautiful new hall of the Horticultural Society, the college home is in the artistic and literary centre of Boston.

Mrs. Southwick has been connected with the college as either pupil or teacher almost since its inception, and to her faithful and efficient work in conjunction with her husband is at- tributed much of its success and growth. As a reader and especially as a Shakespearean ex- ponent, she is well known to literary American audiences as a leading artist. Her dramatic power and personal magnetism hold her audi- ences almost spellbound. The series of recitals given every season under the direction of Dean and Mrs. Southwick have become a marked feature of literary Boston, as is shown by the large audiences in attendance. Mrs. South- wick is also a power in the social element of the college life, where she takes a personal interest in all the receptions given, and comes in contact with all of the pupils of the school.
