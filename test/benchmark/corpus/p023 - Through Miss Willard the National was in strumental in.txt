Through Miss Willard the National was in- strumental in organizing the World's W. C. T. L"., which now includes fifty-eight different countries and five hundred thousand members.

The W. C. T. U. originated the idea of scien- tific temperance instruction in the public schools, and has secured mandatory laws in every State in the Union and ;i federal law governing the District of Columbia, the Territoi'ies, and all Indian and military schools supported by the government. Under these laws twenty mill- ion in the public schools receive instruction as to the nature and effects of alcohol and to- bacco and other narcotics on the human sys- tem. Sixteen million children receive tem- perance teaching in the Sunday-schools, and two hundred and ninety-six thousand nine hundred and sixty-four of these are pledged total abstainers. The W. C. T. U. was an im- portant factor in securing the insertion of the quarterly temperance lesson in the Interna- tional Sunday-school Lesson Series, 1884, and in securing a world's universal temperance Sun- day. Two hundred and fifty thousand children are taught scientific reasons for temperance in the Loyal Temperance Legions, and all these children are pledged to total abstinence and trained as temperance workers. The educa- tional value of the W. C. T. U. to its own mem-

bers through courses of study and practical work is immense. Before any other temper- ance society had taken up mothers' meetings, the W. C. T. U. had organized in thirty-seven States and Territories, and two thousand meet- ings were held in Illinois in one year. W. C. T. U. schools of methods are held in all Chau- taucjua gatherings. Indiana held a W. C. T. U. school (jf methods in every one of its counties in 1900.

The W. C. T. U. has largely influenced the change in public sentiment in regard to social drinking, equal suffrage, equal purity for both sexes, equal remuneration for work equally well done, equal educational, professional, and industrial opportunities for men and women. Through its efforts thousands of girls have been rescued from lives of shame, and tens of thou- sands of men have signed the total abstinence pledge and been redeemed from inebriety.

The several States tlistributed nine million four hunilred and forty-four thousand three hundred and fifty pages. The National W. C. T. U. printed and distributed in 1901 fifty-five thousand annual leaflets of sixty-six pages each, which, with its annual reports and other literature given away, amounts to over five million pages.

The Union Siynol, the official organ for the National and World's W. C. T. U., a sixteen- page weekly, has a large circulation. The Cru- mdcr, a sixteen-page monthly, the official organ of the Loyal Temperance Legion, has a large and increasing circulation. One thousand colunms are filled weekly in other newspapers by two thousand eight hundred and sixteen superintendents. Thirty-two States publish State papers devote&lt;l entirely to W. G. T. U. interests.

The W. C. T. U. has been the chief factor in State campaigns for statutory prohibition, con- stitutional amendments, reform laws in gen- eral, and those for the protection of women and children in particular, and in securing anti- gambling and anti-cigarette laws. It has been instrumental in raising the age of protection for girls in every State but two. The age is now eighteen years in thirteen States, sixteen years in nineteen States, and from twelve to fifteen years in the other States. Through its
