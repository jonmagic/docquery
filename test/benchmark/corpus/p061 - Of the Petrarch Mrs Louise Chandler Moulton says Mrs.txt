Of the "Petrarch" Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton says: "Mrs. Ward has done her work admirably; and from this one book you may glean all that is of real value in the hundreds of volumes of which Petrarch has been the theme. His love, his friendship, his ambi- tions, his greatness, and his follies, . . . they are written here."

No less an expert than John Fi.ske thus pro- nounced upon the merits of "Old Colony Days": "The sympathy and breadth of treatment make it a charming series of essays." One of the

best of the appreciations of the book is that of the Chicago Times-Herald: "Plain history in fascinating guise is so rare a gift to the per- functory seeker for knowledge that attention must be called to a charming new book, 'Old Colony Days,' written in the sprightliest of easy styles for young or old, and displaying the high lights of the history of the New Eng- land colonies. It is not that the story is new: it as old as love to Puritans and their descend- ants. It is on account of a crisp, brisk, and ringing style, and on account of the taste with which the historian discriminates in subject matter, that we like the book so well. The half-satirical, half-serious manner in which all our ancestral worthies are memorized is indeed attractive. There are never too many words, there is always a simple style, and there are invariably points of interest lighted upon."

Mrs. Ward's latest book, "Prophets of the Nineteenth Century," is in a sense her most important one, and into it she has put more of her own personality. The "Prophets," Car- lyle, Ruskin, Tolstoi, stand for humanity. We are sure that the expression of their convictions in the book voices Mrs. W^ard's own feelings; that their theories of life have largely influ- enced her own; that she herself is not only in sympathy with the great movement which her prefatory note says is sweeping over the world, but is a part of it, as her connection with the clubs gives her the opportunity and the right to be. "The Prophets of the Nineteenth Cen- tury" has received warm endorsement. Caro- line H. Dall, in the Springfield Republican, thus commends it: "The sketches of Carlyle and Ruskin are masterly. They seize the essential points with a true comprehensipn, ant^ neither the two volumes of Froude nor any that con- cerns Ruskin give as clear an idea of the men they celebrate." Several of Mrs. ^\'ard's books have already been translated into other lan- guages, amongthem being the "Prophets", which has made its appearance in Japanese.

It will be seen that Mrs. Ward's work gives her a right to distinction. Yet the woman behind it is more than any expression of herself in her writings and lectures. The sketch of her written by Kate Sanborn for a Boston paper a few years ago is so exact a portrait

that one does not like either to add to or take away from the picture. Miss Sanborn says: "Mrs. Ward possesses a simphcity of manner that comes only with sinc(&gt;rity of purpose, the best breeding, and a hacking of desirable an- cestry; an executive ability that is never marred by its too frecjuent accompanimentâ€” a domi- neering spirit and a desire for control; a straight, clear outlook from eyes that hide no secrets, a hand-grasp that is cordial, without being effusive. One is impressed by the apparent ease with which she accomplishes great tasks. She does not talk of her work, nor take herself too seriously, and is delightfully free from ped- antry. What she has done for other women, spiring a scholarly si)irit, giving history and
