Miss Greene was the first woman contributor to the American Laic Revieiv. Some of the published articles are: "Privileged Communi- cations in Suits between Hu.sband and Wife," American Law ^ Review, September-October, 1890; "The Evolution of the American Fee

Simple," American Law Review, March-April, 1897: "Results of the Woman Suffrage Move- ment," Forum, June, 1894; and a series of arti- cles on law for women in the Chautauquan, No- vember, 1891-August, 1892.

Her translation entitled "The Woman Law- yer," from the French of Dr. Louis Frank, the famous Belgian champion of woman's rights ("La Fenime-Avocat," par L. Frank, Bruxelles, 1888), appeareil serially in the Chicago Law Times for the year 1889. Dr. Frank dedicated to Miss Greene his Catechisme de la Femme in 1895. This little work was translated into nearly every language of Continental Europe, with its dedication.

Miss Greene's address at the World's Con- gress of Jiu'isprudence upon "Married Wom- an's Projjerty Acts' in the LTnited States, and Needetl Reforms therein," was published in the Chicago Legal A'cu's of August 12, 1893. Her address delivered in the Woman's Build- ing of the Columbian Exposition, entitled "Legal Condition of Women in 1492 and 1892," is printed in full in the official volumes of the Congresses in the Woman's Building. In the New Englnnd Magazine for 1898 is her illu.s- trateil article on General Nathanael Greene, a brief biography tracing the development of General Cireene's character ami attempting to show what it was that made him a great mili- tary genius.

The Woman's Baptist Foreign Missionary Society has published two small pamphlets from her penâ€” "The Primer of Missions" in 1896 and "Women's Missionary Wills and Bonds" in 1902. Miss Greene says, "If I get interested in any subject, legal, patriotic, or missionary, I have to deliver addresses and publish articles about it." She is a magnetic speaker, anil has the power to hold her audi- ences and to inspire them with enthusiasm.

At the Fortieth Anniversary of the first Woman's Rights Convention she repre.sented women in the legal profession. The meeting, presided over by Lucy Stone, was held in Trem- ont Temple, January 27, 1891, and Miss Greene, though her voice is naturally low, as she spoke on "Women in the Law," made three thousand people hear with ease.

.As a presiding officer she is unusually popu-

lar and successful. In her own words, "I suj)- pose it is because I have such complete self- possession myself that my audience feel easy and comfortable themselves." She was State Regent for Rhode Island of the Daughters of the American Revolution from 1895 to 1897, and is now an Honorary State Regent.

Miss Greene says: "I did not intend to delay for so many years my application for admis- sion to the bar of Rhode Island. No woman has yet applied here. By the rules of court a member of the bar of another State may appear here and plead, but all court papers must be signed by a member of the Rhode Island bar. As I do not practise in court, there has been no need for me to apply, and I have put it off from time to time for a more convenient season. I am not an 'agitator' of any sort, and do not care to do anything merely for the sake of the notoriety of doing it. I am glad to help where I can to make the world better by informing the people of pres- ent conditions, pointing out reforms, and help- ing others to do the reforming if I can."
