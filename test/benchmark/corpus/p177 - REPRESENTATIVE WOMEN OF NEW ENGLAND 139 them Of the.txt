them. Of the sons, Cyrus and Darius first en- listed; and the mother displayed her Spartan spirit from this time throughout the war. She was present as a leader in the meetings of mothers and sisters anil others, held so often in Boston for prayer for the loved volunteers fighting at the front. Her disinterested patri- otism was the more marked inasmuch as the twins were the only sons left her at home, the others being married. She was a welcome vis- itor to Readville Camp, always responding to the request of the twins' comrades to address them, in which the father joined when he visited the camp with her. On account of her fervor at the prayer meetings it was anticipated that there would be a somewhat dramatic scene when the Forty-fourth Regiment should be received by their friends on Boston Common on their return, but the anticipatetl scene was not enacted. Mother and sons met with marked calmness. The same calmness that had at- tended the departure for possible death in battle received the safe return.

Fortitude was a prime virtue. It attended her through life, and appeared with a kind of solemn grandeur on the approach of death. Having had two strokes of paralysis, she awaited the third stroke with tran([uillity. She calmly arranged with her twin sons for her funeral, going into all details with them as if it were an ordinary, every-day matter. She recjuested them to sing at her grave, which they promised to do if they were able. They then knelt at her feet, and she placed her hands upon their heads and blessed them. They feel those hands upon their bowed heails to this day, and listen to the dying mother's blessing uttered in that same firm, fervid tone which had so often been an inspiration and a comfort.

Her last hours were spent in a pleasant chamber, that overlooked Mystic River and Bunker Hill Monument. On a beautiful morn- ing. May 2, 1880, while the Sabbath bells were ringing, she realized that the last summons had come. She asked her grandson, Albert Wins- low, who was alone with her, to help her to a large arm-chair awaiting her in the chamber. Her mother and grandmother had died in this chair, and she had always desired to die in it.

When she was in the chair, she made a sign

for her grandson to take her hand. "Help qie over, don't hold me back," she said with tran- quil happiness. Her son George Winslow and his wife and daughter appeared, having been warned by Albert. Heaving struggles for breath ensued. "Excuse me for making this noise," she gasped. "I cannot help it." Thus did she show to the last that tender regard for the feelings of others which had ever charac- terized her â€” an ever-attendant virtue.

The funeral services were held in the l^niver- salist church at East Boston, and were attended by the Ladies' Physiological Institute in a body. According to her dying request, the funeral sermon was delivered by the Rev. Dr. A. St. John Chambrc, whom she loved as a son.
