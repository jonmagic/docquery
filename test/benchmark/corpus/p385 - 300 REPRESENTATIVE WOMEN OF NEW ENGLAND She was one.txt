REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

She was one of the founders and for many years vice-president of the Moral Education Association, one of whose aims was to create an interest in tlie subject of physiological in- struction in the high schools. She presided over a meeting held in one of the halls of Bos- ton, in which the subject was discussed by a goodly number of earnest, thoughtful men and women, wlio had come to realize its need. It was a great .satisfaction to her, near the close of her life, to know that the movement had gained steadily in favor, nmch having been done to advance the cause, especially in pro- viding suitable literature and giving lectures.

When the Hospital Board of the Woman's Charity Club was ff)rmed, she became an ac- tive member, always ready to give from her experience thoughts and suggestions of value in this new field of woman's work.

In 188!) she was the originator of the idea that led to the institution of the Connnittee of Counsel and Co-operation, composed of dele- gates from many large organizations. Of this "C. C. C." she was chairman, and planned several of the reforms which it brought about. Some of tlie beneficial results of their labors are the reform in the management of the public institutions of ]3oston and the appointment of .women on prison and charitable boards. They have worked for shorter hours in mercantile establishments and for other measures in behalf of working-women. Along the line of moral reform they have made persistent and success- ful efforts. They were also instrumental in checking the practice of spitting in the public cars, which by the Board of Health is now made punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars. For several years their attention has been given to the subject of pui)lic anuisements, effecting the removal of several obscene and demoralizing exhibits. This, watchfulness is a healthy restraint on the managers of these places, and has effected a decided improve- ment in the character of the displays.

As president of the Ladies' Physiological In- stitute her work was broad and fur-reaching. She strove to eliminate from her teaching all obscure technicalities and make her lectures plain, practical, and so interesting as to hold the attention of the members who came each

week from far ami near. She was leader, in- structor, fellow-worker, and personal friend; and many are the mothers whose children reap the benefit of her wise teachings.

She was also prominent in the movement in- augurated by Mrs. Alice N. Lincoln for a re- form in the public institutions of Boston, which resulted in the appointment in 1892, by Mayor Matthews, of a Board of Visitors, "to be," as he wisely expressed it, "eyes and ears for him." Hearings Aveie held before the Conmiittee on Public Institutions, and few who listened to hei' will ever forget Dr. Merritt's eloquent plea in behalf of this measure. Another Board of ^^isitors was iijipointed in 1894. After further hearings a committee of three, of which Dr. Mcrritt was one, )3rescnted a bill, endorsed by Mayor Quincy, asking that the public institu- tions of Boston be divided, and that separate departments be established for the care ot prisoners, paupers, children, antl insane per- sons. Each dcjiartment was to have a Board of Trustees, composed of lioth men and women. /This measure became a law in 1897, after a bitter contest. In this work, from its incipiency to the enactment of the law. Dr. Merritt was instrumental in enlisting public sentiment and assistance.
