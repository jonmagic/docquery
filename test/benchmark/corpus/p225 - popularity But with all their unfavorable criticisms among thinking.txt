popularity. But with all their unfavorable criticisms, among thinking students she soon commanded the highest respect. In 1886 Miss Cooke was made preceptress of the college and in 1872 professor of German and history, the latter appointment being, it is said, the first honor of the kind conferred upon a woman in the I'nitcd States. These departments of the college she built up and establishetl on a firm foundation. In 1886 she was re- lieved of the German and made professor of history anil the science of government. Granted leave of absence in 1872, she spent the year in Great Britain and on the Continent, avail- ing herself of the advantages given by the London University for the study of history and literature, also increasing her knowledge of the German language by the assistance of native teachers. She continued her work at Coi'iiell College until 1890.

This brief account of the educational career of Professor Harriette J. Cooke, together with the following appreciation of her work and character, is gathered from a sketch written for the College Year Book' for 1890 by a former pupil and lifelong friend, namely, Mrs. Collin, wife of Alonzo Collin, the senior professor of Cornell College.

Miss Cooke has given special attention to the moral and religious training of the hvmdreds of young ladies who have been placed under her immediate charge. Many of them testify that her strong appeals to the noblest powers of their being were among their chief incen- tives in trying to develop themselves into the highest types of true womanhood. She had a realizing sense of the great responsibility resting upon her, a feeling that none can know but those who have consecrated them- selves to lives of self-sacrifice for the good of others. Possessed of an active mind and a physical organization that seems never to have known weariness, she has endured un- ceasing toil for years, having in all her college life lost but one term, and this because of a serious injury occasioned by a fall. With a spirit of unselfishness and a great capacity to endure, she has generally done the work of two.

Miss Cooke is a very pleasing public speaker,

having frequently used her talents in this direction for the benefit of her college and other philanthropic objects. She is a strong, terse writer, with an interesting style, as is often shown by class lectures and papers read before literary and other organizations. She has been a zealous student and a constant and .successful teacher of the Bible. This inspired volume has given her much of the wonderful faith, hope, and love she has in and for humanity. She is well informed on the affairs of state and the science of business relations. In the sick-room she has shown herself unusually skilful as a nurse. Fortunate are they who have her name upon tlieir list of friends. Fearless and faithful, she will be to them loyal and true, cheerful and kind. Soon after leaving Cornell College, Miss Cooke went to England for the purpose of studying Christian work as carried on by Mildmay in North London. This great mission was the first attempt on a large scale to carry on reformatory work in the slums of a great city by workers living among the crowded population. During the winter of 1872, when Miss Cooke was making some research in history at University College, London, her attention was attracted to this work, which, by its unusual methods and by the high rank of those engaged in it, excited great interest in the city. Indirectly it \yas the outgrowth of the plague which made such havoc in the congested section of East London during the years 1865-66. It was impossible to care for the dying or to bury the dead, for sometimes whole families were taken sick in one house. At this crisis Mr. and Mrs. Pennefather, with a band of women from the upper class of society, offered to assist the clergyman at Bethnal Green in that centre of the plague. These women, six in number, began their labor of love by opening an old warehouse as a home for themselves and as a centre of distribution of such help as they could give. They pre- pared suitable food, gathered such things as they might need — drugs, disinfectants, clean linen, and so forth — and began their visits to the homes. With nutritious food, comforts of every kind, and words of love they cheered the sick, comforted the dying, read the Bible,
