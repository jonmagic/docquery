" Not on a blind and ainiluss way The spirit goetli,"

and

I know not whure His islands lift Their fronded palms in air;

I only know I cannot drift Beyond His love and care."

Even the newspapers, those that had always opposed equal rights for women, heaped praises upon her; and a lifelf)ng adversary of hers said, "The death of no woman in America has ever called out so widespread a tribute of affection and esteem."

She had not the smallest thirst for fame. It has l)een hard to compile any adequate ac- count of her life, because she kept no record of her work, never cared to preserve her press notices, and refused, almost with horror, all recjuests from publishers of books about "fa- mous women" to furnish material for a bio- graphical sketch of herself. She thought it hardly worth while that any account of her should ever be written. Yet this very fact, while it greatly increases the difficulties of her biographer, is perhaps in itself the strongest testimony to the spirit in which she did her work. During her last illness she took pleas- ure in the following lines, which she had clipped from some newspaper: —

" Up and away like the dew of the morning

That soais fi-oni the earth to its home in the sun, So let me steal away, gently and lovingly, (Jnly remembered by what I have done.

" My name and my place and my tomb all forgotten, The brief race of time well and jiatiently run, •So let me pass away, peacefully, silently. Only remembered by what I have done.

■• Xeeds there the praise of the love-written record, The name and the epitaph graved on the stone ? The things we have lived for, let them be our story; We ourselves but remembered by what we have done."

born in Reading, Mas.s., June 2, 1786, and died December 21, 1822. Her mother, Mrs. Ann Ban- croft Poole, was sister to the Rev. Dr. Aaron Bancroft, father of George Bancroft the his- torian. Deacon Caleb AVakefieUl married, sec- ondly, November 8, 1S23, Nancy Temple, who was born in Reading, October 21, 1794, and died there November 18, 1873. Caleb Wake- field was Captain of the military comi)any; Selectman, 1830-40; Representative, 1833-36; Justice of the Peace, 1845-51 and in 1865: and was chosen Deacon of the Okl South Church, Reading, August 23, 1821. A man of inde- pendent thought, persistent in his positions when once taken, he was pn^gressive, ready to receive information, and endowed with strong moral force. His firmness of attitude on most questions was due to the care with which he had formed his opinions; once convinced of their error, no man knew better how to give up or when to drop the old and take on the new. It is said that probably for fifty years no one man did more than he to shape the in- terests of the connnunity and aid and lead in the financial, educational, moral, and religious growth of the town. A good neighbor, wise in counsel, he was often called to be the adviser of orphans, young men, and widows; and as the executor of sacred trusts he often stood between the living and the dead, well earning the affectionate remembrance in which his name is held.
