In September, 1902, MLss Thomas married George Lyman Cade, of Cambridge, Mass. After residing for some time in Boston, Mr. and Mrs. Caile removed to their present home in Melrose. They have one child, a daughter, Margaret Salome, who was born in Melrose, October 28, 1903.

Mrs. Cade is a member of the Protestant Epis- copal church. She belongs to Paul .Jones C'hap- ter, D. A. R., and was for many years a mem- ber of the Cecilia Club of Boston.

Graceful, almost girlish in figure, of gracious and unassuming manners, she is a woman of delightful personality and an interesting con- versationalist.

Mrs. Cade has recently been giving the Jap- anese Love Song and dance in native C(jstume in Boston, receiving marked commendation from musical critics. In November next, 1904, she is to appear in London in a series of con-

certs and recitals under the management of Messrs. Boosey &amp; Co., introducing her own songs.

ALICE E. WELD WHITAKER, first

/ \ president of the Boston Woman's Press X .^ Club (organized in February, 1903), was born at Southbridge, Mass., m November, 1851, being a daughter of Charles Winthrop and Lucinda (Richardson) Weld. She is a direct descendant of Captain Joseph Weld, who figured prominently in the early history of Roxbury. She also traces her an- cestry along other lines to early settlers of Boston. Mrs. W^hitaker early manifested a liking for domestic science, both practical and theoretical, and also for newspaper work. Opportunities enabled her to gratify and develop her natural tastes. Her life work has been therefore along these dual lines, which have admirably supplemented and assisted each other, strength and experience gained in one having increased her ability and usefulness m the other. In this way she has become well known as a newspapei' worker and a rec- ognized authority on much that relates to domestic life, from cooking and sanitation to the artistic use of the needle and brush. Her early education included the regular courses at the high school in her native town and at Nichols Academy, Dudley.

Mrs. Whitaker's newspaper work began soon after her marriage to George M. Whitaker, A.M., in 1872. For sixteen years she edited a page of the Southbridge Journal, devoted to women's interests. This department was conducted with such ability that it soon won more than a local reputation, and gave the Journal a standing as mon; than a mere pur- veyor of town items. For a year she was the sole editor of the paper.

In 1886 Mrs. Whitaker removed to Boston and took a prominent position on the New England Farmer, of which she edited a page devoted to women's interests until July, 1903. This was a strong feature of the paper, and added much to its popularity. Her editorials were frequently quoted in other publications. In addition to this teclmical writing and edit-

ing she did considerable all-round work on the Neiv England Farmer, at times being responsi- ble for the editing of the whole pajier. Further than this, she has done much work for other publications. For two years she edited the Health Magazine, which was a marked success under her management. For several years she has written a daily article on cookery for a syndicate of daily papers; for a portion of the tune this was illustrated. She has also done much miscellaneous literary work, and has been a frequent contributor to various other period- icals.
