the Senate and House of Rej^resentatives of the United. States of America in Congress as- sembled,

"That the Secretary of the Interior be and is hereby authorized to grant to John A. Fowle and Elida B. Rum.sey the use of a portion of the land owned by the United States and known as 'Judiciary Square,' to erect thereon, free from charge to the Ignited States, a suitable building for a soldiers' free library and reading- room for .soldiers; provided that the same can be done without prejudice to the public inter- ests, and provided that the expenses shall be borne by said Fowle and Rumsey, and that all benefits and privileges of such library and reading-room be granted to our soldiers free of charge, and that said building be removed whenever the Secretary of the Interior shall require the same to be done.

"Approved January 13, 1863."

Mr. Fowle and Miss Rumsey continued their concerts, the proceeds of which, with one hun- dred dollars contributed l)y Mrs. Walter Baker and sums from other friends, enabled them to erect the builtling. It contained a libiary room, a room for hospital stores, and a reading-room, and was dedicated Sunday evening, March 1, with aiipropriate ceremonies. A circular ap- pealing for funds and books received a generous response. The first books were received from four little girls in Dorchester, Ma,ss. Mrs. \\'alter Baker sent eight hundred volumes, and through the efforts of other friends, together with receipts from concerts, six thousand vol- umes of good reading matter were in the library before the close of the war. Miss Rumsej' served as librarian for a while, but later con- valescents from the hospitals were detailed for this position.

Miss Rumsey's daily journal of March, 1863, gives information of interest: "Number of bortks about five thousand, all covered, num- bered and catalogued. Reading-room opened daily from 9 a.m. State papers kept on file. The decorations of the hall the donations of soldiers' friends at the North. Writing pajjci-, ])en, and ink always to be found on tahles for u.se of soldiers. On an average fifty letters sent to the i)ost-office daily.

ing Sunday afternoons. Room accommodates about four hundred with comfortable settees. Soldiers take an active part. Citizens, too, attend these meetings, and the citizens cheer the soldiers. Tuesday evenings a soldiers' con- cert, the room always crowded. The use of the building free to all soldiers, State associa- tions, and all benevolent objects. The privi- lege of fifty volumes or more is offered to the chaplain and friends, to be distributed in hospi- tals out of the city, to be returned or exchanged for others within two weeks.

"The store-room in the building always con- tains a goodly supply of articles suitable for the soldiers' use, and is often replenished by the noble women of the North."

A soldiers' church was formed, having about two hundred members, of all denominations; and to each soldier member of the little free library church was given a small certificate, having a picture of the library and bearing the name of the soldier, his company and regi- ment, the State where he lived, ancl these three simple articles: "(1) I will try to the best of my ability to be a Christian. (2) I will take the Word of God for my guide and trust in Christ alone for salvation. (3) I solenmly pledge myself to abstain from profane language, from alcoholic drinks as a beverage, and from all vices of the army and camp, and will be a true soldier of my country and the cross." This certificate was signed by Mr. Fowle and Miss Rumsey, with date. More than one sol- dier boy was identified on the battle-fields by this little certificate, found in his pocket.
