in the spring of 1869, chose Athol, Mass., as their field for the work of hfe. Hero they have since matle their home, its thatches in- separably interwoven with local history aiul traditions. For some time after the removal to Athol, Mrs. Hamilton was an invalid, her case a hopeless one, it was thought; but a strong constitution and never wav(&gt;ring covu'- age at length prevailed, and she again entered society after practically a ten years' exile. She was soon in demand in the service of song and in a variety of social activities. Her voice, through occasional service, b(Tame fa- miliar in nearly all the churches of Athol. Mrs. Hamilton and her husband are members of the Congregational church, she having joined the church of that faitli in \A'estminster, \'t., and remaining true, though holding her de- nominational preference subordinate to a broail recognition of the Christ spirit luider whatever name appearing.

Mrs. Hamilton, in the privacy of her home, often recalls the numerous occasions on whicli she has sung in houses of mourning in West- minster, Bernardston, Orange, and Athol, feel- ing that such was perhaps her most helpful service of song.

In 1888, becoming interested in the prin- ciples and aims of the Woman's Relief Corps, she joined Hubbard V. Smith Corps, No. 82, of Athol, and at once entered actively into its work, making it a subject of careful study, but declining rapid preferment, when sug- gested. In 1890 Mrs. Hamilton was assistant guard, in 1891 Senior A'ice-President, in 1892 corps Secretary, and in 1893, 1894, and 1895 corps President, bringing to her duties the qualification of a thorough knowledge of the work, both as to its spirit, ritual, and methods of exemplication. Her natural executive abil- ity, thus put to test, contributed to three years of successful work. The flag salute, introduced in the public schools during that time with flags presented by the corps, has continued a permanent feature in the schools. At Mrs. Hamilton's suggestion, made on oc- casion of her installation as Presitlent in 1895, and aided her by efforts, Corps No. 82 erected to the "Unknown Dead" in Silver Lake Ceme- tery a beautiful granite monument, which was

dedicated at the memorial service. May 30, 1895. The administration of Mrs. Hamilton was characterized by the loyal and enthusi- astic support of the corps and on her part by a desire to rentier impartial recognition and justice to all. After retiring from the presidency she continued with unabated zeal to second the efforts of her successors and in every way to sustain the work of the corps. Mrs. Hamilton was Department Aide, 1894- 1897; Department Instructor and Installing officer in 1898; member of the Dejiart- ment Executive Board in 1899; and in 1900 serving on the Auditing Committee. During her three consecutive years in the Depart- ment Council she was present at every meet- ing, thus gaining broader and deeper views of the merit and magnitude of the W. R. C. work and an appreciation of the noble women under whose guidance it has prospered. This experience she deems abundant compensa- tion for all that she has been able to put into a work that has conmianded a larger share of her time and efforts than all other public or organization work. In 1894 Mrs. Hamilton was a delegate to the National W. R. C. Con- vention in Louisville, Ky., and visited the National W. R. C. Home in Madison, Ohio. In 1902 she was a National Aide and Depart- ment Special Aide. During the emergency work for the soldiers of the war with Spain, Mrs. Hamilton was chairman of the Executive Committee of Corps No. 82, and rendereil ac- tive service. She has also maintained a lively interest in the Sons of \'eterans work, espe- cially in the welfare of the local General W. T. Sherman Camp, which she regards as the lineal heir to the spirit and traditions of Parker and Hubbard V. Smith Posts of the G. A. R. of Athol.
