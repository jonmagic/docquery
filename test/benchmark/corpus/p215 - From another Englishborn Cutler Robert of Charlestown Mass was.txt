From another English-born Cutler, Robert,' of Charlestown, Mass., was descended the Rev. Timothy Cutler, D.D., the first rector of Christ Church, Boston, and "one of the first scholars

of his age in the colonies." Others of this name in America have occupied high rank in the clerical, legal, and medical professions.

An uncle of Mrs. Heald, General Lysander Cutler, had an interesting career. Born in Royalston, Mass., in 1807, he moved to Dex- ter, Me., when a young man, engaged in busi- ness as a woollen manufacturer, and became the most eminent citizen of that place. Later in life he removed to Milwaukee, Wis. En- listing at the breaking out of the Civil War, he was commissionetl Colonel of the Sixth Wis- consin Regiment, served with great honor in the Army of the Potomac, and was afterward promoted to Major-general. He died in 1866.

Mrs. Heald's mother was a lovely character, gentle and conscientious, dispensing words of kindness and the quiet charities which shun publicity. The family home being in Port- land during Mrs. Heald's childhood and youth, she was educated in the city schools. In the year 1870 she married John Sumner Heakl, claim adjuster of the Maine Central Railroad. Mr. Healil is the granilson of the Hon. Mark Langdon Hill, of Phippsburg, Me., one of the early settlers, a prominent and wealthy man in his day. It was in his family barouche that General Lafayette was taken through the streets of Portland when entertained there during his visit to the United States of Amer- ica in 1824-25. Mr. Hill's barouche was the most elegant one at hand, and was loaned to Portland for the occasion.

Always of a deeply religious turn of mind, Mrs. Heald became when very young a mem- ber of the Episcopal church. She has been a student of creeds, autl has plunged into an- cient and modern philosophy. She has stud- ied science, theosophy, and the works of deep thinkers of all ages, not for diversion, but to find truth. Whatever her creed is to-day, her rule of life is most emphatically, "Love thy neighbor." She has the tenderest love and sympathy for children, and has been a willing helper in Sunday-schools. For a number of years she has been active in charitable and club work. It was she who was instrumental in forming the Cumberland Relief Cure, an organization which raised funds to send twenty- five men to the Keely Cure, furnishing and

equipping a reading-room for them. Thougli there were some disappointing features in this labor, one bright particular case is so happy in results that it seems ample reward for all the effort put forth.

Mrs. Heald was for five years the efficient president of the Beecher Club, whose study was evolution; and she has been on the execu- tive board of many of the well-known Portland associations, including the Women's Literary Union. At one time she belonged to fourteen organizations. She is now State president of the Maine division of the International Sun- shine Society, an office that is no sinecure, since she is usually called to write no less than sixty letters a week. Attracted to the Sun- shine columns in. the papers some time ago, she took hold of the \.ork with such grasp that she was .soon appointed its leader in Maine. This .society is " not a charity, Init an inter- change of kindly greetings and the passing on of good cheer." There are about a hundred and fifty daily and weekly papers reporting "Sunshine" news. The society was founded by Mrs. Cynthia Westover Alden in 1896. Its object is to incite its members to the perform- ance of kind and helpful deeds, and to thus bring the sunshine of happiness into the great- est possible number of hearts and homes. Its active membership consists of people who are desirous of brightening life by some thought, word, or deed.
