Mr. White was born at Lancaster, N.H., Feb- ruary 7, 1811, being a son of Samuel and Sarah (Freeman) White and descendant of WilHam White, an early settler of Essex County, Massa- chusetts. For a number of years in his youth he was employed in the Columbian Hotel, Concord, N.H. He started in business for himself in 1832, becoming a part owner in the stage route between Concord and Hanover, later buying the line between Concord and Lowell. He was a young man of more than ordinary ability, upright and honorable, and using neither intoxicants nor tobacco in any form. In 1837, in partnership with Cap- tain William Walker, he established himself in the express business, making tri-weekly trips to Boston. Upon the opening of the Concord Railroad in 1842 he became one of the original members of the express company then organ- ized to deliver goods throughout New Hamp- shire and Canada. He died at his home in Concord, October 2, 1880. In his forty-eight years of business life he had acquired something more than a competency, having become the possessor of valuable realty in Chicago, hotel property in New Hampshire, and stock in vari- ous railroad corporations, banks, manufac- tories, and other companies, in addition to his interests in the express company and in Con- cord real estate.

Mr. W^hite took a deep interest in the estab- lishment of the New Hampshire A.sylum for the Insane, the State Reform School, the Or- phans' Home at Franklin, to which he gave a generous endowment, and of the Home for the Aged at Concord. Always a friend of the op- pressed, he was an active member of the Anti- slavery Society, a stanch helper also of the cause of temperance and other unpopular reform movements, among them that of woman suffrage, his wife earnestly sympathizing and working with him. He was, with his wife, one of the original members of the Universal ist Society in Concord and a constant attendant and liberal supporter of that society.
