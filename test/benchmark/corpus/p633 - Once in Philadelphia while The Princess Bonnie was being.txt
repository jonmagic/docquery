Once in Philadelphia, while "The Princess Bonnie" was being sung, Kitty Clover lost her voice in a most unexpectetl manner, and coukl not sing a note. Miss Quinlan imme- diately grasped the situation, and, although in student costmne, came to the front of the stage, and, placing her arms around the voice- less songstress, sang the solo, transposing the words to give proper meaning to her rendi- tion. Another time, in "Mignon," the prima donna, who sang the part of Filina, did not answer her cue, and after a hurried search could not be found. Miss Quinlan stepped into the gap, singing the lines to perfection, and again saved the evening. This latter act proved to be her emancipation from the chorus.

Miss Quinlan is not a member of any societies or clubs, but a most devoted parishioner of the Roman Catholic church. Her voice has had constant care and cultivation since the day she first entered the chorus. It has been trained under Franklyn Smith, of Boston, Mr. Frederic Bruegger, of Chicago, and Mr. Karl Brenneman, of New York.

CLARA MARCELLE GREENE (Mrs. Wyer Greene), author, a native of the Pine Tree State, residing in Portland, was born in Bucksport, and was there reared and educated, being successively pupil and teacher in the seminary at that place. From childhood she has been a lover of books, and many a student acknowledges a debt of gratitude to her for her wise advice and direc- tion as to their choice of books. She relin- quished the cares of the school-room when she became the wife of a Portland merchant, Mr. Wyer Greene, and has since resided in that city. Mr. and Mrs. Greene have a son and daughter, the latter a fine musician. For a number of years there have appeared in sev- eral magazines stories and verses from Mrs. Greene's pen that show marked talent. A vol- ume of her poems, published a few years ago, was received with favor. Her health, never robust, has, however, at times made literary work impossible for her. Mrs. Greene is a member of some of the literary clubs in Port-

land, and numbers among her acquaintance several prominent New England authors. The poet Whittier spoke favorably of her talent. A Christmas story entitled "The Children," published in Christian Work, 1902, and a serial illustrating the laws governing a wife's dower, which was run in the Portland Transcript several years ago, show with what fine sym- pathy she understands the inner nature of women and children, and with what nicety she depicts their individual traits of character.
