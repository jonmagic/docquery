"His son Samuel graduated from Harvard College in 1684, and went to England soon after, where he took orders in the English

" My paternal grandfather, Joab, and great- grandfather, Daniel, were both soldiers of the Revolution.

[In " Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolutionary War," vol. x., the record of Joab Miles is as follows: "Sergeant, Capt. Wing Spooner's Co., Col. Nathan Sparhawk's regt.; engaged Aug. 21, 1777, travel to camp and home 180 miles; service at twenty miles per day, 9 days; company marched from Petersham to Bennington, Aug. 21, 1777, to reinforce army under General Stark; also, 1st Sergeant, Capt.

To her unselfish de- votion, her gentle and loving admonitions, am I greatly indebted for whatever there may be in me that is conmiendable. My mother was a direct tlescendant of William Curtis, who arrived in Boston on the ship 'Lyon,' September 16, 1632."
