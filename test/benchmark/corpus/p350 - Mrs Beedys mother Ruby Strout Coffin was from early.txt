Mrs. Beedy's mother. Ruby Strout Coffin, was from early girlhood highly religious. Her diary gives a record of her many interest- ing experiences as a teacher, which ])rofe.ssion she adojited at the early age of .seventeen. She describes her long journeys on horseback through the woods to her school. After her marriage Mrs. Coffin became the first president of the Martha Washington Society at Harrington, and in one of her addresses, the paper of which is now j'ellowed with time, we find she advocated the founding of a village library â€” advocated it so pertinently that it was soon in operation, being hou.sed for .some years in the homes of the members, who alternately assumed the obligation.

Mrs. Beedy's early training was of the best. Her mother's i-eligious teaching took deep root in her heart, and her father's coun.sels were for her practical good.

She subsequently took the full Chautauqua course, ami at llad- cliffe College in the year 1897 she took a special course in English composition. She is still a student, and, except when the press of duties forbids, is never long away from her books.

In the Farmington State Normal School she is rememberetl as a conscientious and enthusiastic instructor, one whose personal interest in her pupils extended beyond the walls of the class-room.

The marriage of Miss Helen Coffin and Mr. Daniel Beedy took place in 1875 at Castine, Me. For a number of years Mr. Beedy was one of the more jirominent citizens of Farm- ington, where they made their home, and where since Mr. Beedy's death, in 1889, Mrs. Beedy, when not travelling abroad, has con- tinued to reside.

Mrs. Beedy lias been president of the Frank- lin County W. C'. T. U. ever since its organ- ization. She is an active member of the Methoilist I'^piscopal chui'ch, has been officially connected with the State Suffrage Clul) and the State Federation of Clubs, and has served as president of the National Dorothea Dix Memorial Association since its inauguration in 1899. But her duties as president are but a small part of her work along this line. She has written, spoken, and travelled, ai'- ranged fairs, interested ])eople to contribute, and has appeared in Congress to plead sjiecially for an appropriation toward erecting a monu- ment to the memory of Miss Dix.
