Mary E. Barstow (now Mrs. MacGregor) was educated in the public schools of Portland, completing her course of study in the high school. On November 12, 1!S59, she was mar- ried to Gains B. MacGregor, of Lock Haven, Pa., the descendant of a long line of sturdy Scottish ancestors, all of marked nuisical abil- ity. His grandfather MacGregor, who was a Revolutionary soldier, married Betsey Bellows, whose family, it is said, figured co.nspicuously in the early history of A'ennont, her father being an eminent jurist.

The early married life of Mrs. MacGregor was |)assed in States west of New F^-nglnnd. Twenty- two years ago she returned to her native city, where at present she is known as tlie "children's frieml."

The society for the protection and care of friendless and destitute Ijoys of Maine was es- tablished February 9, 1S98. After two years of practical experience in placing boys for adoption in country or city homes, and thus removing them from vicious surroundings, it was deemed wise to establish a home where neglected boys might have proper care until permanent places could be obtained for them. The actual necessity for such a temijorary home was shown in the fact that many boys, taken from bad surroundings and sometimes

inheriting evil tendencies, required special train- ing and some refining influences before they were eligible for permanent homes. Accordingly a building was leased, November, 1895, to be known as the Maine Home for Friendless Boys. I'urnishings and some money were solicited, but, as no assured fund was forthcoming, special effort has been made constantly for this ])nr- pose. A new l)uilding was erected in Portland, and formally opened in February, 1901. The success and present prosjjerity of the home is due largely to the energy and per.severance of Mrs. MacGregor, the president and the originator of the ])lan of work. She lias interested Maine peoi:)le in the enterj^rise, and to-day the insti- tution represents in a large degree her labor and influence.

For the i)ast twelve years Mrs. MacGregor has been an indefatigable worker in the Fresh Air Society of Portland, of which she was one of the original founders. She served most ac- ceptably for twelve years as a director of the Female Samaritan Association, and then re- signed the jiosition to devote her time to the Home for Boys.

Aside from philanthropic work, she is prom- inently known in social and literary circles of Portland, her connection with the Monday Club (one of the first women's clubs organized in that cit)') extending over a period of twenty years. As a member of the Woman's Literary Union, her influence has been helpful, both through contributions from her pen and her efforts to establish a high ideal.

Mrs. MacGregor is a most a])proachable, sympathetic woman, ever nvidy to do some- thing toward lightening tlic bvu'dcns of the sorrowing.

Ellen B.\rst()w M.\cGhecor, of Portland, Me., the daughter of Gains B. and Mary E. ( Bar- stow) MacGregor, was educated at Temple Grove Seminary, Saratoga, N.Y., where she ranked high as a student. She is now well known as a ])ianist and com])o.ser. She inherited her nuisical talent from her father's family, who claim some noted nmsicians of the past. When only two 3'ears of age she conunitted to memory a num- ber of tunes, and accurately sang them. At the age of five siie comj)ose(l little pieces, which
