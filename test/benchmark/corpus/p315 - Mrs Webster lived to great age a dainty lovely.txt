Mrs. Webster lived to great age, a dainty, lovely woman, dying January 31, 1896.

Miss Sanborn was educated at home by her father almost entirely, though tutors in math- ematics were employed for her. Her drill in Latin commenced at eight years with studying a Latin booklet, and continued till she left home to support herself. It comprised more than a college course. This year after year of translating, scanning, wortl selection and phrasing, was a wonderful training in language. She was obliged to connuit to memory some portion of prose or poetry daily, and also to describe something in writing. Then followetl apt quotations at the tea-table, later a good anecdote. These teachings and tasks of mind and memory were not dull drill, but part of every-day, social family life.

W'hile such instruction set the course of her career, it accomplished a thousand times more, giving a splendid memory, ready for use. Daily writing under skilled criticism, studying the light and shade of word and expression, the use of synonyms, pointed the " inevitable nib " to her pen and also to her speech, so adding another powet to naturally great mental en- dowment. It was the love of her father and her love for him which was ever the essential feature of this instruction: there was in it no drudgery for teacher or pupil.

At eleven she earned three dollars for a little story her father sent to a child's paper, and thus began a brilliant career successful beyond most and still continuing.

The brightness of Miss Sanborn's books is like sunlight glinting clear brooks and lighting

their depths. There is nothing tempestuous or gusty about her composition, yet it is full of anecdote, spirit, wit â€” keen thrusts in plenty, but without spite, worded to a nicety, but never shorn of strength. She inherited a love for teaching, and began that employment in the ell of her father's house, then went with him to St. Louis, where she taught in Mary Institute, connected with Washington Univer- sity, at a salary of five hundred dollars per year, of which she was very proud. After, she taught elocution in Packer Institute, Brooklyn, so well that Henry Ward Beecher said, "There used to be a few prize pumpkins here, but now each pupil is doing good work." At the .same time she gave twenty lectures in New York City each season upon such subjects as "Bachelor Authors," " Punch as a Reformer," "Literary Gossips," "Spinster Authors of England," and so forth.

In its early days Smith College called her to teach English literature, and here she created the "Round Table Series of Literature," once published and used by many teachers. No mortal can go over this collection of complete and exact tables without knowing English letters correctly nor look at one diagram five minutes unprofitably. It shows marvellous power of concentration and "monumental drudgery." During her three years at Smith Miss Sanborn lectured in Springfield, at Mrs. Terhune's, and in many towns near the college. Leaving Smith, she went on a lecturing tour through the A^'est, and met success everywhere. The exact knowledge, newness of thought and subjects, elegant phrasing, and keen wit of this gifted, warm-hearted New England woman touched the Westerners. Great and enthusi- astic audiences greeted her. Prairie folk were proud of this deputy from Eastern home people, and they made her stay among them a notable event.
