AE DURELL FRAZAR was born Calais, Me. Her father, the

m

J^^ Y J_ Rev. George Wells Durell, was an Episcopalian clergyman. The early years of her life were spent in the quiet New England town of her birth. Later the family removed to Somerville, Mass., where she attended the public schools. She married General Douglas Frazar, a gentleman who had travelled widely and had nmch literary attainment. He was the author of several books, one of which, "Practical Boat Sailing," has been translated into many lan- guages, and is in use to-day among all standard yacht clubs. When asked where she received her education, Mrs. Frazar answers: "Why, I am being educated now. It has been a daily growth right along. All that I am. however, I feel that I owe to Mr. Frazai. In my own home I learned rich lessons from books, people, and the world."

Mrs. Frazar is, doubtless, the best known and the most enterjirising and successful if not the only woman tourist agent in the LTnited States. She is a cheery, wide-awake body, full of originality and up-to-date ideas. The story of the life of the woman who has personally conducted abroad, with skill and .satisfaction during the past twelve years,

the "Frazar Parties," frecjuently mentioned in the newspapers of our own antl other coun- tries, is most interesting.

A chance visitor will find her in her office at almost any hour of the day, busy at her desk; for she is a journalist and lecturer as well as guide and philosopher. She is so calm in manner, so full of courteous attention to her caller, that it is difficult to realize what an indefatigable worker the woman is. Quick and keen in business, energetic, courageous in expressing her views, she is yet a most womanly woman. Contact with the world has not robbed her of her strong personality or her feminine refinement.

It was after several years of intermittent newsjiaper writing that Mrs. Frazar became editor and publisher of a paper called The Home Life. As the name implies, it was meant to be useful and instructive to all members of the family. It was a journal of sixteen pages and of excellent literary cpiality. She eilited it entirely herself and attended to all the ailvertising, bringing the circulation up in three years to over ten thou- sand copies. When engaged in this work she came in contact with all sorts antl con- ditions of men, and gained an intimate knowl- edge of business life.

Yielding to an urgent recjuest to take charge of a party of young people during a European trip, she returned to find General Frazar's health failing. A change of climate was (.rdered, and they took up their residence in the city of Mexico. This change necessi- tated giving up the paper. Being sole owner of i' business, she quickly arranged with anotiiL-r journal to fill her subscriptions until their expiration. She retained all the copy- rights, and looks forward to the day when she shall have opportunity to give The Home Life a new lease of existence.
