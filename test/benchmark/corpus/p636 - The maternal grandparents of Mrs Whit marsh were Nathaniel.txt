Skelton, daughter of the Rev. Samuel Skelton, the first minister of Salem.

Mrs. Mary A. Stiles was for years a teacher. Her daughter, through her influence early in- terested in good reading, was educated in the schools of Barre (attending successively a dis- trict school and the high school) and at Pierce Academy in Middleboro (co-educational), then one of the leading secondary schools of New England.

Two subjects have always held Mrs. Whit- marsh's attention, natural history and materia medica. In studying the latter she grew more and more attracted toward that branch of sci- ence, and in the fall of 1896 she entered the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. After one year's hard study — the rules of the school necessitating four years' actual experience — Mrs. Whitmarsh decided that such experience should be in an establishment of her own. Accordingly she fitted up a new store with fine equipments at Geneva Avenue, Dorchester, to which during the ensuing year she gave her entire time and attention. In 1899 she re- sumed her stutlies, dividing her hours between school and her place of business. She was graduated in 1901, receiving her diploma for having satisfactorily finished the general course. Since that time she has been absorbed in her rapidly growing business. She is a popular woman in her community, and is alike re- spected for her ability and integrity.

Mr. and Mrs. Whitmarsh have always at- tended the Congregational church. For clubs she has no time, although in sympathy with their work; and her duties make her but an irregular attendant at the Daughters of Re- bekah Lodge, of which she has been a member for several years. Mr. Whitmarsh is a skilled {)attern-maker in iron work.

VINA BOYNTON PEAKES, of Boston, is an energetic business woman who has achieved success in the field of insurance. The necessity of earn- ing her owm livelihood came about through the death of her husband. After turning over in her own mind the few profitable occupations that offered honorable employment for women,

she decided upon insurance, and accordingly studied the methods employed by men in the presentation of that subject, striving in par- ticular to acquire a direct and business-like manner. Her efforts were successful, and, step by step, she has advanced from her early beginnings until to-day she stands as one of the leading women insurance underwriters of Boston, which city, it may be said, has the only association of women underwriters in the world. Mrs. Peakes is an independent agent, not being connected with a women's department. She approves of the admis- sion of women to all professions and all suita- ble lines of business, ami takes great pleasure in noting the success they are achieving in their various undertakings.
