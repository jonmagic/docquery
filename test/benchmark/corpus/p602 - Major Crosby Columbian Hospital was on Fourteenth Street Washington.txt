Major Crosby." Columbian Hospital was on Fourteenth Street, Washington, and was in charge of Dr. Thomas R. Crosby. Shortly after. Miss Burghardt having been granted a furlough for rest, she was placetl in temporary care of her ward, the surgeon of which was Dr. F. H. Marsh, of Michigan. By request of Dr. Crosby she was retained at the Columbian Hos- pital, and upon the return of Miss Burghardt was assigned to Ward Two, where she remained until June 27, 1865, when the hospital was closed.

Her experiences while in charge of this ward have been recorded by Mrs. Hazen in the history of "Our Army Nurses." She thus refers to the summer of 1864: "The hospital was filled in May with wounded from the Wilderne.ss. Then came the battle at Spottsylvania and June 1 the battle of Cold Harbor. From the latter battle-field my youngest brother was brought to my ward. At the first I was so rejoiced to see him alive I did not feel sorry that he had been wounded. After each arrival from the front all who could be moved were transferred to hospitals more remote, to make room for the next arrivals from the battle-fields, until at last the wards were filled with very badly wounded men, some soon crossing to the other shore, others lingering for months, suffering untold agonies ere the longed-for rest came. Still others lived to carry through life crippled bodies. Many were the letters written for tho.se unable to write to tlie dear father, mother, brother, sister, or sweetheart, and many the letters received with thanks from the absent friends.

" During June, July, August, and September our heads, hands, and hearts were taxed to the utmost. . . . There were many deaths, each one, as the last hours came, saying: 'Oh, please. Miss Titus, stay with me. It will be but a short time. You seem so like a sister.' So hour after hour I watched the life-light flicker and tlie of many noble men whose lives were a sacrifice for their country. . . . Later we had our bright ilays, too, when wit and song prevailed, and occasionally had time to make (as the boys said) 'pies and other things like what we hatl at home.' The boys

would bring the tables from the rooms, placing them end to end through the hall, making a long table, where all the men able to leave their beds sat down to a home-like meal."

Mrs. Hazen relates the case of Sergeant Eli Hudson, of Pennsylvania, who was wounded in the knee in the spring of 1865. He was a mere boy, but had served over four years, and had for several months been a patient in her ward. The surgeons hail held several consultations, l)ut he was failing rapidly, his disease being hemorrhage of the stomach. When the verdict was given that he could live but a few flays, Mrs. Hazen asked per- mission to give him what he wanted to eat while he lived; and the doctor surrendered the entire charge of him to her care. She says : " I at once removed the bandages, as he complained that they were uncomfortable. As soon as the patients were all cared for, I went to a market-garden and bought a head of cabbage. He had often said he wanted something green. When the cabbage was cooked, I carried him some with cider vinegar. He ate all on the plate, asked for more, which was brought, and still a third and fourth plate, till he had eaten the whole cabbage. From that dinner in May he began to improve, and on the 14th of June I startefl with Sergeant Hudson on a stretcher for his home." He recovered, but had a stiff knee.
