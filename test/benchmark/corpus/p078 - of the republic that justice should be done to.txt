of the republic that justice should be done to the lowest and weakest within its borders.

A leading clergyman has said of Mrs. Wood- bury, "She is easily one of the greatest femi- nine powers of the early twentieth century in the advocacy of American patriotic Christian philanthropy.''

Mrs. Woodbury has had four children. The eldest, Carl Vose, was graduated from Bowdoin College in 1899, and is now a professor in Nor- wich University, Northfield, Vt. The second, Donald Clinton, died in childhood. The third, Malcolm Sumner, was graduated from Bowdoin in 1903, and is now a medical student in the same institution ; and the fourth, Ruth Lin- coln, is in the high school at Dennysville, Me.

ELIZABETH ORR WILLIAMS, journal- ist and lecturer, resides in Brookline, Mass. She is the wife of Melvin Brooks Williams, grandson of Captain John \\'illiams, of ha))py memory, of Portland, Me. Mrs. A\'illiams was born in Alfred, Me., being the daughter of the Rev. John and Mary (Moore) Orr. The original home of the Orr family was in Scotland, whence some of their number re- moved, doubtless in the latter part of the sev- enteenth century, to Ireland.

John Orr, great-great-grandfather of Mrs. ^\'illianls, came to this country from tlie north of Ireland in 1726, in cjuest of civil and religious liberty, and resided for a time in Londonderry, N.H. In 1750 he was one of the petitioners for the incorporation of the town of Bedford, N.H. It is not known whether he was born in Scotland or born in Ireland of Scottish parents. Both he and his l)rothcr Daniel, who came with him, are believed to have been teachers by profession. John Orr, it is said, was remark- able for his Scotch wit, and was highly respected as a "fine specimen of a shrewd, pious, plain- hearted Scotcliman, much like the one por- trayed by Scott in the father of Jeanie Deans, in the 'Heart of Midlothian.' "

Mrs. Williams's great-grandfather, the Hon. .John Orr, was for many years an Elder in the Presbyterian church in Bedford, servuig also as Justice of the Peace and the Quorum, as

Senator from the Thiril District, as Counsellor of Hillsborough County, and for several years as Representative at the General Court of the State of New Hampshire. He performed mili- tary service in the French War in 1756, and in 1777 he was appointed by the Provincial Coun- cil a member of the Committee of Safety. In this latter year also he was commissioned as a Lieutenant, and with his company served under the command of General Stark at the battle of Bennington, where, after exhibiting cool judgment and great personal bravery, he was wounded and rendered a cripple for life. The verdict of one who knew him well was thus tersely expressed: "He was one of Nature's nobility."

His son, the Hon. Benjamin Orr, grandfather of Mrs. Williams, was born in Bedford, N.H., in 1772, and was graduated at Dartmouth Col- lege with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1798. He became a lawyer and settled in Maine, his home, with the exception of a few years that he resided in Topsham, being in Brimswick. He was eminent as a practitioner in the Su- preme Judicial Court both before and after the separation of Maine from Massachusetts. He represented the old Cumberland District in Congress during the Presidency of James Monroe.
