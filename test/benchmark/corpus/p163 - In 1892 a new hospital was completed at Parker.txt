In 1892 a new hospital was completed at Parker Hill, between Brookline and Boston. The Legislature subsequently granted fifteen thousand dollars, which cleared off its in- debtedness. The Club now numbers nearly seven hundretl members, and this hospital stands a proutl monument of their good work. Mrs. Dyer has been the president from the first. The badge of the Club is a circular pin sur- mounted with the head of the presitleiit in bronze.

Mrs. Dyer is the organizer antl president of the Wintergreen Club, to which only women of fifty are eligible. It is named for the real wintergreen, which is green and glossy under the snow, retaining its youthful freshness, as good women do. Among its members are Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Maria H. Bray, Mrs. Kate Tannatt Woods, and Mrs. Louis Prang.

Another little society which Mrs. Dyer ini-

tiated a few years ago is the "Take Heed," from the text, "Take heed that ye speak not evil of one another." She is also president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Lipham's Corner, an office she has filled for seven years, being its second president, re- signing at one time, and accepting the office again in 1899. She is a valued member and one of the boaril of directors of the Castilian Club, and a life member of tlie Bostonian Society. Among other societies and clubs with which she has been actively connected may be named the Moral Education Society, the National Prison Association, the Benefit Society for the University Education of Women, the Helping Hand Society, the Dorchester \\'omaii's Clul), and the Book Review C'lub of Dorchester, the last-named two being strictly literary clubs. It has been estinnited that some- thing like a ([uarter of a million has been raised for charities through her inspiring lead rship.

Early inclined to literary work, foi which the duties that came to lier left little time, Mrs. Dyer has written, mainly for her clubs, in her â– scant leisure, many acce|)table essays and poems. Her one great grief has been the loss of her husband, whose hearty support she had in all of her undertakings. Since his death, November 24, 1898, she has made her home with her son and his wife, on Columliia Road, Dorchester, having her own suite of rooms, where she still continues to tlispen.se her bomi- tiful hospitality.

Mrs. Livermore, in her cliaracteristic, im- pulsive way, summing up Mrs. Dyer's amiable qualities, says, " I always think of her as al- ways cheery, always charming, always harmo- nious, and altogethei' the most delightful woman of my acquaintance."
