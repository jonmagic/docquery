The constant aim of all her teaching and writing is the simplification of the processes of housekeeping. She devotes herself not to a multiplication of recipes and the preparation of fancy dishes, but the teaching of funda- mental principles, from which each housekeeper may adapt herself to her individual limitations and needs. The agricultural and horticultural bearings of the subject are particularly inter- esting to her.

For several years a summer school of cookery at the Fryeburg Chautauqua Assembly was in her charge. From this she was called to be instructor in cookery at the School of Domestic Science of the original Chautauqua in New York State. She has been superintendent of the department of hygienic cooking in the Mas- sachusetts W. C. T. U., president of the Cooking School Teachers' League, director of the Na- tional Hou.sehold Economic Association, and secretary of the Association of the Alumni and Friends of Fryeburg Academy, a Massachusetts corporation.

In 1900 Mi.ss Barrows was chosen a member of the Boston School Committee, being nomi- nated on a reform ticket and endorsed by the Independent Women Voters and the Republi- cans. Although she made no personal canvass, she was elected by the largest number of votes cast for any city officer at that election. Her

work on the connnittee was done quietly, with careful regard for the interests of the schools.

REV. SARAH A. DIXON, S.T.B., pas- tor of the Congregational church in .^ Tyngsborough, Ma.'^s., was boin in the town of Barnstable, on Cape Cod, where her parents, William and Joice (Cas- coyne) Dixon, natives f)f Warwickshire, Eng- land (the father a soldier in the Fortieth Mas- sachusetts Regiment in 1862), are now living.

When asked not long ago concerning her "call to preach," she replied, "I had always had a great desire to hel}) people, and when about twenty years of age this desire developed into a definite decision to be a minister."

Miss Dixon's early life was her best prepara- tion. Her girlhood was sjjcnt mostly in school and out of doors, her home being near the shore; and her young soul was filled with the incense from the fields, the marshes, and the sea.

Two early incidents proved to be determin- ing factors in her life. One was the "redemp- tion" which came to her through the influence of her grannnar school teacher. His interest and keen insight into her nature inspired her with an ambition to excel, and changed her from a "trouble" in the school into a student. From this time until she was sixteen lessons were mastered and liigh rank held without any definite hope of oiipoituiiities for a higher edu- cation.

The other determining incident came when Miss Dixon was sixteen years old. Two young women of Barnstable, hearing of her progress in her studies, became interested in her wel- fare. They offered to help send her to Bridge- water Normal School. Her parents were very glad to accept the kindness, as they were not possessed of an abundance of this world's goods, and tliey had a large family. By giv- ing enterlaiiimcnts and soliciting among their friends these two ladies w(&gt;re enabletl to raise the money to ])ay her expenses for the first }'ear. Accordingly she entered Bridgewater
