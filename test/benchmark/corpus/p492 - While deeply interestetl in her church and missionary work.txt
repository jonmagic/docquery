For the past twelve years Mrs. Chapman has been a leading spirit in Maine in the work of the McAll Mission, to which she is earnestly devoted. This mission was founded by the Rev. Robert W. McAll (Congregationalist), a native of Macclesfield, England, for the purpose of giving religious instruction, "highly evangelical and undenominational," to the common people of France. The wf)rk was begun in Paris by Mr. McAll and his wife in July, 1872, and continued by him until his death in 1893. Dispensaries, industrial schools, and reading-rooms are sustained by the mi.ssion, which does not establish churches. The American McAll A.ssociation, for the collection of funds, was founded in 1883.

The Portland McAll Auxiliary, for the same object, was organized in February, 1887, in State Street Chapel, under the direction of Professor J. C. Bracq, general secretary of the American McAll Association. Mrs. Ellen Carpenter was elected president, and served until her removal from that city. For many months Mrs. W^illiam H. Fenn, vice- president of the American A.ssociation, pre- sided over the meetings. In November, 1890,

Mrs. Carpenter resigned, and ^Mrs. Chapman, who had been one of the vice-presidents since its organization, was elected to fill the vacancy. The work progressed under her direction, and the next year a new station was opened through the efforts of the mission. For the support of this, in addition to money given for the general work, one hundred dol- lars is annually expended. Mrs. Chapman in- troduced ])arlor meetings, which have been regularly held. These gatherings are of social interest and helpful in advancing the cau.se. In May last the treasurer announced a gift of one thousand dollars from an unknown friend. The a.ssociation has al)out one hun- dred members, and has contributed over f(jur thousand dollars to the work of missions in France. Mrs. H. W. Noyes has held for twelve years the office of secretary of the Porthincl Mission. At the annual meetings of the American Association Mrs. Chapman has represented in an able maimer the local .society.

Mrs. Chapman is a director of the S. P. C. A. Society and a member of the Literary and Benevolent Associates. She is planning an extensive trip abroad, and during her travels will visit different branches of the McAll Mission.
