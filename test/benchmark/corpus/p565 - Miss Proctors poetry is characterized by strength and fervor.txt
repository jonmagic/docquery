Mi.ss Proctor's poetry is characterized by strength and fervor, by lofty thought and melodious numbers. Though so patriotic an American, her sympathies enable her to under- stand the heart of other races. No truer ex- ])ression of the feeling of a devout, orthodox Russian has been given than her poem " Holy Russia," which Longfellow regrettetl was not written early enough to be included in his "Russia" ("Poems of Places"), saying, "It would have been a splendid prelude to the volume." Of her "El Mahdi to the Tribes of the Soudan" the late Professor Frederick W. H. Myers, of Cambridge, England, said, "It is .so Oriental I can hartUy believe it was writ- ten by any one in the AVestern worUl"; and the late James Darmesteter, professor in the College of France, wrote her from Constantinople, ask- ing to include it in a new edition of his brochure of 1885, " The Mahdi." Her " Song of the Ancient People" — the Pueblos of our South- west— has the dignity and pathos of a race

that beholds all it revered and cherished slip- ping away. The late John Fiske, in his preface to the "Song," says of it: " As a rendering of Moqui-Zuni thought, it is a contribution of great and permanent value to American litera- ture." Yet her sympathies are not alone for matters of race and nation, but are warm and loyal in home and social life, and all express the power and charm of her personality. Appended are two of her poems.

MOXADNOCK IN OCTOBER.

Uprose Monadiiock in tlie northern blue,

A glorious minster buUdcd to the Lord!

The setting sun his crimson radiance threw

On crest, and steep, and wood, and valley sward,

Blending tlieir myriad hues in rich accord,

Till, like the wall of heaven, it towered to view.

Along its slope, where russet ferns were strewn

And purple heaths, the scarlet maples flamed,

And reddening oaks and golden birches shone —

Resplendent oriels in the black pines framed,

The pines that climb to woo the winds alone.

And down its cloisters blew the evening breeze,

Through courts and aisles ablaze with autumn bloom.

Till shrine and portal thrilled to harmonies

Now soaring, dying now in glade and gloom.

And with the wind was heard the voice of streams —

Constant their Aves and Te Deums be —

Lone Ashuelot nuirmuring down the lea,

And brooks that haste where shy Contoocook gleams

Through groves and mead&lt;^ws, broadening to the sea.

Then lioly twilight fell on earth and air;

Above the dome the stars hung faint and fair.

And the vast minster hushed its shrines in prayer;

While all the lesser heights kejit watch and ward

About Mouaduock, builded to the Lord!

BORN OF THE SPIRIT.

She called me a moment before, And smiled, as I entered the door,

In her gentle way ; A sigh, a droop of the head, And something forever had fled.

And she was but clay !

Her hand was yet clasped in mine, And bright, in the golden shine.
