Mrs. S|)aulding is a w'oman of pleasing pres- ence, bright, attractive, and a most interesting conversationalist. In giving attention to public work she has never, in the least, neglected her household duties. Her charming residence in

Caribou is an ideal home, where all the domestic virtues are fully exemplified.

This brief notice was written by one who has long known and loved her, and who.se most difficult task, in writing these lines, has been to refrain from too much of compliment and praise, he being aware that anything like fulsome flattery would be to her extremely distasteful.

ANNA FLORENCE GRANT, printer, /\ is a native of Portland, Maine. Her -Z _\. parents. Captain Frank M. and Joan Morse (Grant) Grant, removing to Bos- ton in her girlhood, her education was received in the public schools of both cities. After her graduation she took a full cour.se at Bur- ilett's Business College, which she completed with honors. Her aptitutle for a business ca- reer early began to manifest itself, and, when she was only twenty years old, she availed herself of an opportunity to buy out the printing e.s- tablishment on Court Street, Boston, of two young men who were selling out. Becom- ing proprietor of the entire business plant, she proceeded to luiild up a trade. In these times of sharp competition it is no simple mat- ter to achieve success along any line, and the art preservative of all arts is far from being an exception. This Mi.ss Grant, with her su- perior ([ualifications and recognizing no such word as fail, has done. Entering the business without previous experience other than that gained by frequenting a printing-office and learning to set type as a pastime, she cjuickly mastered the details, and became very proficient in type-setting, proof-reading, making-up, and printing.

At this time Miss Grant was the only woman in Boston who owned and operated a printing establishment â€” an establishment, too, of which any man might well be proud, containing large presses run by electricity and having men as type-setters and in the shipping-room. Dur- ing the first year (1891) she advertised largely, and received orders from every State and Ter- ritory in the Union, as well as some from abroad. One important factor in her business is the en- graving and printing of fine invitations and

cards for weddings and society events gener- ally. Another department in which she takes especial pride is that of making blank bonks, in connection with which she takes orders for binding, ruling, perforating, and electrotyping. She has printed everything, from a newspaper to a label the size of a postage stanij); from cards to law blanks, pamphlets, and books.

She is stationer for several leading women's clubs, and does stamping and embossing of the best (luality. She is a very careful manager, making all her own estimates and figuring on contract work. She has many original ideas about her work, one of her specialties being advertising novelties. She has also manu- factured some labor-saving devices for the counting-room, one of which, the "acme petty ledger," has met with a large sale. Her present place of business is at 42 Summer Street.
