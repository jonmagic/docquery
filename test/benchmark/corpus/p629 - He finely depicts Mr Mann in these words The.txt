He finely depicts Mr. Mann in these words:

"The most striking characteristic of Mr. Mann'.s nature was his ethical passion. ... To feel that a thing was right, either for himself or others, was a challenge to its performance or to its earnest defence, if nothing else was possible, which he never allowed to go unheeded."

To a young teacher, close association with so noble a nature as Horace Mann, and with those his fine instinct ilrew around him, may well be counted high privilege. Miss Eastman counts especially, among the many recognitions which she has so generously and so gratefully received, one from President Horace Mann, made shortly after her withdrawal from An- tioch College:

Minister Sarmiento, Representative of Buenos Ayres to the United States, advised President Mann of the desire of his government to im- prove its schools by the introduction of the most approved methods in use in the United States. He also asked him to suggest a suit- able person to conduct such a work. Presi- dent Mann wrote to Miss Eastman, to ask if she would meet Minister Sarmiento to con- sider with him the undertaking of such a work. Miss Eastman felt, however, that more matu- rity and wider experience than she possessed at the age of twenty-five were required, unle.ss a considerable time could be allowed for due preparation; nor woukl her family consent to the wide separation involved in her going so far from home.

On returning to Lowell, she was given charge of the girls' department of the high school, numbering about two hundred pupils. After several years in this position she was invited to Meadville, Pa., as principal of a young lathes' seminary, endowed by the benefactions of the esteemed Huidekoper family. During seven years of her stay here she was the happy sharer of the home of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Huitlekoper. One evening at a reception at the Unitarian Divinity School a group fell into a conversation which leil to some consideration of woman suffrage. After the party was over, the stu- dents met, and voted to invite Miss Eastman to give her views on the subject more fully in their chapel, and appointed a committee to extend the invitation. A fine audience gath- ered, and this was her first public address.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

On returning to Massachusetts she was in- vited by Mrs. Lucy Stone to deliver the address in New England. This inaugurated a work of many years throughout the country and its adjacent provinces that was prosecuted from the platform and occasionally from the pulpit. This work proved of the deepest interest to Miss Eastman, antl, judging from the unani- mous tone of audiences and press, her listeners found it no less so. It soon became an open question with her whether to abandon the con- genial educational work for that of the plat- form. She reminded her mother, who was naturally chary of her daughter's reputation, that in advocating an unpopular cause she should pass out of the accustomed sphere of general sympathy and probably meet criti- cism and even misrepresentation, and asked her if she could bear it. Her mother felt most keenly the need of service along the line of the new departure, and replied, in the brave spirit of the mother of the Gracchi, " It will be hard, but I can endure even that better than I can bear to have you reach my age and feel, as I do, that I have seen all my life the great harm to both men and women which this non-repre- sentation of women works, and yet have done nothing to correct it." In this the mother was mistaken, for within the limits of a private sphere she had valorously and with rare in- fluence championed the cause of equal rights and opportunities, in which she had the sym- pathy of her husband. The world was kinder to her daughter than she had dared hope, for these heroic souls, Lucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mrs. Livermore, and their cotemporary peers, with a dignity and a sweetness befitting their cause, turned the sharpest point of their op- ponents' steel.
