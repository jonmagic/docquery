Miss Geddes is a graduate of Chauncy Hall

School, Boston, which she entered at the age of eight, and of Radcliffe College, class of LS99. After leaving Radcliffe, she studied at Newn- ham College. As a result of her special fond- ness for English literature and of her familiarity with the homes antl haunts of literary men and women abroad, she was led to enter upon the field of work which has brought her fame.

In October, 1901, a large audience listened to a "Recital of Literary Romances" by Miss Geddes. Clearly and distinctly, without af- fectation, she read the stories .she had written of the love episodes in the liA'es of Swift and his Stella, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Brown- ing, and Carlyle and Jane W^elsh. Her hearers, among them being many literary critics, mar- velled at the purity and beauty of these sketches, as well as at their keen insight and penetration into character.

The next morning the leading Boston papers announced the appearance of a new star in the literary firmament, and letters congratulatory were followed by letters of inquiry as to terms for lecture and class work. Thus, at the early age of twenty-five. Miss Geddes became much in demand to give lectures and recitals and lead classes in eighteenth century and Victorian literature.

The secret of her popularity lies in the new- ness of her methods; for in her analysis of a great work of literature she gives merely sta- tistics enough to identify the period, and avoids repeating well-known truisms and general state- ments. She goes below the outer shell, and unearths the inner meaning of the work, the causes which produced it, and the effect of its existence. She is now preparing a course of ten lectures on "The Novel and Life," which will follow the parallel development of civiliza- tion and the English novel.

In spite of the amount of brain work which so many demands call from her, she has not lost her girlishness, and is much sought after at the gatherings of young people in Cam- bridge. She is much interested in club work, being a member of the Cambridge Art Circle, the ("antal)rigia" Club, the Woman's Charity Club, the Metaphysical Club, the Actors' Church Alliance, the New England Woman's Press As- sociation, and the Ruskin Club.

Her personality is chanuing, and her natural- ness of manner makes her a pleasing picture on the lecture platform and an ins])iring leailer in class work.

In March, 1903, she took the most ambitious step of all. She purchasetl a well-known Cam- bridge newspaper, The Cambridge Prefts, and announced in the first number that it would be devoted to tlie interests of Cambritlge, and that it would be owned, edited, and conducted en- tirely by women. This innovation was a wel- come one, and the excellent sheet is a source of [jride to the whole city. There is not a weak point about it. Miss Geddes is a born journa- list, and her editorials are fine samples of lit- erarv style and fearless utterance.
