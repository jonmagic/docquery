signatures had reached nearly four hundred thousand. Charles Sunmer and Henry Wilson testified that " these petitions formed the bul- wark of their demand for Congressional action to abolish slavery."

In January, ISfiS, a few weeks after the re- turn of Miss Anthony from Kansa.s, where in the fall of 1867 she had taken part in the suf- frage campaign for woman and the negro man, was issued in New York City the first number of the Revolution, a weekly paper conducted by Mi.ss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton in the inter- ests of women, George Francis Train and David M. Melliss, of the New York World, agreeing to sup])ly the needful funds until the paper should be on a paying basis. Its motto was: "Men, their rights and nothing more. Women, their rights and nothing less." Parker Pillsbury was one of the editors. The undertaking was con- sidered ill-advi.sed by the majority of suffragists. Miss Anthony writes: "All the old friends, with scarce an exce|ition, are sure we are wrong. Only time can tell, but I believe we are right, hence bound to succeed." The New York Home Journal comments: "The Revolution is plucky, keen, and wide-awake. Some of its ways are not at all to our taste, yet we are glad to recognize in it the inspiration of the noblest aims, and the sagacity and talent to accom])lish what it desires. It is on the right track, whether it has taken the right train or not."

The Independent, in concluding a "breezy editorial," said, "Its business management is in the good hands of Miss Susan B. Anthony, who has long been known as one of the most indefatigable, honest, obstinate, faithful, cross- grained, and noble-minded of the famous women of America."

After two and one-half years of hard work the Revolution was given up for financial reasons, Miss Anthony assuming ))ersonally the entire indcljtedness, ten tliousand dollars. She wasted no time in mourning over her disappointment and losses. Alone she started to earn the money to pay this debt with interest. For an evening lectiu'e at Hornellsville four davs later she received one hundred and fifty dollars. Says her biographer, "Miss Anthony worked unceasingly through winter's cold and sum- mer's heat, lecturing sometimes under private

auspices, sometimes under those of a bureau, and herself arranging for unengaged nights." In six years the work was done. On May 1, 1876, she wrote: "The (iay of juhile(&gt; for nie has come. I have paid the last dollar of the Revolution debt!"

On November 5, 1S72, at an election held in the city of Rochester for a Rej^resentative in Congress, Susan B. Anthony and fourteen otlier women cast their ballots. This remarkable act was done untler the conviction that it was in accordance with the Constitution of the United States, as explained by Francis Minor, of St. Louis, Henry R. Selilen, of Rochester, and Albert G. Riddle, of A\'ashington, all lead- ing members of the bar, who believed women had a right to vote under the Fourteenth Amend- ment. It was also intended as a test case. Many of the leading ])apers supported her, but the fifteen women of Rochester who voted were all arrested. Miss Anthony's trial took place in June, 1S73, at Canandaigua. Judge Selden testified that he advised her to vote, and in a masterly address argued her case from a legal, constitutional, and moral standpoint. The prosecuting attorney followed. Associate Justice Ward Hunt then delivered his opinion, and directed the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty. The next day he sentenced her to pay a fine of one hundred dollars and costs. "May it plea.se your honor," said she, "I will never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty," and she never did. Even by opponents of woman suf- frage the action of Judge Hunt was denounced as arbitrary and illegal.
