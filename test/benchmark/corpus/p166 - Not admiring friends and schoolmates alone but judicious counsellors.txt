Not admiring friends and schoolmates alone, but judicious counsellors, among them Colonel Higginson, encouraged her literary aspirations. Sketches, stories, and verses from her pen found their way into print, and probably brought money into her purse.

Her first contribution to the Atlantic Montldy, "In a Cellar," appearing in February, 1859, is remembei'ed l)y one who.se opinion is of value as "an ingenious and amusing story, well told." Tlie .same early reader and critic adds: "Her tale of 'The Amber Gods,' published soon after- ward in the same magazine, was of a higher and larger scope, full of power and passion. Scarcely less powerful was a sketch named ' Cir- cumstance.' These stories at once gained for the author a high place among writers of fic- tion."

She continued to use her pen. To quote again from Mrs. Cooke: " Under her quiet aspect, wistful regard, and shy manner, lay a soul full of imagination and pa.ssion and a nature that revelled in the use of words to express this fire and force. In her hands the English language became sonorous, gorgeous, burning."

In 1865 Harriet Prescott was married to Richard S. Spofford, of Newburyport. Joy in the birth of a child in the ensuing year was

followed a few months later l)y sorrow for its loss. With the exception of some time spent in Washington, D.C., the home of Mrs. vSpof- ford has been on Deer Island, between New- biiryport and Amesbury. Here Mr. Spofford died in August, LSSS. Several winter seasons of recent years Mrs. Spofford has passed in Boston. In the sunmier.of 1908 she went to Europe with her sister, her niece, and her ward, sailing on the same steamer witii her friend, Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, in her annual visit to England. The present winter (1903- 190-1) she is in Paris.

Mrs. S])offord as a writer is exceptionally happy in her estimates and appreciations of other women authors and their work: witness, for example, the biographical sketch appearing over her signature in another part of this book, her criticism of the poems of Anne AVhit- ney in the NortJi Ameiican Re&lt;ie&gt;v for 1860, and her article on "The Author of Charles Auches- ter," in the Atlnntic Monthlij, June, 1S62.

Among her books may here be mentioned, not to give an exhaustive list: "Sir Rohan's Ghost," "Azarian," "New I'jigland Legends," "Art Decoration," "The Servant Question," "Hester Stanley at Saint Mark's," "Poems," "In Titian's Garden," "Ballads about Au- thors," "The Children of the Valley" (1901), "The Great Procession" (1902).

Her most recent work in the Athmtic (Novem- ber and December, 1903), "The Story of the Queen," a short novel in two chapters, is one that could hardly have been written before the dawn of the twentieth century, and would never have been written, just so felicitously and out of the heart, by any other pen than that of Mrs. Spofford, idealist.

"I read it with delight," says Mrs. Moulton, referring to this story, and adding these words to emphasize her admiration for Mrs. Spofford as a poet as well as a story writer: "There is a far-reaching grandeur of thought and imag- ination in her poetic work. To lyric grace and charm she adds breadth of view and nobility of conception. She is neighbor to the stars. The blind poet, Philip Bourke Marston, was a great admirer of her work, as are many other English I'eaders of high degree, among them the professor of poetry at the University of (Jx-
