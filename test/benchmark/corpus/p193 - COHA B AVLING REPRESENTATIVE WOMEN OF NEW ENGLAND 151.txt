but lier energies required a more active life, and for several years she travelled through the Middle States, representing a Chicago firm, a cereal food house. Her salary, seventy-five dollars a month for the first two months, was then increased to three thousand dollars a year and expenses. In 1894 she married Arthur Putnam Ayling, a native of Boston, then a glass manufacturer in Milwaukee, Wis. She was elected treasurer of the company, the North- ern Glass W^orks, and had ]&gt;ractical charge of the office and sales ilepartment. In 1S98, her health failing, the Aylings moved to a delight- ful country house in Bridge water, Mass., where the rest and outdoor life proved restorative. Later, when her husband's business interests took him to the remote Southwest, Mrs. Ayling assumed the business management of a new Boston publication, the Brown Book, which in less than two years achieved a most remark- able success. She is also the presitlent of the Automatic Addressing Machine Company, and has interests in various other enterprises.

Personally Mrs. Ayling is a woman of rather slight physique, far too slight for the stress the mind would impose upon it; but her in- domitable will carries her through tasks that might well deter many men. Her rather quiz- zical gray eyes have an almost clairvoyant power in reatling those with whom she comes in contact. Her mind rapidly grasps the salient points of any proposition, ignoring unimpor- tant details, anil her deductions are seldom in error. She places her objective points clearly, and attains them by very direct meth- ods, possessing strong executive ability. She systematizes the work of her assistants, and inspires intense loyalty in those about her. Mrs. Ayling is a member of the New England Women's Press Club, and was a charter member of the Ousametiuin Club of Bridgewater.

MERCY A. BAILEY, art teacher, Boston, was born in the town of Wellfleet, on Cape Cod, Massachu- setts. Her parents were the Rev. Stephen Bailey, a native of Portsmouth, N.H., and his wife, Mrs. Sally Whitman Bailey, daughter of Dr. Jonas and Mercy (Goodspeed)

\\'liitnian, of Barnstable. Miss Bailey's maternal grandfather, Dr. Jonas Whitman (Yale Coll., 1772), was a descendant in the fifth genera- tion of JohnWhitman, an early settler of Wey- mouth, Mass., who, through his daughter Sarah, was an ancestor of President Abraham Lin- coln. The Whitman-Lincoln line is thus .shown: Sarah" Whitman, daughter of John,' married about 1653 Abraham Jones; and their daugh- ter, Sarah^ Jones, married Mordecai" Lincoln, of Hingham, from whom the line continued through Mordecai,^ born in 1686, who removed to New Jersey and later to Pennsylvania; John,^ who settled in Virginia; Abraham,^ who re- moved to Kentucky; to Thomas," father of Abraham,' the sixteenth President of the United States.

Miss Bailey was educateil in [jrivate schools in Boston and at Wheaton Seminary, in Norton, Mass. She remembers no time when she was not busy with pencil and brush. Even as a tiny child she thus rejjroduced the familiar objects about her. Her parents, recognizing her talent, wisely re.solved to have it properly developed; and accordingly she received the benefit of the best instruction from both native and foreign teachers, a part of her student days being spent in Lontlon anil Paris.
