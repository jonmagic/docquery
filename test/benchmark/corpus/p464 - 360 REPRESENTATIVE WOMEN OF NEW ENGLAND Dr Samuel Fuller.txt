Grace Atwood Pope was educated in private schools and at Bradford Academy. She early showed herself a lover of i)ooks and an original thinker, with a natural gift for composition. Her first article written for jiublication appeared in the Saturday Evening (lazctte when she was a girl of sixteen. After her marriage she re- sided by turns in the New Fjigland, Middle, and Southern States. But she did not din-ing these years lo.se her interest in educational matters, books, and book-makers.

Arriving in Boston from New Orleans a hnv years since, she .saw an advertisement calling for literary work, and, answ(&gt;ring it, .soon assumed regular duties upon The Writer. It was while .she was filling this position that .she was invited to become editor of a publication just then

coming into existence, The Brown Book. Declining a post which she felt involved too much responsibility, she consented to write for its pages, which she did for two years, only to become, at the end of that time, its assistant editor. In May, 1903, she was appointed editor of Modern Women, a monthly magazine devoted to woman's best interests, and whose special aims arc best set forth in Mrs. Pope's own words in the initial number, here cjuoted but in part: â€”

" Beginning with this issue, Modern Wome7i presents to you a new owner and a new editor, who beg for your gentle leniency toward their efforts to publish a magazine for the pleasure and profit of its subscribers. It opens its pages hospitably, and hopes to draw around it, both within and without, many women of many minds. It will be edited for women generally interested in affairs, topics of the home, handiwork, physical and beauty culture, literature, fiction, and humanity. . . .
