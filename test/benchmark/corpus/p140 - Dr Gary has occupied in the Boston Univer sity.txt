E FLORENCE BARKER, the first Pres- ident of the National Woman's Relief , Corps (elected in July, 1883), was for nearly a quarter of a century a resident of Maiden, Mass., where. .she died September 11, 1897. She was the daughter of William A. and Mary J. (Skinner) AVhittredge, was born in LynnfieUl, Mass., March 29, 1840, and was edu- cated in the public school of Lynnfield and at the academy in Thetford, Vt.

She was chosen Department President the following year, and filled the office so acceptably that she was re-elected in 1883.

Eighteen cor})s were instituted during her administration. While presiding over the State convention in Boston, January, 1883, she had the pleasure of welcoming Paul Van Der Voort, of Omaha, Neb., Commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, and other promi- nent comrades.
