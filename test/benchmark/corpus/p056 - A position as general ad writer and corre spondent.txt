A position as general ad writer and corre- spondent in the office of the C. F. David Adver- tising Agency, the original promoters of Profit- able Advertising, soon demonstrated her fitness for the editor's chair. In the course of a year or two she became the propiietor as well as the editor of the publication.

The story of Mi.ss Griswold's subsequent

career is simply the record of a shining success obtained slowly by the exercise of thoi^e quali- ties that alone can ensure fortune. The path has been hard and the difficulties unusual. Up to three years ago the editor as well as the manager of Profitable Advertising, Miss Griswold was especially handicapped by the very general doubt as to the practicability of the under- taking. When she began to edit Profitable Advertising, the number of women who were making a living in the advertising field could be counted on the fingers of one hand. They are now numbered by scores, and it is not too nmch to say that the single example c^f Miss Griswokl's grit and sagacity has hatl more to do with this than any other single cause.

Profitable Advertising is a periodical which stands for and reflects more than most publi- cations the individuality of its owner and man- ager. In this respect Miss Gri.swold deserves honorable mention in the same class with such representative American pul:)lishers as the Ben- netts of the Her&lt;dd, Dana of the Sun, and Horace Greeley of the Tribune. Iler publication has within tlie past three years attained high-water mark, and, as already intimated above, is rec- ognized by the leading authorities of two con- tinents as the model and standard of its class.

It is needless to add in words a personal trib- ute to such a record. Mi.ss Griswold numbers many friends in the publishing and advertising fields at large. She is a young woman whose powers have not yet touched their prime.

The ancestry of Miss Griswold has been traced back through various lines to conspicu- ous early colonists of her native State, she being also a "Mayflower" descendant, a double one, so to speak, deriving through both father and mother from William Bratlford, Governor of "Plymouth Plantation."

Her father, John Belden Griswold, was born in 1828, son of Josiah W^ells and Mary Ann (Belden) GriswoUl and a descendant in the eighth generation of Michael' Griswold, of Wethersfield. The line is: Michael'; Jacob,'^ born in 1660; Major Josiah,^ born in 1700; Josiah,''1728; Solomon,^ 1751 ; Josiah,^ 1775; Jo- siah Wells,' 1794; John Beklen,- Kate E. being of the ninth generation.

Mr. Griswold's paternal grandmother, the

wife of Josiah,' was Abigail Wells, daughter of Robert and Abigail (Hurlbut) Wells and grand- daughter of Lieutenant Robert and Abigail (Burnham) Wells, the Wells ancestry beginning ^\ith Thomas AVells (or Welles), one of the origi- nal proprietors of Hartford and Wethersfield, many years a magistrate and for two years CJov- ernor of the colony. Mrs. Al)igail Burnham Wells was a daughter of the Rev. William Burnham (William,' Thomns') and his wife Haimah, daughter of Samuel' \\'olcott, of Wind- sor. SamueP was grandson of I-Ienry' Wolcott, the founder of the distinguished family of this surname, prolific of governors.
