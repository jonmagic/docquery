nity for conference upon the work of the year, and the mutual interests of the two national organizations were considered by their leaders.

Through the courtesy of George S. Evans, Department Conmiander, national headquar- ters W. R. C. were established at the head- quarters of the Department of Massachusetts, G. A. R., in Pemberton Square, Boston.

To prove that a national order was needed, that the plan adopted at Denver was the best, and that women were capable of managing a large organization with ritualistic forms ami parliamentary rules, required excellent judg- ment, tact, and a love for the work. These qualities were combined in Mrs. Barker, who sought advice from the officials of the Grand Army of the Republic, and recognized the importance of harmonious co-operation with them.

In her first general order, dated September 1, 1883, she said: "While working in unison with the G. A. R., we can accomplish great results and build well the structure, which we hope will stand years after the watchful comrades have left — as they must — their unfinished work to our willing hands."

At the National Convention at Minneapolis in July, 1884, Mrs. Barker was able to say: "Our success far exceeds the high anticipations of our most sanguine friends." She wrote over a thousand letters during the year she served as National President, visited the De- partments of Maine, New Hampshire, and Con- necticut, and performed numerous other duties. She declined a re-election, but was made a life member of the National Executive Board, and until her ileath was a leader in the affairs of the order. A woman of commanding presence, always presiding with grace and dignity, Mrs. Barker was also an elocjuent speaker, and she addressed many patriotic gatherings in different parts of the coimtry. She represented the order at the International Council of Women held in Washington, D.C., in 1889, and favored progressive action when advocating the claims of woman's work for the veterans.

The National Woman's Relief Corps has re- ceived the cordial endorsement of every Na- tional Encampment since 1883, and is the only

recognized auxiliary to the GraiKl Army of the Republic. It is conducting a great work in every State and Territory of the Union, and numbers over one hundred forty thousand members. It has expended more than two million dollars in relief and many thousands of dollars additional in behalf of patriotic edu- cation in the public schools, in the erection of monuments and memorial halls, in the sacred observance of Memorial Day, in securing pen- sions for army nurses, and in other legislative work of importance.

A National AVoman's Relief Corps Home has been founded at Matlison, Ohio, for the wives and mothers of soldiers and for dependent army nurses ; and homes have also been founded and are being supported by the order in several States.

Mrs. Barker was deeply interested in the Soldiers' Home in Chelsea, Mass., and was one of the founders of the Ladies' Aid Ai?.sociation which co-operates with the Board of Trustees, of which Colonel Barker was treasurej. A room at the home, furnished by the Depart- ment of Massachusetts W. R. C, contains her portrait, and is designated by a banner with the inscription, "Dedicated in honor of Mrs. E. Florence Barker, first National President of the Woman's Relief Corps."
