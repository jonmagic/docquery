REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

iiig elocjuence of Theodore Parker, Mrs. Walton devoted herself to benevolent and philanthropic enterprises in her spare time, and was a leader in church and charitable work. During the Civil War, turning the sympathies of the Law- rence people toward the Sanitary Connnission, she aided in organizing the whole community into a body of co-laborers with the army in the field.

Having received thorough instruction in vocal culture from Professors James E. Mur- dock and William Russell, she was for years employed as a teacher of reading and vocal training in the teachers' institutes of Massa- chusetts. She also taught in the State Normal Institutes of Virginia, and for five successive years, by invitation of General Armstrong, conducted a teachers' institute of the gradu- ating class in Hampton. Her belief in the right of woman to be rated equally with man at her own worth and be credited with her own work was intensifietl by the decision of the publishers that her name should not appear witli her hus- band's on the title-page as co-author of the arithmetics which were their joint production, and led at length to earnest advocacy of equal rights for the sexes. She was always zealous in the temperance cause, and during a residence in Westfield was president of the local branch of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Since the removal of Mr. and Mrs. Walton to West Newton, where they now reside, Mrs. Walton has been active in promoting woman suffrage, believing that this will best advance the interests of temperance and kindred re- forms, and tend to the purification of politics. She was for many years an officer of the Massa- chusetts W^oman Suffrage Association, is a val- ued member anil vice-president of the New Eng- land Women's Club of lioston, for twenty years was president of the West Newton Women's Educational Club, organized in L8S0, and is now on the Boanl of Directors of the Woman's Club House Corporation. Although not a pro- lific writer, she sometimes contributes to the press. She is an interesting speaker and an occasional lecturer upon literary and philan- thropic subjects.

Peirce, wife of ex-Judge James R. Dunbar, of the Massachusetts Superior Court; Dr. George Lincoln Walton (Harv.
