MRS. LILLIAN M. N. STEVENS.— " As sweet and wholesome as her own ])iny wood" was Frances E. WiUard's epigrammatic description of the woman — above named — who succeeds her as leader of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union hosts. Mi,ss ^^'il!ard and Mrs. Stevens first met in 1875 at Old Orchard, Me., and the friendship there begun ripenetl into the deepest alTection as the years passed.

Mrs. Stevens was born in Maine, and her home has always been within the borders of that State. Her parents were Nathaniel and Nancy Fowler (Parsons) Ames. Her first pub- lic work was in the school-room as teacher, when she was Miss Ames. At the age of twenty- one she married Mr. M. Stevens, of Stroud- water, a charming suburb of Portland. Her husband is in full accord with her, and is one of the most genial of hosts to the multitude of her co-workers who are entertained in their hospitable home. Their only child, Mrs. Ger- trude Stevens Leavitt, is an ardent white rib- boner and one of the State super intenilents in the Maine W. C. T. U.

Mrs. Stevens possesses keen business ability and indomitable will power. She is a woman of culture, gentle in manner, and the embodi- ment of kindness.

The old home, which has been for a centur}' in the Stevens fainily, resounds constantly to the music of children's voices, for, although Mrs. Stevens has been prominently connected with the child-saving institution of her State, she believes most ardently that an institution can never be a substitute for a home; and, while she urges her Maine women to open their doors to Gotl's homeless little ones, she herself sets them a practical example.

Mrs. Stevens has been one of the prime movers in woman's temperance work ever since the historic crusade of 1873 in Hillsboro, Ohio. In 1874 she assisted in the organization of the W. C. T. U. in her native State. For three years she acted as treasurer, and she has since been continuously its president, unani- mously chosen. For thirteen years she was assistant recording secretary of the National W. C. T. U., for one year its secretary, and at the Cleveland convention in 1894 she was, on nomination of Miss Willard, elected vice- president-at-large of the National Union, suc- ceeding to the presidency in 1898.

Besides filling these offices and leading the women of Maine as president of the constantly growing State W. C. T. U., working and speak- ing for it untiringly, Mrs. Stevens has carried on a great amount of work connected with the charities of Maine, having been officially connected with several homes for the depend- ent classes. For years she has been the Maine representative in the National Conference of Charities and Correction. She was one of the lady managers of the World's Columbian Ex- position.

No woman in the organization which she leads is more loyal to its fundamental princi- ples. None possesses in a greater degree the confidence of its friends and the good will of its opponents than Mrs. Stevens, of Maine. Only those who best know her realize the depth of her religious nature. Her creed is truly the creed of love, her life one of peace and good will. Her Bible always lies close at hand vipon her desk, and .shows much reading. From the well-worn New Testament lying upon her couch we copied the.se words: "Tell our white ribboners to study the New Testament. I love the New Testament. No human being lias
