unwearied teacher, rarely eciualled in enthu- sia.sm and fitness for his vocation. Professor Agassiz, as everybody knows, had " no time to spare to make money." His salary, how- ever, fell far short of enabling him to meet both domestic and scientific expenses. Hence the establishment in 1855 (the idea originating with his wife) of the Agassiz School for young ladies, which had a prosperous existence of eight years, its pupils, attracted by the fame

of the great naturalist, coming from near and from far. The elder Agassiz children, Alexander and Ida, were helpers from the first. Mrs. Agassiz, who did not teach, held the responsi- ble ])osition of director, and had the general management of the school.

In the summer of 1859 Professor and Mrs. Agassiz enjoyed a trip to Europe, passing happy weeks with his mother and sister at Montagny, Switzerland. In April, 1865, they went to South America on the scientific ex- pedition whose history is recorded in the book entitled "A Journey in Brazil."

In December, 1871, they embarked on one of the vessels of the United States Coast Survey, the "Hassler," fitted out for deep-sea dredg- ing, which sailed through the Strait of Magel- lan and then northward along the Pacific coast to San Francisco, entering the Golden Gate August 24, 1872. During this voyage a journal of scientific and personal experience was kept by Mrs. Agassiz under her hu.^band's direction. A part of it was published in the Atlantic Monthly.

The eighth tlecade of the nineteenth century, which witnesses! in July, 187.3, the opening of the School of Natural History at Penikese, and in December following, the funeral of " the Master," was the decade in which a movement was made toward securing for women in Cam- bridge the real Harvard education or its equiv- alent. The initiative appears to have been or was taken by Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Gilman. A plan for instituting for women, outside the college, a tluplicate course of the Harvard in- struction was received with favor in December, 1878, by President Eliot and by some of the faculty who had been consulted. On February 22, 1879, was issued a circular headed "Private Collegiate Instruction for Women," setting forth the project. It was signed by Mrs. Louis Agassiz, Mrs. E. W. Gurney, Mrs. J. P. Cooke, Mrs. J. B. Greenough, Mrs. Arthur Gilman, Miss Alice M. Longfellow, Mrs. Lillian Horsford, and Arthur Gilman, secretary. Examinations for admission to the classes were held in Sep- tember, and work in the lecture room began at once. Twenty-five students completed the first year's course. On October 16, 1882, it having become necessary to raise a fund to

purchase the Fay House, the aljove-named ladies and others who had joined them legally became a corporation, with the title, "The Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women."

Ihider the popular name of "The Harvartl Annex," invented by one of its students, the institution grew and flourished. Twice was the Fay House enlargeil. In 1894, by act of the State Legislature, the name of The Society for the Collegiate Instruction of AVonien was changed to Radcliffe College, the bill receiving the signature of (ioveinor Greenhalge, March 23, 1894. It authorized Radcliffe to confer on women, with the ai)proval of the President and Fellows of Harvard, all honors and degrees as fully as any university or college in the Connnonwealth.
