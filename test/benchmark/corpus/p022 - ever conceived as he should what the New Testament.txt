ever conceived as he should what the New- Testament means by 'loyalty to Christ.' Among the last words spoken bv Miss Willard, February 13, 1898." " Loyalty to Christ " may well be calleil the keynote to Lillian Stevens's life, and more clearly than do most people she finds Christ always among "his brethren" in poor, sin-stained, sorely burdened humanity.

Mrs. Stevens has said that any written ac- count of her would have little meaning could there not be combineil with it a sketch of the organization which has meant so much to her in her life work. In fact, it was with this un- derstaniling that Mrs. Stevens consented to have a sketch of her' life prepared for this vol- ume.

Perhaps no question is asked more frequently than " What has the Woman's Christian Tem- perance Union done?" and few questions are more difficult to answer with any degree of satisfaction. This is not for lack of material, but rather becau.se of an over-abundance thereof. A few of the more general facts of its history may here be presented.

The National AVoman's Christian Temperance LTnion is the crystallized effort of the Women's Crusatle of 1873-74. It was organized in Cleveland, Ohio, November 18-20, 1874. Its characteristics are simplicity aiul unity, with emphasis upon individual responsibility. It is organized by State, district, county, and local unions. Every State and Territory in the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, has a State or Territorial union, and there is a beginning in the Philippine Islands. Ten thou- sand towns and cities have local unions.

Twenty-five national organizers, fourteen na- tional lecturers, and twenty-one national evan- gelists are constantly in the field, besides those of the several States and Territories. One thou- sand new unions were organized in 1900. One- fifth of all the States gained more than five hundred members over and above all losses in the year 1900.

Organization among the young women has grown into a branch, with its own general sec- retary and field workers. It is an integral part of the W. T. C. U., and is known as the Young Woman's ('hristian Temperance Union, or the Y. ^\^ C. T. U.

Organization of the children into Loyal Tem- perance Legions is also a branch, and numbers two hundred and fifty thousand Seniors and Juniors. Organization among colored people has secured nine separate State unions and many members. Organization among the Ind- ians is well begun in the Indian schools and among the more civilized adult Indian women. The department of organization among foreign- speaking people circulates literature in eighteen different languages, and keeps a missionary at the port of New York. It is not unusual for a national organizer to travel ten thousand miles m one year. This work is largely mis- sionary. In 1883 Miss Willard and Miss Gor- don visited every State and Territory in the l^nion, anil completetl an itinerary which in- cluded every city of ten thousand or more inhabitants by the census of 1870. Eight round-the-world missionaries have been sent by the National W. C. T. U.
