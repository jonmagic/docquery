BOSTON WOMEN'S EDUCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL UNION.— From the present plane of woman's activity in affairs it is difficult to appreciate the courage and prescience of a small band of women who in 1877, under the leadership of Dr. Harriet Clisby, organized the Boston Women's Educational and Industrial Union " for the purpose of increasing fellowship among women in order to promote their educational, industrial, and social advancement." Dr. Harriet Clisby was elected President, Miss M. Chamberlin Secretary, and Mrs. S. E. Eaton Treasurer. These officers, with four directors, adopted a constitution whose foimdation was so broad and deep that during the past quarter of a century the Ihiion has always found an open door for any work that "advanced the Interests of women."

"A union of all for the good of all," there was in its inception a deep vein of ethical pur- pose, a tremendous initial impulse of faith, religious fervor, and enthusiasm. It was born in the days of few organizations and of limited opportunities for women. The force of self- expression was beginning to stir, but had to force its way against the inertia of conserva- tism.

In the faith of the founders of the Union appeared a regenerating force to touch the commimity to higher life. The Union came

into the world hampered by no preconceived methods for future development: it simply stood ready to respond to the opportunity for service. This very lack of definiteness, this plastic form, was at the outset, and con- tinues to be, a source of strength, insuring a sensitive response to the needs of the hour.

Constant through all these years, the Union's ideal has been the uplift of women through the character-building forces of association and re- sponsibility; throvigh the inspiration and privi- lege of service.

"The Union aspires to be that common meeting-place where every woman stands on the same level, and must therefore look straight into the eyes of every other woman, seeing the essential thing — character apart from material or social conditions — a ground so level that there can be no looking up or looking down, where the permanent bond is that spiritual one which blesses him who gives and him who takes."

The successful progress of the Union has been uniform. While rich only in ideals, its financial credit was early secured by a rigid adherence to a very primitive rule of " keeping absolutely out of debt." The Union has never asked help to meet an obligation already in- curred.

At the outset the work itself, not yet grown to unwieldy proportions, was well adapted to claim the interest of volunteer committees, whose living spirit and enthusiasm in those early days was priceless; and they accom- plished what paifl workers, untouched by their tire, could never have done, in laying for the l^nion deep and lasting foundations.

The magnitiide of the changes in conditions which have necessitated changes in methods is indicated in the following figures: In 1879 the assets of the Union were about one hundred dollars, with no paid workers. In 1904 the assets are two hundred and fifteen thousand, five hundred and eighteen dollars, with a pay- roll of one hundred and one. In the In- dustrial Departments alone the change is enormous. To-day (1904) the Union presents the unique spectacle of a business that em- ploys about seventy-five paid workers, with annual receipts of one hvmdred and twenty-
