Her magazine stories — many under the pseu- donym " B. E. E." — have a grace ami tender- ness which are apt to send one back for sec- ond reading. Her biographies of Washington, Grant, Ciarfield, and Oliver Wendell Holmes are in steady demand. "Huldah," her book of patriotic verse, dedicated to a member of the I). A. R., is read with appreciation by lovers of graceful poetry. To change slightly the author's own lines about another, it may well be said that Miss Brown, "among New Ham])shire's daughters, stanch and strong, has made her name well known, both for her story and her song."

As described by a friend, Miss Brown's i)er- sonality is graceful and charming. The eyes are remarkable — deep as the violets she so beautifully paints, with long dark lashes. Her presence diffuses swfH'tness and strength, and to have met her once is to always long to know her more intimately.

Not over robust, Mi.ss Brown is unable to keep as busy as her ambition would direct. The demand for her charming water-colors exceeds the supply. At her exhibition a year

ago the favorite pictures were scenes at the Azores, where Mi.ss Brown has passed much vacation time. This year (1903) she has busily sketched along the Massachusetts coast. Few, indeed, are they who can depict life in two ways, on glowing canvas and printed page; but Miss Brown holds the secret of both arts.
