Emma Huntington (as her name stands on the school catalogues) was educated at the Hallowell Academy and at the Maine Wes- leyan College at Kent's Hill, where she was graduated A.B. in 1865, that institution lieing then the only one in New England which offered a regular college course for women. In

187U she was marrietl to Mr. Charles H. Nason, of Augusta, an enterprising and success- ful bu.siness man of refined and cultivated tastes.

She began at an early age to write verses. Her first publisheil writings appeared in the Portland Transcript under a pen-name, and consisted of short stories, translations from the German, and verses, which are still favorably noticed. In 1875 she gave the connnencement poem before the literary societies of her Alma Mater, and on Marcli 9, 1880, she read an original poem at the dedi- cation of the beautiful building, which was the gift of the citizens of Hallowell to its old and honored institution, the Hallowell Social Library. This large and well-selected collec- tion of books, to which Mrs. Nason had access from childhood, and to the influence of which may be ascribed the literary culture of her native town, she still holds in grateful re- membrance. The poem, with the oration delivereil at the same time, was published in a dainty souvenir volume.

Her first poem published under her own name was "The Tower," which appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, May, 1874, and won ready recognition. Her pen, which since that time has seklom been idle, was busied chiefly for some years with .songs of child life, which appeannl at intervals in such magazines as St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, antl Our Little Ones. In 1888 these were collected in a volume called "White Sails," a title who.se tender fitness is told in its prelude. These verses are familiar in .scliool-i-ooms throughout the country. One in particular, "The Bravest Boy in Town," tells an incident of the Civil War, and is everywhere a favorite. "The Mission Tea Party" gives a pathetic incident in the siege of Lucknow. "The Bishop's Visit," "A Little Girl Lost," " Unter tlen Linden," "Saint Olga's Bell," and the "Battl(&gt; Song" have been widely copied and used as recitations. It gives Mrs. Nason the greatest pleasure that children have loved and learned her ver.ses.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Literary World: " Emma Huntington Nason is one of those wlio write verses by divine permission. Her poems are not 'merely per- sonal outpourings of joy or sadness, but they are thoughtful with the insight that looks into others' experiences as her own. 'The Ballad of the Blithe Quartette,' with its mingled nmsic, the gently swinging 'Slumber Song," the dignified 'The Tower,' which begins the book, and the reverently passionate ' At- tainment,' which closes it, are widely different from each other in form as in spirit, but they are all gootl and true, and we are glail they are ours to read and keep."
