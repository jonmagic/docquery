In LS89 Miss Brown was the chief clerk of the Constitutional Prohibitory Amendment Campaign Committee (of which Colonel Ed- ward H. Haskell, of Newton, was chairman), having charge of the correspondence and the assignment of the speakers. The campaign was one of the memorable ones of the Common- wealth, and her abihty and untiring persever- ance were amply demonstrated in connection wkth her part in it.

About twelve years ago Miss Brown began her career at the State House. At first she did not like the work, owing to the publicity it entailed, but under the guidance of Mr. Faxon she soon became familiar with the details of legislative routine. The universal courtesy

shown her, and the assistance accorded bj' the members of the General Court, are impor- tant factors in her legislative successes; and to-day there is not a person on Beacon Hill whose advice in coimection with temperance legislation is so much sought as the woman upon whose shoulders has fallen the mantle of the renowned Hemy H. Faxon, and no one, it may be atlded, enjoys greater confidence. P'or the past six years Miss Brown has been Mr. Faxon's sole representative at the State House, where she passes a great deal of time during the legislative sessions, looking after the different bills affecting the liquor question, the Sunday laws, ami other subjects in which Mr. Faxon has always taken a great interest. Miss Brown enjoys the distinction of being the only woman in New England who is reg- istered as legislative agent and counsel. The authority thus conferred entitles her to the privileges of conducting hearings before the various committees and of cross-examining wit- nesses. In LS96 she conducted one of the most important hearings ever held at the State House, when the bill authorizing the payment to the State of the entire sum received as fees from liquor licenses was being considered.

The temperance forces all over the Connnon- wealth owe her a debt of gratitude for the effi- cient manner in which she has labored for the protection of the restrictive features of the laws regulating the sale of intoxicating licjuors. Her able efforts which accomplished the defeat of the "abutters'" law every year and the famous semi-colon law are well known. Some of the most important statutes of a prohib- itive character that have been passed owing chiefly to her work and influence are those which compel the closing of the saloons on all legal holidays, the so-called Faxon Express Law, and several others restricting the sale of liquor by druggists. All of these laws she personally fonnulated and fought for until their passage was secured.

The correspondence of the Faxon Political Temperance Bureau, of which Miss Brown is now the sok' manager, is almost unlimited, and covers more phases of the reform than that of any other temperance society. She is in constant communication with munici-

pal officers and citizens interested in the en- forcement of the laws, and is always found willing and ready in furnishing information and helping to solve tlieir local problems. It is no exaggeration to say that she has the necessary authorities at her finger tijjs, and her advice proves to be of inestimable value in such cases.
