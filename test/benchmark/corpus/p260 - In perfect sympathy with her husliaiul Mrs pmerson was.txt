In perfect sympathy with her husliaiul, Mrs. p]merson was of invaluable lielp to him in all his intellectual ami spiritual work. After his death, in 1S85, she taught school for several years in Reading, Monson, Somerville, and in the day and evening schools of lioston-. In 1897 she was graduated from the Emerson College of Oratory, Boston, and in 1900 she accepted her present position as prece])tress of Emerson College.

Mrs. Emerson's character is marked by high ideals and quiet but persistent aspiration. From her father and grandfather she inherits that faculty of judgment which enables her ([uickly to read individual character, a calm manner and firm will, with executive ability, througii which slie has handled many a diffi- cult situation without friction or injustice, as plainly shown in her tliscipline in the granmiar schools in which she taught. In her present position she has made herself both respected and loved, and is consistently known for the tonic quality of her sympathy, which holds the young people always to fheir best. Two other characteristics have helped to make her the confidante of young and okl â€” the ability tf) keep a secret and her care not to give unsought advice. While she never fails to speak to the point when she does speak, it is often laugh- ingly said of her that "she knows how to keep silent in seven languages." Like many other reserved people, she writes more easily than she talks. When time jjermits, she lectures on subjects connected with elocution and I)hysical culture, and writes short stories.

Mrs. Emerson's modest reserve, coupled with a natural tlignity, might give a stranger the impression that she is possessed of a cold and indifferent nature, but this impression is dissipated by a glance at the merry eye and kindly mouth, even before one comes to note her many kindnesses.

Physically sturdy and active, intellectually keen and progre.ssive, and spiritually wholesome and sweet, she is a type of the best product of

New England womanhood, fostered by plain living and high thinking.
