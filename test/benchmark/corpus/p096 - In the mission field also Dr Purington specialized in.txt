To that teacher, Ann Eliza Fritcher, afterward a missionary under the American Board, founder and long-time principal of the Girls' School at Marsovaii, Turkey, Dr. Puring- ton feels the deepest spiritual obligation.

Life, almost all life, has its tragic side. This one was not exempt. A nervous breakdown came, the consequence of anxiety and over- work; and for two years or more there was a physical, mental, and spiritual " walk in the dark with God." The (lisability had its com- pensations in a long residence at Clifton Springs Sanitarium and the help and blessing of Dr. Henry Foster. Out of pathos unspeakable, disaster, and defeat, came a knowledge of things unseen and eternal, and a buoyant faith in God that has been the mightiest factor in Dr. Pur- ington's spiritual life. A gradual restoration was followed by change of scene and surround- ings and a new home in the serener atmosphere of Boston. With Miss P'dla Gilbert Ives, the friend who is one with her in motive, interest, and aim. Dr. Purington has been associated since 1885 in a school for girls, at the same time giving herself without stint to philan- thropic work. For ten years she has held an influential position in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, nmning the gamut of local and county president, local. State, and national superintendent, and of late editor of the State paper. She served several years as national superintendent of franchise, and com- piled for Miss Willard the facts used by her in her annual addresses to exhibit the progress of women. In 1895 Dr. Purington was trans- ferred to the department of health antl he- redity, which, as national superintendent, she has thoroughly organized and developed, rally- ing to her a,ssistance State superintendents and a host of earnest workers in her great con- stituency.

The aim of her department is the develop- ment of the highest life, physical, mental, and spiritual, and not only this, but also the clean- est, healthiest civic life. It includes co-opera- tion with boards of health in the enforcement

of health ordinances; school hygiene and sani- tation, instruction in the laws of health in re- lation to dress, food, air, exercise, cleanliness, mental and moral hygiene. The department is active in trying to secure the passage of pure food bills, legislative enactments relating to public health, milk and poultry inspection, etc., all of which work covers a wide field of en- deavor, and is attended year by year with in- creasingly good results.
