A part of her address relatetl to the National Woman's Relief Corps Home, of which she spoke in congratulatory terms, as follows : " This first year in the history of our National W. R. C. Home has been one of unwonted prosperity and success. The sympathy and co-operation of the people have been expressed in every po.ssible manner, and their gifts for its equip- ment and support have been generous even to lavishness. ... A most princely gift is the ap- propriation by the Ohio Legislature of twenty- five thousand dollars for the erection of a cot-- tage upon the home grounds. We asked for twenty-five hundretl dollars, and the State gave us twenty-five thousand dollars. This is

the highest recognition of the Woman's Relief Corps and its work that has ever been given, and is truly a crown of glory to this adminis- tration and the seal of future possibilities." Quoting from the report of the Invalid Pension Committee of Congress, to whom the bill for pensions for army nurses had been referred, she continued : " I trust the work of securing special pensions will he pushed to the utmost. The greatest obstacle in the way seems to be the defective record of army nurses in the War Department. Twenty-six thousand names of women are enrolled. Eighteen thousand of them have no record whatever. Six thousand two hundred and. eighty-one are mentioned as army nurses, but four thousand six hundred and ninety-four of these have no statement as to the authority by which they were appointed. It is not probable that Congress will pass a general pension law for army nurses until a satisfactory record is made. Therefore I be- lieve it is of the utmost importance that this record of the W\ar Department be corrected and, if possible, completed. This will require a vast amount of time, patience, work, and in- fluence, an immense correspondence, and some money. But the women who served their country amid the i)erils of war deserve some- thing at our hands; and, if we cannot secure for them pensions while living, let us build for them a monument of tleeds, recorded in the military register of the nation. Many, very many of them are dead. All will soon be gone. Then let us not allow their heroic services to sink into oblivion, but take immediate action toward the accomplishment of this work."

In closing her address, Mrs. McHenry pre- sented several recommendations of value to the work, and expressed thanks to many friends for courtesies received.

On motion of Mrs. Kate B. Sherwood, past National President, the convention extended thanks to Mrs. McHenry "for her exemplifi- cation of all the womanly qualities enjoined by the obligations of our order while presiding over this convention." Mrs. McHenry re- sponded: "Ladies, I thank you. Time is too precious for me to use it in telling of my ap- preciation of all the kind things you have said and done for me, not only here in convention.
