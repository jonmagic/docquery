While teaching at Canajoharie, Miss Anthony .served as secretary of the local society of the Daughters of Temperance; and at a supper on March 1, 1849, to which they invited the people of the village, she made the ])rincipal address, reading it from her manuscript. It was her first platform utterance.

the New York Tribune reports of a similar convention in Worcester, Mass., October, 1850, Miss Anthony " sympathized fully with the demand for equal rights for women, but was not yet (juite convinced that these included the suffrage."

In 1S51 , as the president of a lotlge of Daugh- ters of Temperance in Rochester, she was very active in raising funds and organizing societies to carry on temperance work, and there "first &lt;lisplayed that executive ability which was destined to make her famous." Attending in that winter an anti-slavery meeting conducted by Stephen and Abby Kelley Foster, she was so much interested that she accompanied them for a week in their lecturing toiu'. In the fol- lowing May she first met I'^^lizabeth Cady .Stan- ton, who afterward said of her, "I liked her thoroughly from the beginning."

At the first annual meeting of the Woman's State Temperance Society, held in Rochester in June, ISS;^, Miss Anthony was re-elected secretary, but refused to serve, stating that

" the vote showed they would not accept the principle of woman's rights, and, as she be- lieved thoroughly in standing for the equal- ity of woman, she would not act as officer of such a society. . . .
