The Rev. Arthur W. H. Eaton says: "David Hamilton was undoubtedly born in Scotland, and most likely belonged to the Westburn Hamiltons. This, I think, is almost certain, since he named one of his sons Gabriel, a name which never occurs in Scotland, so far as I know, except in the Westburn family. . . . Westburn is in the barony and jxu-ish of Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland. William Hamilton, of Wishaw, wrote in 1710: ' Westburn was lately fewed out by the Duchess of Hamil- ton to Hamilton of Westburn. It is a pleasant house upon the river with good gardens.'"

The Westburn Hamiltons were an old and distinguished branch of the family of the Duke of Hamilton, having sprung from Thomas of Darngabar, third son of the first Duke of Hamilton. (Burke's "Landed Gentry.")

David Hamilton married at Saco, Me., in 1662, Anna Jackson. From the journal of the Rev. John Pike it is learned that David Hamilton and others were killed by the Ind- ians at Newichwannock (Berwick), September 28, 1691. His sons were: David, Solomon, Gabriel, Jonathan, Abel, Jonas, Abiel, James.

Abiel Hamilton was born probal)ly about 16SU, but whether in Kittery or Dover has not been ascertained. As shown by the Ber- wick town records and York Deeds, he owned nuich land in Kittery, possessing large tracts situated on both sides of Salmon Falls, on Little River, near Love's Brook, ami near Doughty's Falls. He received two pounds, ten shillings, February 9, 1712, "for going ex])ress to Boston last fall and ye service of ye parish." He was grand juryman March 15, 1713-4; constable, DecembcT 23, 1717; and petit juryman, June 16, 1718.

Records of the First Church of Berwick give the following: " Bial Hamilton, member May 24, 1719; dismissed to Upper Church." On the parish rate, Berwick, September 29, 1752, he is taxed fifteen shillings, ten pence.

Abiel' Hamilton married Abigail Hodgdon, December 26, 1721, she being his second or thinl wife. He had about fifteen children, one of whom, and the next in this line of descent, was named Solomon. Abiel Ham- ilton died between March 9, 1758, the date of his will, and January 31, 1763, when it was proved. He devises to wife Abigail one half of the homestead during her life; to sons Jonas and Solomon, the homestead, house, barn, orchard, and so forth.

Solomon Hamilton, son of Abiel and Al)i- gail, was baptized August 19, 1733, at the First Church in Berwick. He married twice, and was survivetl by his second wife, Eliza- beth Pearce. Previous to March 23, 1778, they signed a deed to Joseph Chadbourne, Jr., of land in Scjuth Berwick, near Love's Brook, on the roatl to Doughty's Falls. S(jlomon Hamilton died between April 9 and June 24, 1794. In his will he gave to his wife Eliza- beth, whom he made executrix, the improve- ment of all his estate in Berwick during her natural life, and directed that his son Daniel, the seventh of his eight children, should re- ceive five pounds, five shillings, on arriving at the age of twenty-one.
