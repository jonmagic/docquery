She was educated at a private school in Gloucester ami at Abbot Academy, Andover, Mass., where she was a student, boarding at Smith Hall, for three years, 1856-58. In her first year the principal of the academy was Maria Brown; in her second and third, Enmia L. Taylor, sister to Samuel Taylor, LL.D., of Phillips Andover Academy. One of her class- mates and chums was "Georgie" Stowe (young- est daughter of the author of " Uncle Tom's Cabin," then residing in Andover), a slender, fair-haired, attractive girl, "looking," it was said, "so much like Eva!" in her mother's famous story, but whose (assumedly) naive drolleries rather suggested the character of Topsy. Another fellow-pupil at the academy for a short time was Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, of whom it is remembered that her very early school-girl compositions, while always pre- pared with neatness and care, gave no evidence of unusual literary ability.

On account of the serious illness of her mother, Mrs. Sarah Stanwood Lowe, Mary left the acad- emy in 1858, without completing the full course of study, as she otherwise would have done. Mrs. Lowe died September 4, 1862. She was a daughter of Captain Theodore Stanwood, of Gloucester, and sister to Amelia Stanwood, the wife of the Rev. Andrew Bigelow, D.D.

John Woodward Lowe, a native of Ipswich, Mass., was for many years a merchant in Gloucester and a highly esteemed citizen. He died in 1867.

On the 22d of March, 1864, Marj' J. Lowe was married to Charles Edward Parkhurst, son of Charles and Elizabeth (Andrews) Parkhurst. Mr. Parkhurst is a prosperous business man of Gloucester, being a proprietor of marine rail- ways. He is a member of the Indepenilent Order of Odd Fellows. Mr. and Mrs. Parkhurst have one daughter, Mamie Bessie. She was educated in the public schools of Gloucester, and in recent years has travelled extensively with her mother. Mamie B. Paikhurst is a member of Lucy Knox Chapter, Daughters of the Revolution.

Mrs. Parkhurst has been a member of Colonel Allen Relief Corps, No. 77, auxiliary to the

Colonel Allen Post, No. 45, G. A. R., of Glouces- ter, since December, 1886, when the corps was organized.

She has held various positions of responsi- bility in the corps, and in 1894 was elected president, performing the various duties of that office with efficiency. The office of de- partment aide has several times been conferred upon her by tlepartment presidents; and she has also been an assistant inspector, serving in that official capacity in Ipswich, Salem, and Danvers. In 1899 she was department press correspondent for the National Tribune. She has written many articles for the papers. Mrs. Parkhurst has attended nearly all the State conventions of the AVoman's Relief Corps during the past fifteen years, and has served in official positions antl on committees during the ses- sions. She has several times been elected a delegate by the Department of Massachusetts, W. R. C, to national conventions of the order: and she was a participant in the national con- vention held at Indianapolis, Ind., in 1893, at the one held the following year in Pittsburg, Pa., also at Louisville, Ky., in 1895, at St. Paul, Minn., in 1896, and at Chicago, 111., in 1900. In February, 1903, she was elected a delegate to the national convention in August, 1903, in California. On account of illness she was unable to attend that convention. Referring to her patriotic work, she says, "My interest in the soldiers' cause is unabated."
