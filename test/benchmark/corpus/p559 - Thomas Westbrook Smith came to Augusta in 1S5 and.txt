Thomas Westbrook Smith came to Augusta in 1S()5, and for fifty years was one of the lead- ing business men of that city. He died in March, 1855. His wife was Abigail Page. They had one son, Henry R. Smith. Their j'oungest child, Elizabeth Westbrook, died in infancy. Kliza Ann, the only surviving daugh- ter, was married November 25, 1834, before she was twenty years of age, to the Hon. James AVare Bradltury, who was twelve years her senior. For a long period Mr. Bradbury was one of the leading members of the Kennebec County bar. I'^lected United States Senator in 1846, he ser\(&gt;(l in Congress through the term ending March 4, 1853. Two of the four sons born to Mr. and Mrs. Bradbury died liefore th(nr mother, an affliction from which she never &lt;(uite rallied. Mrs. Bradbury died January 29, 1879. Her memory was always very pre- cious to her husband. Nothing seemed to please him more than to have a sympathetic listener while he recounted tlie many pleasant reminiscences of his happy married life. The anniversary evenings of their marriage were always sacred to him. He would watch the clock (which had stood in the corner of the

library for more than sixty years) and tell those who were gathered aronnd him the exact moment when the ceremony began. The mem- ory of his wife seemed to keep Mr. Bradbury bright for the more than score of years that he survived her. "To live in the hearts we leave behind is not to die." He -died January 6, 1901, full of years and full of honors. He was born June 10, 1802.

Mr. Bradbury, like a wise man, always de- ferred to his wife in hou.?ehokl matters, saying: "It relieves me of great responsibility. My wife is more fitted than I am for it." And cer- tainly Mrs. Bradbury had great business ca- pacity, possessing unconunon executive abil- ity, which she inherited from her father, a man of strong will, great industry, sterling sense, and correct judgment. She inherited much property from her father and from her only brother (Henry R. Smith, who died in March, 1876); and, being always self-reliant, she en- joyed the management of it. Sympathetic and full of energy, she was active in works of benevolence, and had great tact and power in bringing others to co-operate in carrying them forward. Much of her income was used in alleviating the sufferings of the poor and needy, who found in her a warm friend. One of her favorite charities was the Old Ladies' Home of Augvista, of which at the tinie of her death she wa3Â»-president. Many gifts from other hands were the result of her persuasive efforts. In her will she left to this home a generous bequest and also one to the (ieneral Hospital at Portland for a free bed, also dona- tions to the Howard Benevolent Society" and the Episcopal (kiild of Augusta.

Mrs. Bradbury always enjoyed society, and with her husband helil m^iy pleasant recep- tions at their home. During Mr. Bradbury's senatorship she always accom{)anietl him to Washington, where she derived nuicli satis- faction from her increased social activities.
