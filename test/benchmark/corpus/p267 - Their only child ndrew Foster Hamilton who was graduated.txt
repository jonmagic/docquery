Their only child, .\ndrew Foster Hamilton, who was graduated from Amherst College in 1901, entered the Law School of Harvard University in 1902.

Mrs. Hamilton is a registered voter on school matters in Athol, though feeling that the slight privilege thus accphred is little more than a farce. She was converted to belief in equal suffrage by lier husl)an(l, and is a stanch Re- publican in politics, but not naturally an ag- gressive suffragist.

Mr. Hamilton was clerk for a merchant who left his business with his employees to serve in the Civil War. He was impressed with the spirit and lessons of the conflict, and his a.ssociate membership in Post No. 140, Ci. A. R., attests his desire to perpetuate its lessons. Mr. Hamilton has been a director of the Athol Young Men's Christian Associa- tion from its organization, having also served as president and treasurer. He is a member of the Pocpiaig Clul); a Past Orand of Tully Lodge, No. 130, I. O. O. F., which he has served many terms as Chajilain; a Past High Priest of Mount Pleasant Encampment, No. 68; member of Canton Athol, P. M., and of Banner Lodge, No. 89, D. of R. ; and for thirty years has taken an active interest in local public affairs. He has been a fre(]uent con- tributor to the local ])ress, and his letters to the Sprinyficld Repuhlimn in support of the administrative policies of Presidents McKin- ley and Roosevelt have elicited much com- ment and some interesting private correspond-

ence. He is also an occusiunal writer of verse, his "Tribute to AVilliani McKinley" having brought to hiiu many letters of appreciation, incluiling acknowleilginents from Mrs. Mc- Kinley, President Roosevelt, and the Depart- ment of State. Mr. Hamilton's motto govern- ing all writings for the iniblic eye is, "To do somel)ody or some cause some good." In the family life of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton inde- pendence of thought has been sacredly re- specteil, but, happily, there has been har- mony and mutual helpfulness.

EMMA HUNTINGTON NASON, author and nuisical composer, is a native of Hallowell, Me., a pleasant town on the Kennebec, which is rich in local and historic interest. She was born August 6, 1845, the daughter of Sanuiel W. and Sally (Mayo) Huntington. The Huntington family in America, to which her fathe'r belonged, was first represented in New England i)y the widow Margaret Huntington, who came from England with her children (her husband having died on the voyage) in 1633, as certified by the church records of Roxbury. This family has counted among its members many dis- tinguished men: one was a signer of the Dec- laration of Independence: another, one of Gen- eral Washington's staff: and in U\ter genera- tions some of them have been well known as artists, writers, lawyers, and divines.

Mrs. Nason's maternal gi-andfathcr was a lineal descendant of the Rev. John Mayo, who was ordained in 1655 as the first pastor of the Second Church of Boston, where he preached for seventeen years, and who built the old historic Mayo-Mather house on Hanover Street in 1665. Mrs. Nason is also descended in several lines from "Mayflower" Pilgrims antl other ancestors who bore their part in early colonial history.
