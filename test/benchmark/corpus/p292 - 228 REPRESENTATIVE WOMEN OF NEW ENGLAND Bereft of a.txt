REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Bereft of a mother's loving care at the age of six years, Dora Basconi early learned lessons of self-reliance and of unselfishness and us(&gt;ful- ness to those around her. She was educateil al Townsend Female Seminary, and at the age of sixteen she entered her father's counting- room, where she filled the position of hook- keeper and confidential clerk until her mar- riage. To that period, with its varied ex- periences, she is indebted for her broad and practical views of life. It is a mistaken idea that business development in woman blunts her finer sensibilities: the opposite is the truth. Like a ))lant whose blossoms are cut freely, human nature repays in richness and fruitful- ness for all drafts properly made on its re- sources; and a woman who has become |)unc- tilious in business detail has learned to solve many problems in profit and loss, eciuity, jus- tice, that must be encountered and .wived in the same punctilious way in daily life. Dora Bascom, while in her father's business office, came in contact with many people, and her philanthropic spirit early manifested itself in kindly ministrations to the poor and sick of the village. When the Civil War broke out, and the Sanitary Commission was formed in June, 1861, she joined the ranks of devoted patriotic women, and worked early and late for relief of the " boj's in blue."

She was married November 27, 1862, to Samuel Garfield Smith, a well-known watch- maker of Boston. Two children, Kate Auzella and Dexter Munroe, blessed this happy union.

Kate Auzella Smith was married April 23, 1889, to Charles Sunmer Waterhouse. They live in Brookline, Mass., and have one child, a daughter named Irma. Mrs. Waterhouse is a well-known whist teacher.

Dexter Munroe Smith, broker, was for fifteen years in the employ of F. H. Prince &amp; Co., Boston. He married December 19, 1894, Anna Cogswell, of Ipswich, Mass., where they now reside. They have two children, Helen C. and Julian D.

Mrs. Smith was one of the earliest meml)ers of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union of Boston, and for many years served on important committees. She was influential in agitating the (juestion of the placing of ma-

trons in the police ;?i.ations. She was a charter member of the New Eilgland Helping Hand Society and was on its Board of Government for several years. This opened to her numerous opportunities for quiet, unostentatious charity. Many a wronged girl has reason to bless her for pecuniary help as well as kindly sympathy.

She was on one of the committees of the fair for Mrs. Charpiot's Home for Intemperate Women, by which thirteen thousand dollars was raised. These committees conceived the idea of forming the Woman's Charity Club of Boston. Mrs. Smith was one of the organizers thereof and its first hospital treasurer, holding the position five years, until obliged to resign by a protracted illness. She served for six years as first vice-president of the club.
