Mrs. Littlehale's maternal grandparents were Lieutenant Retire H. and Ednah (Hardy) Parker, of East Bradford, now Groveland, Mass. The Parker line of ancestry began with Abraham' Parker, who married at Woburn in 1644 Rose Whitlock, and about the year 1653 removed to Chelmsford. It continued through Abraham,^ who married Martha Liver- more and settled in East Bradford; Abrahanr' antl wife, Elizal)eth Bradstreet (a descendant of Humphrey Bradstreet, of Rowley) ; Abi-a- ham* and his second wife, Hannah Beckett, daughter of Retire Beckett, of Salem, belonging to a noted family of ship-builders; to Lieutenant Retire H. Parker and his wife, Ednah Hardy, above named.

Martha Livermore, wife of Abraham^ Parker, of East Bradford, was a daughter of John Liver- more, of Watertown (the founder of the family of this name in New England), and his wife Grace (born Sherman), whom he married in England, and who was closely related to the immigrant progenitors of the most prominent Sherman families of America. Mrs. Grace Sherman Livermore was a useful member of the colony, being an obstetrician. She sur- vived her husl)and, and died in Chelmsford in 1690, aged seventy-five years (gravestone).

Judging from printed records, the name Ed- nah has come down to Mrs. Cheney not only from her mother, her grandmother Dow, and her great-grandmother Parker, but from a more remote ancestress, Mrs. Ednah Bailey, wife of Richard' Bailey, o-'" Rowley, Mass. Tracing

backward, we find that Mrs. Ednah Hardy Parker, born in 1745, was the daughter of Cap- tain EHphalef and Hannah (Platts) Hardy, grand-daughter of Jonas Platts and his wife, Anne' Bailey, and great-grand-daughter of Deacon Joseph^ Bailey, of East Bradford, who was son of Richard' and his wife Ednah. Richard Bailey was one of the company that set up in Rowley the first cloth-mill in America. Mrs. Ednah Bailey's maiden name is thought to have been Halstead.

Mrs. Cheney's birthplace was on Belknap Street, now Joy, about half-way up Beacon Hill from Cambridge Street. She was the third chikl born to her parents. Five children came after her, one a little brother; but only four — Ednah and three sisters, one a lifelong invalid — lived to adult age. When she was two years old, the family removed to Hayward Place, and six years later they took up their abode in a new house on Bowdoin Street. At the first school she attended, kept by the Misses Pem- berton, she had gootl training in reatling, spell- ing, arithmetic, grammar, anil geography. The second was Mr. William B. P^owle's Monitorial School, which she entered with her elder sister, Mary Frances. Here she distinguished herself by her knowledge of grannnar, as shown by her skill in "parsing," antl her ready recitations in other studies that interested her, one of these being French, which was especially well taught. The attraction of a new and friendly acquaint- ance, Miss Caroline Healey, drew her to the school on Mount Vernon Street of Mr. Joseph H. Abbot. For a few terms she continued to advance in various ways of learning, more or less pleasurable, in the meantime successfully cultivating independence of thought, till, feel- ing her-self not in harmony with the constituted authorities, she was as anxious to leave the Abbot school as she had been to enter it. Here ended her school-days — education still to be won. The home atmosphere was favorable to mental growth. Love of learning, with a taste for good literature, was an inheritance. The mother, "a beautiful type of woman, of good practical ability and great tenderness of heart, was very fond of reading." "Indeed," says Mrs. Cheney, " I can never remember seeing either her or my father sitting down to rest
