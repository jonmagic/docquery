Their daughter, Lydia Ann (now Mrs. Wellington), whose birth date is given above, was educated at the Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Mass. On September 18, 1866, she was married to Gen- eral Arthur Augustus Goodell, of Worcester, a veteran of the Civil War. She became the mother of four children: Harry Barton, born August 13, 1867; Edwin Wilder, born March 15, 1869, who died February 4, 1890; Alice May, born May 1, 1871; and Edwin Howe, born February 8, 1873, who died in infancy.

On September 4, 1883, Mrs. Goodell became the wife of Fred Williams Wellington, who in former years had been connected in business with General Goodell. Mr. Wellington was born in Shirley, Mass., May 31, 1851, son of Timothy W. and Augusta (Fiske) Wellington and a lineal descendant in the eighth genera- tion of Roger Wellington, one of the early proprietors of Watertown, Mass.

One year after his return from Europe he was clerk in the First National

Bank, Worcester, and later he was in his father's coal office. The year 1871 he passed in California. He embarked in the coal busi- ness in 1872, anil is still in the trade, having been since 1889 president and general manager of the Austin C. Wellington Coal Company.

He served on the staff of Governors Greenhalge, Wolcott, and Crane, and is now (1903) on the staff of Governor Bates with rank of Brigadier- general.
