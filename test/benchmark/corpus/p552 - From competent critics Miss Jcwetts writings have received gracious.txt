From competent critics Miss Jcwett's writings have received gracious meed of praise. In- stance the following, which bears date 1897: "As the best material for stories may be wasted by unskilled hands, so the plain, the meagre, the connnonplace, may be used to mar- vellous advantage by the masters of the craft Miss Jewett's 'Country of the Pointed Firs' is a case in point. . . . The casual observer could see little of interest here (in a fishing village on the Maine coast), the average writer could make little of what he sees, but the acute and sympathetic; observer, the exceptional writer, comes on the scene, looks about, thinks, writes, and, behold! a fascinating story." Later work in 1900 called forth this appreciation: "With-

out falsifying cither inanimate or human nature, she transmutes their ruggechiess into pure gold, and arranges a harmony without one jarring note."

The scene of "The Tory Lover," Miss Jewett's latest work, is laid in the neighborhood of her own town of South Berwick. The famous Paul Jones is one of its personages, and other figures are drawn with tlue regard to historic facts and probabilities. The story is told with all the grace and skill which characterize her literary workmanship.

In 1901 Miss Jcwctt received from Bowdoin College the degree of Doctor of Literature, she being the first woman thus honored by that institution.

MRS. L. E. ORTH was born in Mil- ford, N.H., July 6, 1858. Her father, James Blood, was descended from Peter Blood, who was one of the first settlers of Dunstable, Mass. Her mother, Emeline AVheeler Blood, was the daugh- ter of Major James Wheeler, of Hollis, N.H., whose ancestors were English, and his wife, Dorcas Mooar, daughter of Jacob Mooar, wlio was of Scottish descent.

In 1775 Jacob Mooar, Mrs. Orth's great- grandfather, was sixteen years of age; and, when the bell of the Hollis meeting-house was rung to call the minute-men to arms, he was hoeing in his grandfather Nevin's field, three miles away. Hearing the bell, he dropped h's hoe upon the nearest boulder, and ran to an- swer the summons. The boulder upon which his hoe rested was a few years ago removetl to 'the centre of Hollis, and now stands on the green near the okl meeting-house fnjin whose belfry the summons rang. Jacob Mooar fought in the battle of Bennington.

Mrs. Emeline W. Blood was the leading so- prano in the village choir, and always took a prominent part in the local nmsical conven- tions. The daughter, Lizzie, inherited musical tendencies from her mother, and began the study of the piano at the age of ten. Later, when living in Springfield, Mass., she continued her studies under Professor F. Zuchtmann, at that time the foremost nmsician in Central

Massachusetts. Her musical talent showed such promise that, urged by her advisers, she planned t« go to Germany for study in June, 1877. On a visit to friends in Boston in Feb- ruary of that year she met the pianist, John Orth, who but two years before had returned with much eclat from five years' study in Ger- many with the foremost masters of that time — Kullak, Liszt, Deppe, Lebert, and Pruckner — in piano playing, and Kiel, Paisst, Weitzmann, and P. Scharwenka in theory.
