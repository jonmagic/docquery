REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

mittance, she was graduated in 1897, in a class of one hundred and twenty-six, with highest honors. One of the professors speaking of her at this time said, "She carries with her the confidence of the faculty, the highest esteem of her fellow-students, and possesses strong ele- ments of character that will win success in any calling."

In 1898 she was appointed assistant to the chair of oral surgery in the Northwestern Uni- versity Dental School, being the first woman to serve on its faculty She was also appointed clinical instructor in stomatology in the Woman's Medical College of Northwestern University in the same year, while also pursuing the practice of dentistry.

Through special work ilone in the interest of a broader medical edvication for dental practice Dr. Steeves became a member of the American Medical Association, and has made a good record in this society. She is also an active member in the Chicago Dental Society, Massachusetts Dental Society, and of her various alumni associations.

Although perhaps all that fortune could give in so short a time had fallen to our heroine's lot in the busy city of Chicago, she longed for the more sedate and settled atmosphere of New England. She therefore passed the Board of Dental Examiners of Massachusetts in March, 1902, and removed her office from Chicago to Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, on the first of May following. She was appointed consult- ing dentist to Trinity Dispensary, June, 1902, and attending dentist to the Academy of the Assumption, of Wellesley, Mass., in October, 1902. She is also dentist to the Homoeopathic Dispensary, Boston, and has recently been ap- pointed attending dentist to the Industrial School for Girls at Lancaster, Mass. She is much interested in securing proper oral condi- tions in children of the public schools.

Dr. Steeves is a strong advocate of co-etluca- tion, believing that women should have the same opportunities for mental training and for development of character and capacity from childhood up as men. And with her it is once a student, always a student: it never enters her mind to be satisfied witii present attainments, to forego an opportunity for original research.

ANNE PILSBURY.â€” Within a few years

/ \ there has coni(&gt; into existence what is X jLfc known as the new school of photog- ra])hy, for which P'. Holland Day, Mrs. Kasebier, Francis Watts Lee, and others have won wide recognition. Among the younger members of this school, Miss Pilsbury, during the four years she has been at work as a photogra])her, has made for herself a rather enviable place. Older photographers of the new school have s])oken warndy of her work, while what has perhaps pleased her most has been praise from men who are working in the conventional way, but who speak appreciatively of what she is iloing.

She has had, of course, to meet the criti- cism which has very natui'ally greeted all this new-school photography, or artistic photogra- phy, as it has been called. This term lias been used to cover nuich work, both good and bad, and has become a term of reproach to many people. To them it means simply a picture out of focus, and either very shadowy or with those strong contrasts of light and shade sup- posed by some to give a truly Remlirandt effect; for they often seize upon extravagances connnitted in the name of artistic photography as its worthy representatives. A photograph to be good in their eyes must be sharply fo- cussed, with all its details distinct. They hardly realize that there is room for another, method. At the recent caricature show in Boston was exhibited an almost invisible picture of a baby mounted in one corner of a large card, bearing the notice, "Special attention given to ]:)hotographs of children."
