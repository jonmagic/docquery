Educated in music, "brought up," as she once said, "on symphony concerts," a sym- pathetic student also in other realms of art, she has been both a musical and an art critic. Her tastes are nowhere more plainly seen than in the collection of choice paintings, and literary treasures — signed photographs, autograph books, letters, stamps, and souvenir cards — which her wide acquaintance with famous men and women in this country and abroad has brought to her.

An extensive traveller in this' country and in Europe, Miss Gould, like some other tourists, has made a practice of dipping her hands in the water of various places she has visited, her list including the Atlantic antl Pacific Oceans, and the chief rivers, lakes, bays, falls, of our own land and a number of the most fa- mous abroad. The hot geysers of the Na- tional Park and the icy waters of the Muir Glacier in Alaska mark the extremes of tem- perature she has encountered in pursuing this "hobby." The highest water she has reached

is that of the Yellowstone Lake, and the lowest, that of Holland.

In concluding this brief notice of Miss Gould and her work, it may be said she lives in the atmosphere of her own lines: —

Hardly more than a child though she was — her school-days just six weeks over — she had then printed one book, and had written another, "Juno Clifford," a novel, issued anonymously a few months after her marriage to William Upham Moulton, the publisher of a weekly paper to which she had been a contributor.

From the beginning she was a child of genius: it was only through the intuitive force of genius that she was able to know the hearts of men and women as she did at that very early period of her life — a genius that has ever since grown steadily as day grows out of dawn, and that reached its culmination in lyrics and in sonnets that have few superiors in our language.

[The daughter of Lucius L. and Louisa R. (Clark) Chandler, she was born in Pomfret, Conn. Her father was son of Charles and Hannah (Cleveland) Chandlei', and was de- scended from William' Chandler, an early set- tler of Roxbury, Mass., through his son John, who was about two years of age when the fam- ily came from England. John^ Chandler in 1686 removed from Roxbury, Mass., to Wood- stock, Conn. He was one of the twelve Rox- bury men who bought the territory known as Mashamoquet (now Pomfret), he being one of the six grantees in May, 16(S6.
