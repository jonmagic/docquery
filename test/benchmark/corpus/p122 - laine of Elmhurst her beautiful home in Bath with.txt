laine of Elmhurst, her beautiful home in Bath, with dignity and happy hospitality. To her mother's influence Ethel owed much of her charm of manner and brilliance of conversa- tion. The relation between Mrs. Hyde and her children is ideal.

Miss Ethel Hyde went through the usual routine of the schools in Bath, the instruction there received being supplemented by private tuition. At the age of eighteen, with her aunt, Mrs. Eames, mother of the famous vocalist, Emma Eames, she went to Europe to "finish her education," as the expression is, although, as a fact, her education never was complete. She was always learning, not satisfied with that which she had already acquired, but eager to gain knowledge in all directions. The result was the possession of a well-balanced, resource- ful mind, which appreciated the higher im- pulses of life while not disdaining its lighter claims. Bles,sed with a fine physique and graceful in form, she united in her person the classic requirements of the healthy mind in the healthy body. She was fond of outdoor life, and excelled in all athletic exercises. Her artistic sense was highly developed. This was characteristically displayed in her love of flowers, of which the beautiful beds at Elm- hurst were her especial care. Her fine percep- tion and good judgment as an amateur of art were attested by her fine collection of pictures from European galleries.

But, of all the gifts with which nature had endowed her, none was more marked than that of music. It was born in her, inherited to a large extent from her mother, who is a finished and artistic musician. Early promise of a musical voice was detected by the mother, who fostered and cared for it until the time came for higher cultivation. Miss Clara Munger, of Boston, was her first teacher. She subse- quently studied under Olivieri in Boston and Madam Picciotto, Van den Heuvel, and Manouri in Paris. The promise of early tlays was more than fulfilled. A voice of exquisite beauty and purity of tone had been trained in the highest and most artistic method, and a brilliant singer ai)])eared. Had her ambitions tended in that direction. Miss Hyde would have won laurels on the operatic stage; and, indeed, she was

often urged to devote herself to this career. Eminent critics who had heard her were unani- mously of the opinion that she would adorn the lyric profession. Anton Seidl declaied she had "a voice of velvet," while Jean de Reszke pronounced it the best amateur voice he had ever heard. But her own tastes did not lie in that way, and she voluntarily gave up an oppor- tunity that many might covet.

The gift, however, was not hidden; and Miss Hyde was ranked among the highest of amateur singers. Not only in her own home, but in social circles of New York, Boston, Newport, and Lenox, as well as in Paris, Venice, and other places abroad, she delighted all who heard her. In Washington she was a guest of the British and German Ambassadors, and on more than one occasion was specially invited to sing at the White House. In accordance with her habitual desire of making good use of her ac- complishments and acting up to the beneficent instincts of her nature, she devoted her talents largely to the cause of benevolence and charity. To this end she frequently organizetl concerts or gave recitals, in order to be able to minister to the wants of needy and deserving people, and there are many to-daj' who owe education and all that they are to her thoughtful consitl- eration.
