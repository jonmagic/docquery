In April, 1899, a loan exhibition was held by the chapter in the Royal House, Medford, which was attended by a large number of persons from far and near. The proceeds enabled the ladies in 1901 to open the Royal House to the public for a ixTmanent exhibition. They also published a descriptive jiamphlet relating to it. The house also is the head- (piarters of the chai)ter. The mansion, which is a fine example of colonial architecture, was remodelled by Isaac Royall in 1732, and it is known to have existe&lt;i in a plainer form as

early as 1690. During the siege of Boston it was the headquarters of the New Hampshire division of the Continental army.

FRANCI'^S LAUGHTON MACE, one of the best beloved poets of Maine, was born in Orono, on January 15, 1836. She died at Los Gatos, Cal., July 20, 1899. She was a daughter of Sumner Laugh- ton, M.D., and his wife, Mary A. Parker Laugh- ton. Dr. Lauglit(m was a ibhysician of excel- lent standing in his profession. He removed to Foxcroft when Frances was a year old, and removed thence with his family to liangor when she was about fourteen. She had already made excellent i)rogress in the schools of Foxcroft, reading all the iEneid of Virgil and his Bucolics at twelve and thirteen, and writing much under the tutelage and with the encouragement of both friends and teachers.

The principal of the Foxcroft Academy at the time she was a student there was Mr. Thomas Ta.sh, afterward of Portland, and of much ability as a teacher, well-known in Maine educational circles. He gave her work not only close and friendly criticism, but warm apjire- ciation. "It was he," she said long after- ward, "who gave me courage to persevere."

In Bangor she continued her studies at the high school, completing the course at sixteen, and with private teachers. She was always an eager and diligent student, and her thorough- ness and zeal are evidenced in her themes themselves and in her often lavish use of classic allusion and imagery. Her first verses were printed in the Waterville Mail when she was only twelve years old. It was not long be- fore her poems began to attract attention, and, some of them coming under the eye of the editor of the New York Journal of Conunerce, she was invited to contribute to that paper. The series of poems published in that journal includes some of the loveliest and most significant of her minor verse.

In 1855 she was married to Mr. Benjamin ?I. Mace, a lawyer of Bangor, where they resided till the hope of firmer health for both induced their removal to San Jose, Cal.

life in Bangor after her marriage were very fruitful years. Notwithstanding the cares of her home and of the eight little ones who came to gladden it (four of them living, to go with her to the Californian home), she was still an in- defatigable student. Her vocation as poet was to her, as Mrs. Browning had said of her own calling long before, "a serious thing." Every- thing that could contribute to the enrichment and tlignity of her poetry was made to yield ^ts revenues: classic story and local legend alike were woven into it. She was constantly seek- ing its betterment and continually increasing the stores of knowledge and association which should enhance its charm.
