The Merritt household was a cheerful, happy one, unclouded by stern discipline, the youth- ful gayety of the children heartil)' encouraged by their parents. Salome was a wide-awake, lively girl, very fond of pets, making play- fellows of the domestic animals. At school she was bright and quick to master difficult tasks. Having completed the courses provided in the district school and high school, she taught for a few terms. After that she continued her education at the seminary in East Greenwich, R.L, graduating in 1864, the valedictorian of her class.

For the next seven years she was a success- ful teacher; but longing for a broader field of activity, a vocation which should be of greater benefit to others, she decided to adopt the profession of metlicine, an undertaking attended in those days with many difficulties, not the least of which was public disfavor. Conse- quently her sister, who throughout life was her devoted companion, sharing all her hard- ships and successes, tried to dissuade her, but

without avail. Her resolution taken, she en- tered the Boston Female Medical College. This college soon passing into control of Boston Uni- versity anil changing from the old to the homcoo- pathic school, she entered the New York Free Medical College for Women, from which she was graduated in 1874, having completed in one year the work usually assigned for a three years' course. Upon the resignation of the noted Dr. J. V. C. Smith, profe.ssor of anatomy, Dr. Merritt was upon his recommendation ap- pointed to fill the vacancy. For two years she remained in this responsible position, proving fully the wisdom of the choice; but, longing for the busy, useful life of an active practice, she came to Boston, and established herself at 59 Hancock Street, where she remained until 1896.

Meantime numerous other claims demanded a part of her time. She was a born sufTragist, and worked perseveringly to advance the cause in all directions, national, State, and mu- nicipal. She originated and secured several amendments to the statutes of assessment and registration by which school suffrage was made easier. She was a charter member of the National Woman Suffrage Association, was its president in 1893, and from the start always gave her earnest support and unfailing interest to all its measures.

As a voter in Ward Ten, Boston, she was active in all matters concerning the welfare of the public schools, and diil much to arouse the interest of other women. As a member of the original W^ard and City Committee of Women Voters, her influence and exertions were di- rected toward securing the election of the best women and men to the school board, thus mak- ing it a greater ])ower for good. This was a matter of vital importance to her, and she de- voted to it much of her time and strength. \Mien, in 1888, the anti-Catholic question in the management of the public schools arose, Dr. Merritt took a firm stand against the meas- ure as unconstitutional and un-American. A year later, when the Citizens' Public School LTnion w;is formed, she was made its president. This organization was a potent factor in pre- venting the board from being made an entirely Protestant body.
