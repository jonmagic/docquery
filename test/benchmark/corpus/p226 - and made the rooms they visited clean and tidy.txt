and made the rooms they visited clean and tidy. They went to the city magistrate, and pleaded for better sanitary conditions. When the i)lague under their vigorous measures began to abate, they did not cease their work. They established a permanent home in the dark section, the worst in London. It was really the first "settlement" in any slum, though not so called. They began industrial work and established educational classes, Eng- land at this time (1867) having no system of free public schools. Their night school was soon crowded with men of all ages and conditions. They gathered the street boys into bright, warm rooms, and organized them into clubs.

One lady belonging to the cultured class went into the "thieves' quarters," working and teaching there for years. Through her loving faithfulness hundreds were rescued from lives of shame, aiul became upright citizens. One whom Miss Cooke knew became a lay preacher, whose effective work rescued many. Men's clubs were opened, mothers' meetings held, coffee rooms establisheil; and lodging- houses, clean and well kept, took the place of the "dens" that had been "dens of thieves." The gospel service was held in the waiting- room. 'Trained nurses visited in the homes, ministering to their inmates; and Christian doctors gave their services. A marvellous change was wrought in a few years. The number of workers was constantly increased, and twenty-four stations were established in the worst parts of London, managed by the Mildmay workers. When Miss Cooke went there in 1890, these women were ministering to one hundred thousand of London's poor. They had several well-equipped hospitals, four medical missions, convalescent, women's, and orphans' asylums.

In such a practical school of methods Miss Cooke took her three years' course, in 1892 having charge of the night study classes. Work- ing in every department, she learned lessons that are now bearing fruit. In the spring of 1893 she accepted an invitation to enter the Hull Street settlement, Boston, which had iieen started the preceding January by students of Boston University, among them the Rev. Rollin H. Walker and the Rev. Edgar Helms

and his sainti'd wife, who brought to this work a consecration which has left an impress for permanent good. Another member of the settlement was Miranda Croucher, who showed such heroic courage during the Boxer massacres in China.

Miss Cooke took an interest in the entire work of the settlement, which is of an all-round character; but the part that owes its origin to her is the medical mission, which was her special charge under difficulties that would have discouraged a less experienced worker. This work — the founding of the medical mission in connection with the university settlement at 36 Hull Street — is the crowning work of Miss Cooke's long and busy life. It is the first medical mission established in New Eng- land, and the settlement is the only one, so far as we know, which has this ilepartment connectetl with it. It may here be best de- seribeil in Miss Cooke's own words : " Its aim is far different from a free dispensary. It cannot be denied that New England Ls rapidly becoming foreign missionary ground. It is therefore fitting that the best agencies should be usetl to bring this foreign population into sympathy antl in touch with American civiliza- tion and American ideas of education.
