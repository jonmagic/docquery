topics, many of her lectures being profusely illustrated with stereopticon slides.

Federation of Women's Clubs, and in other places of respon- sibility in connection with club work.

OlAYE E. DANA has won an enviable reputation as story-teller, essayist, antl poet. Her first published article ap- peared in 1S77. "Untler Friendly Eaves" is a volume of short stories, revealing the natural and wholesome atmosphere and at the same time the romantic and heroic spirit which pervade the true New England life. This book, as one reviewer has fitly said, "brings the reader into ]ileasant places and among honest 'kintra' folk of the sterling kind such as may be found in the rural dis- tricts with which Mrs. Stowe first began to make us familiar." Through Miss Dana's character sketches the reader is introduced to genuine country and village people; and, if the crabbed, miserly old man and the melan- choly and morbid woman occasionally appear, they are portrayed as exceptions, not as types. The iiifluenc(&gt; of her stories, imbu(Â»d as they are with the spirit of cheery helpfulness, is

eimobling and ui)lifting. Many of her stories are for children and young people. In ad- dition to her rare gifts as a story-teller. Miss Dana jiossesses the poet's instinct and power of interjM'etation. Her publi.shed verses, among them being such poems as "The Summons," " I'vXplanation," "For Light," "Shakespeare's Day," and "It Always Comes," which di.sclose a deep spiritual insight into nature and humanity, have been widely copied. Miss Dana has also contributed to the Journal of Education, and other similar publications, ar- ticles which, with her critical and literary es- says and her able and discriminating V)ook reviews, disclose a scholarly and cultured mind, originality of thought, and the keen instinct of the critic.

In her literary work, as well as in her per- sonal character, Miss Dana shows her rich New England heritage. There have been nu- merous instances in the history of our coun- try which prove that literary al)ility is the ])roduct. not alone of individual talent, but also of family inheritance; and, in view of this un(|uestione(l fact. Miss Dana comes right- fully by her mental strength and versatility of talent. She is a direct descendant of Rich- ard Dana, whose name appears upon the rec- ords of Cambridge, Mass., in 1640, and who was the founder of a family which has con- tributed in a marked degree to the social, literary, and political advancement of our country. Patriots, soldiers, preachers, edi- tors, authors, scientists, college [iresidents and professors, are all found in the annals of the family bearing the old and honored name of Dana.
