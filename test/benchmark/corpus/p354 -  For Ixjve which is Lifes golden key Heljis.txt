" For Ixjve, which is Life's golden key, Heljis to unlock all mystery ; While Truth will ever point the way, If Love we have as guest alway.

" Faith, Hope, and Love will guide us on, Until the victory we have won. Discouraged thoughts we'll bid away, That happier ones may come to stay.

" So let us all in love unite Through harmony, with music bright. We'll lift the souls now sick and sad. And manv wearv hearts make glad."

The motto of the .society is, " Love conquers the world," ami the organizers of the Faith and Hope Association are putting heart and soul into the work of such branches as have alreaily been established. They do not "beg" for their charities, but state the case, and feel confident that the case will recommend itself.

Sin antl want are the foes they propose to fight and comiuer â€” sin of any kind, and want in whatever 'nature it manifests itself. It is often want of proper knowledge that plunges the soul over its first moral precipice. Igno- rance of the laws of nature is sin to the third and fourth generation.

At the Easter sea- son, also, the message of the resurrection, borne by beautiful flowers, is carried into hospitals and homes.

The association, knowing that the affairs of city and State will -some day be in the hands of the lioys now being brought up, and some of them under wrong influences, are going out into the highways and hetlges to find the neg- lected and those under vicious and unhealthy moral conditions, and are trying by means of pleasant allurements of boyish sports and healthy games to secure their attention and win them to ways of virtue.

A floiwisliing sewing society is maintained in connection with the association, and hundreds of warm garments are made each year antl dis- tributed. Homes have been found in institu- tions foi' those having moral or ])hysical neetls, and judicious loans have been matle to meet pressing demands. All this work, however, has been made subservient to spiritual needs, and the chief aim has been to show that a right use of spiritual gifts will !)reclude much of the physical suffering of the world. All the ofh- cers of the association, it may here be said, are working for the love of doing good, there being no salaries.
