In sunny jilaces, and the wild clove-pink; And I would gather sprays of woodbine climbing

And bearded grasses from the fields and fells, List'uing the while, if I might catch the chiming ' Of wild bluebells.

"From sunlit heights, from billowy .seas of meadow. From ferny hollows and from giassy braes. The blossoms of the sunshine and the shadow.

With all the grace of nature's wild sweet ways, I'd glean and paint on tablet, j)anel, portal, To render them immortal.

"And they who never see the summer's glory. The treasures of the woodland and the stream, Should learn from me to read the wondrous story.

Sweeter by far than poet's sweetest dream (And, reading, cease to count the weary hours) â€” God's gift of flowers!"

"Rock of Ages" and "Dandelions" have been most widely quoted, and appeal most strongly to the popular ear, yet they are by no means her best.

The poems are chiefly of the lyrical order, interspersed with ballads, metrical transla- tions of odes of Horace, and some exquisite sonnets. Occasionally she tries her hand at .some historical incident, throwing it, as a study, into poetic measures. An illustration of this is "The Death of Charles the Ninth." This was written for her brother, tJien a stu- dent at Bowdoin College, to be used as a reci- tation in a competition for a prize.

If dramatic poetry be that in which the ob- jects contemplated, animate or inanimate, are presented as speaking for them.selves, then several of her ]X)ems are of this class, .such as "Immortality," "Useless," "The' Pop- lar," and others. In fact, her compass is wide, for she has produced some humorous poetry as well, of a high order, that has never foimd its way into print.

But to those who know her best her pub- lished works fail to adequately represent her. They seem but a fragment of what, had her health been uniform, she would probably have produced. For years she suffered from a

complication of nervous maladies, and doubt- less "learned in suffering what she taught in song."

Her endowments are found in alliance with a masculine understanding and finely adjusted ethical and religious &lt;iualities. She is a mem- ber of the l^aptist church, and lives an active Christian life; and one of her best rewards for publishing a volume of poetry has been the letters she has received acknowledging the help and comftn-t ilerived from some of the poems which seemed to voice the sentiment of the sufferer. Mrs. Moore is exceedingly interested in all (luestions of theology and religion, ac(iuainted with the discussion of "the higher criticism," well read in science and philosophy, in which she thinks profoundly and reasons acutely. Should future health and leisure be granted her, with a disposition to write again ior publication, I should rather expect from her pen something in the line of religious life and experience, or an examina- tion of some subject m philosophy, or some application of a new scientific fact to life and conduct, than more in the line of poetry and fiction. I add a sonnet from "Songs of Sun- shine and Shadow," addressed to C. E. S., almost perfect in form and rich in suggestion :
