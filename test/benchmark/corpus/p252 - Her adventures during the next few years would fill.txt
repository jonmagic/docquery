Her adventures during the next few years would fill a volume. No suffrage association was organized until long after this time. She had no co-operation and no backing, and started out absolutely alone. So far as she knew, there were only a few persons in the whole countrj^ who had any sympathy with the idea of e(|ual rights for women.

She travelled over a large {lart of the Ihiited States. In most of the towns where she lect- ured, no woman had ever spoken in public before, and curiosity attracted immense audi- ences. The speaker was a great surprise to them. The general idea of a woman's rights advocate, on the part of those who had never seen one, was of a tall, gaunt, angular woman, with aggressive manners, a masculine air, and a strident voice, scolding at the men. In- stead, they found a tiny woman, with quiet, unassuming maimers, a winning presence, and the sweetest voice ever possessed by a public speaker. This voice l^ecame celebrated. It was so musical and delicious that persons who had once heard her lecture, hearing her utter

a few words years afterward, on a railroad car or in a stage-coach, where it was too dark to recognize faces, would at once exclaim un- hesitatingly, "That is Lucy Stone!"

Old people who remember those early lect- ures say that she had a wonderful eloquence. There were no tricks of oratory, but the trans- parent sincerity, simplicity, and intense earn- estness of the speaker, adcled to a singular per- sonal magnetism and an utter forgetfulness of self, swayed those great audiences as the wind bends a field of grab's. (3ften mobs would listen to her when they howled down every other speaker. At one woman's rights meeting in New York the mob made such a clamor that it was impossible for any sj^eaker to be heard. One after another tried it, only to have his or 'her voice drowned forthwith by hoots and howls. \\'illiam Henry Channing advised Lu- cretia Mott, who was presiding, to atljourn the meeting. Mrs. Mott answ ered, " W hen the hour fixed for adjournment comes, I will ad- journ the meeting, not before." At last Lucy was introduced. The mob became as quiet as a congregation of church-goers: but, as soon as the next speaker began, the howling recom- menced, and it continued to the end. At the close of the meeting, when the speakers went into the dressing-room to get their hats and cloaks, the mob surged in and surroundefl them ; and Lucy, who was brimming over with indignation, began to reproach them for their behavior. "Oh, come," they answered, " vou needn't say anything : we kept still for you!"

At an anti-slavery meeting held on Cape Cod, in a grove, in the open air, a platform had been erected for the speakers, and a crowd assembletl, but a crowd so menacing in aspect and with so evitlent an intention of- violence that the speakers one by one came down from the stand and slipped quietly away, till none were left but Stephen Foster and I^ucy Stone. She said, "You had better run, Stephen: they are coming." He answered, " But who will take care of you?" At that moment the mob made a rush for the platform, and a big man sprang up on it, grasping a club. She turned to him and said without hesitation, " This gen- tleman will take care of me." He declareil
