The beyond had no terrors for her. She said to her tlaughter, with her accent of simple antl complete conviction: "I have not the smallest ajiprehension. I know the Eternal Order, and I believe in it." Something being s;dd by a friend, v.ho was a Spiritualist, aliout her possibly coming back to connnunicate with those she had left, she answered, "I expect to be too busy to come back." To another friend she said, "I look forward to the other side as the brighter side, and I expect to be busy for good things."
