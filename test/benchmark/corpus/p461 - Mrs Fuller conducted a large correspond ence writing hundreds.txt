Mrs. Fuller conducted a large correspond- ence, writing hundreds of letters and arousing an interest in the order outside of Massachu- setts. Sh(^ believed in a national organization, and penned the first letter in its behalf. She secured the interest of jirominent comrades in New Hampshire, and it was announceil in general orders of Department Connnander George Bowers, of that State, that a conven- tion would be held at Laconia, October 21, 1880. Mrs. Fuller and Mrs. E. Florence Barker were invited to organize a State Department. The success of the work having been assureil in Massachu.setts and New Hampshire, a cor- respondence was conducted with the G. A. R. officials in Connecticut. As the result, in No- vember, 1882, Mrs. Fuller, in company with Mrs. Barker (her successor as Department President), organized several corps in that State. The Union Board, comprising the De- partments of Mas.sachu,setts, New Hampshire, and Coimecticut, was formeil with heailquar- ters in Boston.

necessity for a national order, was one of the three delegates chosen to represent the Depart- ment of Massachusetts at the convention in Denver, Col., in 1883. This convention, callcil by Commander-in-chief Paul Van Der Voort, resulted in the National Woman's Relief Cor]is, the early history of which is given in the sketch of Mrs. E. Florence Barker. Mrs. Fuller was a prominent participant in the convention, and was unanimously chosen National Sec- retary. A busy year ensued. Over two thousand communications were written and many hundred pages of instruction prepared by her, numerous otlier duties also receiving attention. From September 5, 1SS3, to Feb- ruary 23, 1884, she issued sup])lies for eiglity- nine cor))s.

At the second National ('onvention, held at Minneapolis, July, 1884, she was elected Senior Vice-President. Dining that year she insti- tuted three corps in Rhode Island and visited Vermont on a tour of inspection, organizing a department in that State. At the third Na- tional Convention, held in Portland, Me., in June, 1885, she was elected National President, and, upon returning home tendered her resig- nation as Dei)artment secretary of Massachu- setts. Meanwhile she had organized Corps No. 3 in East Boston, auxiliary to John A. Hawes Post, No. 159, and for nearly two years served as its president. In view of her retirement from the presidency of Corps No. 3, in order to enter upon her duties as the official heatl of the National Woman's Relief Corps, the post on July 24, 1885, adopted a series of resolutions ex])ressing their warm ajjpreciation of her loyalty and devotion to the principles of the order and of the valuable services she had rendered them, and assiu'ing her that the sin- cere and heartfelt good wishes of the post would follow her day by day, as she continued to labor for the good of the order in the high position to which she had been called.
