Mrs. Beeman obtained her education in the public schools of Cambridge and Hyde Park, Mass. While still in school she studied dress- making, which she began to teach at the age of sixteen. Possessing strong artistic instincts, she was not contented to remain at this occu- pation, but in 1893-94 taught a public school in Western Massachusetts, having previously become a student at the New England Con- servatory of Music. Later, at the age of twenty- one, she entered the Emerson School of Oratory. Graduating with honors from that institution after the usual course, she accepted a position there as teacher of music, physical culture, and elocution, which .she held for several years. She has since introduced physical culture and oratory into the public schools in the vicinity of Boston, devoting a great part of her time to the instruction of teachers in this work, with the approbation of the school authorities. Her labors in this direction have also included
