About the time that Abby Kelley became known to the public, another lecturer appeared on the anti-slavery platform, one who exciteil more animosity, if less ridicule, than she. This was Stephen S. Foster, who out-Garrisoned even the famous leader. In his ability to por- tray in vivid anil terrible language the sin of the sla\T-holder and the wickedness of the church and clergy in lending countenance to the system, he was without a rival. No meeting was dull where he spoke. Indeed, a mob was the not imjirobable outcome, before which Mr. Foster never quailed. A non- resistant, he carried always with him two invaluable weapons â€” a piercing eye, with which he transfixetl liis assailants, and a wonderful magnetic power, which enabled him to hokl an audience, though they writhed under his ter- rible denunciations. But he was sometimes roughly handled, and several times received serious injuries.

This brave martyr spirit was the mate for whom destiny had preserved Abby Kelley from her many youthful adn\irers. Marriage had never attracted her; for marriage, at that time, meant the absolute submission of the wife, her entire loss of identity. To such a union such a woman could never consent. But when this wooer came there was a difference. The great principle of human freedom which he applied to the black slave he applied also to the white woman, who was a subject, if not a chattel. He had the same great cause at heart as Miss Kelley. Like her, he had labored with- out money and without price, had given up his profession ami his creed for the slave. Mar-

riage to such a man seoined to her the realiza- zation of an ideal, and so it proved. But there was one condition: three entire years must be devoted to the sacred cause. So the travellinj;; and lecturing went on. T^p and down, from Maine to Ohio, always with some woman for a travelling companion. Miss Kelloy toiled almost without rest. One sununer she spoke every day for six weeks and sometimes twice a day. The meetings (some of them large conventions) were often held in groves, and it was this severe strain which broke the voice, before so strong and clear.

In December, 1845, Abby Kelley and Stephen S. Foster were married. For a year or two previously they had consented to receive the small salary then usually paid to lecturei's. They felt that they owed something to the new relation and duties they were soon to assume. Mr. P''oster had also realized some- thing from an anti-slavery work which he wrote about that time. With this small sum the husband and wife purchased a farm in the suburbs of Worcester, Mass., which continued to be their home till Mr. Foster's death in 1881. But their public work was not given up. Mr. Foster was usually absent during the winter on lecturing tours, while Mrs. Foster made several long campaigns in the West, besides often attending conventions or giving lectures nearer home. When asked how she could bear to leave her little daughter, she would reply, " I leave my child in wise and loving hands and but for a little, while the slave mothers daily have their daughters torn from their arms and sold into torture and infamy."
