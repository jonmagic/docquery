tember, 1762, and settled as pastor of the church in Scarboro, Me., where he died in 1775. Coffin mentions him as a graduate of Harvard in 1759, evidently an error, as his name is not in the college catalogue. He probably studied at Harvard for a time before going to Cilouces- ter, Mass., where he taught school previous to entering the ministry, and where he found his wife, Anna Haskell, whom he married in November, 1762. She was the daughter of Captain William^ Ha.skell, of Gloucester, the fourth of the name in direct line. William' Haskell, the immigrant progenitor, settled in Gloucester. He was made Lieutenant of the train-band in 1661, and afterward was Cap- tain. In 1672 and in several later years he served as Representative to General Court.

Thomas" Pierce, born in October, 1763, son of the Rev. Thomas and his wife Anna, mar- ried about 1783 Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph and Joanna (Graves) Storer, of Westbrook, then Falmouth, Me. Of this union were born eleven children, Joanna, who became the wife of Samviel Sanborn, as recorded above, being the youngest.

Major Charles^ Frost, father of Lydia, the wife of Benjamin Pierce, was born in England, and came to this country with his father, Nich- olas Frost, in 1634. He was killed by Indians in 1697, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He served as Deputy from Kittery to Massachu- setts General Court in 1658 and in five later years. He was commissioned Captain in July, 1668; was made Commander-in-chief of the military forces of Maine, with the title of Ser- geant Major, in August, 1689; and served as a Councillor or Assistant, 1693-97.

Sarah Wainwright, wife of Lieutenant Charles' Frost and mother of Abigail, wife of Thomas* Pierce, was daughter of Captain Simon Wainwright, of Haverhill. Her father com- manded a garrison during the Indian troubles, and was slain in an attack on the town, August 29, 1708. His wife was Sarah Gilbert.

Joseph Storer, of Falmouth, father of Eliza- beth, Miss Sanborn's maternal grandmother, was a soldier of the Revolution. He enlisted for three years in the latter part of 1776, but tiled at Fishkill, in the State of New York, in 1777. In the Revolutionary Rolls of Massa-

chusetts, in the State archives, "Joseph Storer: Appears in a list of men raised to serve in the Continental Army from Col. Peter Noyes's (1st Cumberland Co.) regt. Town belonged to, Falmouth. Town enlisted for, Falmouth. Term of enlistment, 3 years. Joined Capt. BlaisdeirÂ§ co.. Col. Wigglesworth's regt." (vol. xHii. 43 c).
