At about the age of nineteen Lucy joined the Orthodox Congregational church in W^est Brookfield. Soon after, Deacon Henshaw was brought to trial before the church for having entertained anti-slavery speakers at his house and otherwise aided and abetted the abolition movement. When the first vote was taken, Lucy, who did not know that women could not vote in church meetings, held up her hand with the rest. The minister, a tall, dark man, pointed fner to her, and said to the man who was counting the votes. "Don't you count her." The man said, "Why, isn't she a member?" "Yes," answered the minister, "she is a mem- ber, but not a voting member." His accent of scorn stirred her indignation. "Six votes were taken at that meeting, and I held up my hand every time," she said to her daughter, raising her hand above her head, with a flash in her eye, as she recalled the incident, while lying on her death-bed. Deacon Henshaw, Lucy, and a number of other members were later drojiped from the rolls of the church for their activity in the anti-slavery cause.

On June 27, 1837, the General Association of the Orthodox Congregational Churches of Massachusetts met at Brookfield. There had been a great outcry against the anti-slavery speaking of Abby Kelley and the Grimke sisters; and a pastoral letter from the Asso- ciation to the churches under its charge had been prepared, to be read at this meeting. The object of the letter was to close the churches against anti-slavery lectures, and especially

to silence the women. It calleil attentujn to dangers now seeming " to threaten the female character with wide-spread and permanent injury." It claimed that the New Testament clearly defined "the appropriate duties and influence of women. Tlie power of woman is in her dependence. When she assumes the place and tone of a man as a public reformer, our care and protection of her seem unneces- sary: we put ourselves in self-defence against her. She yields the power which Cod has given her for protection, and her character becomes unnatural." The letter especially cf)ndenined those "who encourage females to bear an ob- trusive and ostentatious })art in measures of reform, and countenance any of that sex who so far forget themselves as to itinerate in the character of public lecturers and teachers." This was the letter which Whittier called the " Brook- fiekl Bull," and of which he wrote: —

" So this is all — the utmost reach

Of priestly power the mind to fetter! VVlieii laymen tliink, when women preach, — A war of words — a ' Pastoral Letter '! "

Lucy went to the meeting. The body of the church was black with ministers, and the gal- lery was tilled with women and laymen. While the famous letter was being read, the Rev. Dr. Blagden marched up and down the aisle, turning his head from side to side and looking at the women in the gallery, as nuich as to say, "Now we have silenced you." Lucy lis- tened in great indignation, and at each aggra- vating sentence she nudged her cousin, who said afterward that her side was black antl blue. At the close of the meeting she told her cousin that, if she ever had anything to say in public, she would say it, and all the more because of that pastoral letter.
