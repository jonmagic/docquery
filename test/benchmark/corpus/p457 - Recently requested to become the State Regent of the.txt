Recently requested to become the State Regent of the Massachusetts D. A. R., Mrs. Pendergast on account of home cares felt obliged to decline the honor, as she did two years ago, when urged to take the position of State Di- rector for Massachusetts Children of the Ameri- can Revolution.

Mrs. Pendergast is a woman of literary talent and the author of several poems. The ode sung at the reunion of the Charlestown High School Alunmi Association in 1S84 was written by her for that occasion.

Her spacious home contains many relics, books, and souvenirs of value, among them being the sword l)rought home by Samuel Thompson from the French and Indian wars and the drumsticks used l)y Jonathan Thomp- .son in the Revolution. Upon the wall hang the Pendergast coat of aims and the Worth coat of arms, both framed and artistically ex- ecuted.

An aunt. Miss Nancy Pendergast, who is a member of her family, was an army nurse dur- ing the Civil War, and served in the hospitals at Point Lookout and Anna])olis.

BARBARA GALPIN.â€” For twenty-five years Mrs. Galpin has been identified with the SomerriUe Journal, which is said to be one of the best and most widely known weekly local papers in the United States, l)eing in a class by itself in tlie matter of literary excellence, home attractions, and editorial enterprise.

Mrs. Galpin was born in Weathersfield, Vt., daughter of Henry Clay Johnson. Her moth- er's maiden name was Helen Frances Jones. From four years of age she lived in Claremont, N.H., where she attended the Stevens High School. At sixteen she married Henry Wallace Galpin, a well-to-do citizen, many years her senior. One son, George, was born to them. While she was still in her teens, her husband

(Wed, and complications in business matters wrecked the estate, and left her dependent upon her own energies.

Coming to Somerville a quarter of a century ago, this woman, now honored in social, fra- ternal, and professional life, took her place at the compositor's case, where she soon became an expert. Incidentally she held copy, and at her own motion l)egan to edit manuscript, through which cchting she first attracted attention. She soon became a proof-reader, and gave the paper its distinction for ty- pographical as well as literary excellence. From this it was a short cut to editorial management, which she combined with pro- motion of circulation, where her business ability first showed itself. When, sixteen years ago, the proprietor became the treasurer of Middlesex County, Mrs. Galpin assumed the management of the business details, while re- taining oversight of the circulation schemes and all literary and special features of the pa])er.

The Woman's Page, which she conducts, and which has been one of the leaiiing feat- ures of the paper, has been on as high a level as the work in any of the popular literary weeklies, and would of itself give her tlistinc- tion in journalism. Her many series of articles on travel, both in America and in Eu- rope, are among the most readable and in- structive of their kind in magazine literature. One of the most complete of her series has been issued in book form, under the caption "In Foreign Lantls." Her historical articles have attracted even more attention, and one of these has been published by the Somer- ville Historical Society as its first official issue. As a writer of verse and songs, Mrs. Galpin has won high praise. She has been ecjually fortunate in public speaking. Her promi- nence in various lines of activity leil to invi- tations to make addresses before women's clubs, historical .societies, and various other associations. Her platform work is as care- fully prepared as is the work from her ]:)en,and her reputation as a speaker is well-nigh equal to that in literary effort. Her most important addresses in point of honor were before the Suburban Press Association of New England
