still the banner department. I trust that we may be able to claim this in every department in which our line of work takes us. There is peace within our borders, and sitlc by side with our comrades we stand for every good we can accomplish under the banner upon which is in- scribed the principles of the Grand Army of the Republic — Fraternity, Charity, and Loyalty."

In referring to the Soldiers' Home she .said : " If there is one spot more than another that the loving care and devotion of the true-hearted women of our department centres around, it is this home, where to-day rest in peace the war-worn antl crippled veterans who have fought the battles of their country and are entitled to all that we can do to make their last days those of peace and comfort."

She recommendetl that all corps be requested to appoint a Soldiers' Home Committee, whether they have a room in the home or not, this committee to arrange that at least once a year a donation of either money or articles be sent to the home.

Among other subjects of interest that were ably considered by Mrs. Cook was the flag sa- lute. Concerning this she expressed the fol- lowing sentiments: "Our country's flag — how our hearts thrill with pride, as we watch its graceful folds as they float in the breeze of heaven, antl think that on every sea, in every port where conmierce finds its way, wherever civilization has its home and human free- dom has an inspiration, that ensign is wel- comed and beloved! It speaks to us by all the memories of the past to do all in our power to maintain this heritage. Realizing that in this symbol we do see the world's best hope for civil and religious liberty, our organiza- tion has taken upon itself the task, believing it to be a duty as well as a privilege, to use every legitimate means to have the salute to the flag introduced into the public schools. Should not our children be taught that the flag is the guardian of all their most treasured inter- ests? By this we hope, too, that a new spirit of patriotism maybe awakened in the community."

Her administration was a successful one, Mrs. Cook being guided by a sincere desire faithfully to serve the Department of Massa- chusetts, over which she liad the honor to rule.

Benjamin I'\ Cook enlisted in April, 1861, as private in Company K, Twelfth Massachu- setts Regiment. He was commissioned First Lieutenant, January 26, 1862; Captain, May 2, 1862; Major, July 23, 1863; and Lieutenant Colonel, May 6, 1864. The regiment, com- manded by Colonel Fletcher Webster, left Boston July 24, and three days later was sta- tioned on the Maryland side of the Potomac River, about a mile from Harper's Ferry. It participated in many of the leading battles of the war. On the skirmish line at Peters- burg the Twelfth received orders " to drive the foe from their entrenchments on the rail- road." Colonel Bates reported: "This was performed under Lieutenant Colonel Cook in gallant style, advancing so far that the re- mainder of the brigade thought they had been taken prisoners." In July, 1864, the regi- ment reached Boston with one hundred and seventy men. Colonel Cook commanded the regiment in several campaigns, principally with the Army of the Potomac, antl was under fire more than sixty times. He has served as president of the regimental association, and he is the author of the interesting " History of the Twelfth Regiment," which was pub- lished in 1882. His wife aided him in collect- ing data for this volume, and served as his amanuensis.
