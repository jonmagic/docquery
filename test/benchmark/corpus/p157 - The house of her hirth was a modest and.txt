The house of her h)irth was a modest and ancient-looking domicile on the northerly side of Salem Street, which was many years ago removed to give place to the residence erected by her brother, Lucius B. Evans, and nf)W owned and occupied by his son, Harvey B. Evans.

Mrs. Flint on her father's side was descended from Nathaniel Evans, who with his father, Henry Evans, came from Wales about two and a half centuries ago, and .settleil in that part of Maiden afterward annexed to the town of Reading and now known as the village of Greenwood. On her mother's side Mrs. Flint was connected with some of the leading fami- lies of Woburn. The early life of Mrs. Flint was surrounded with good influences, and she was taught to cherish high ideals and to do good to others. Receivetl into the Baptist church at the age of sixteen, she remained steadfast in her faith during her long and ac- tive life. Her education was obtained in th(! public schools of her native town. Her eager mind and studious habits enabled her to accu- mulate a valuable store of information, which, united with her native connnon .sense and good judgment, carried her successfully through the varied experiences and responsibilities she was in later years called upon tf) meet.

In 1840 the subject of this sketch left her home to become the wife of Charles Frederick Flint, of North Reading, whose accjuaintance she had made while teaching school in that village. Mr. Flint was a worthy representa- tive of an old and honoraljle famih , being a (k'- scendant in the sixth generation of Thomas Flint, an early settler at Salem Village, and a nephew of the Rev.

A man of nmch force of character, with practical sa- gacity heightened by judicious reading and dili- gent improvement of the means within his reach, he gained influence and respect among his fellow-citizens. Ho added lands and money to his patrimony, and, when the Salem and Lowell Ra'.lroad was laid out through North Reading, his public spirit and private interest induced him to become a large subscriber to its capital stock. When the fate of the enter- prise trembled in the Imlance, he put his shoul- der to the wheel, and by his energy and means was largely instrumental in its successful launching and development. He became a director and the president of the corporation, while the enhancement in value of its stock added much to his fortune. Dying in the ma- turity of his powers, at the age of sixty years, from the results of an accidental fall, he be- queathed the bulk of his wealth to his wife, they having had no children. She was made executrix of the will.

Mrs. Flint in her bereavement and sorrow found herself thus unexpectedly confronted with important and pressing responsibilities, which she met with courage and resolution, as duties to be performed. Her well-trained fac- ulties and resources of mind and character en- abled her to assume and successfully fulfil all the requirements of her position. Her keen insight, her tact and energy, her thoughtful judgment, and great business capacity were wonderfully manifest in all the affairs that from this time entered into her life-work. These ciualities enabled her not only to hold undiminished the extensive estate left to her charge, but to more than double the original value of the property.
