any textile, the finer the stuff and the larger the hole, the more absorbing was the occupa- tion. A gift of insight into the construction of things was also coupletl with technical skill, and thus, when she mended a fabric, she came to understand readily how it had been woven. One day, while she was mending for an ac- quaintance a point lace collar which had met with an accident, there came to her this thought : "If any woman can make that lace, I must be able to do so also." Fine laces had always been dear to her heart, and she possessed a few simple pieces of ^'alenciennes, English thread, and Honiton.

Like all well-onleretl Boston girls, she went first for information to the Public Library. There were many volumes on the history of lace, and a few about how to make it, most of the latter being in German, French, Italian, or Russian. Here the Latin School training, in going to the root of matters, came in, as well as the instruction in French. German had been learned outside of the school, so she read all the German and the French books. Then, as some Italian books contained interesting illustrations, she set herself to work to study Italian, so that she could translate these also. In the meantime she began to produce bits of \&gt;netian ])oint lace, but the lack of proper thread was a gi'eat obstacle. Securing some little balls of the finest to be hail here, she cut out a few inches at a time where it ran fine, and re- jected the rest; but even this was not suitable for fine mesh, which is the joiid of Brussels point.

At this stage of her progress, pillow lace making began to invite her attention. No materials were at hand. Torchon lace was not what she .sought' it was the "piece lace," such as Honiton and Duchesse, and here she came to a halt. Not a book in the library offered any technical information. At the Arts and Crafts Exhibition in Copley Hall in 1899 was a case containing laces made by an Italian woman, whose address was gi\-en in the cata- logue. While the lace was of the torchon \'ariety, Mrs. Weber felt that at least she could ac(|uire the use of the bol^bins, and the next day took her first le.':.«on. The little Italian woman spoke no I]nglish, and Mrs. Weber's

Italian at that time was not of tiie oonversa- tional kind. The whole of the following day was spent struggling o\n- that narrow ])attern of torchon.

" It was quite the most hopeless thing I ever attemptetl," she says. "I could see, however, how it should be done, although I could not do it myself. At night my s])irits were at a low ebb, and I ached physically and mentally. The next morning, when I went to work again, the difficulties vanished, and I made several inches without a flaw. I took another lesson and learned a new pattern. I showed my teacher a l)it of Duchesse lace, and to my amazement she failed to even recognize it as jiillow lace. With my third lesson I found that I could see ' how to make every pattern my Italian lady had; and there were some fifty different laces, frf)ni half an inch to eight inches in width. I went home and proceeded to cut up some Duchesse lace under a microscope. I cut bliss- fully away, as the days went by, until I had sacrificed several dollars' worth, and had found out all but one thing — how to fasten the leaves together. Although they were not sewed, they were firmly joined; and still they were made in order, one at a time. For a long time the way was hidden.
