REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

ezor Atlaius, whoye wife was Aiiiie Boylston, sister to Susanna.

The wife of Josepli^ Adams and mother of Captain Ebenezer^ and Deacon John'' afore- said was Hannah Bass, daughter of John and Ruth (Alden) Bass and grand-chiughter of John Alden and his wife Priscilla. Sure enough, then, is Annie J'ields, poet and friend of poets, a "Mayflower" descendant.

Mrs. Fields's maternal grandparents were Captain John and Saraii (May) Holland, the grandfather a Boston merchant and ship- owner. The grandmother was a daughter of SamueP and Abigail (Williams) May. She was sister of Joseph'' May, wlio.se daughter Ai.iigaiP married Amos Bronson Alcott and was the mother of Louise May Alcott; and sister to Joseph" May's brother Sanuiel, who married Mary Goddard and was the father of Abby W. May of honored memory.

For years Mrs. James T. Fields has been one of the leading workers in the A.s.sociated Char- ities of Boston, in which organization she has served as vice-president and director, and as corresponding secretaiy of District No. 7, giving much time and energy to the study of social and economic (|uestions and the practical work of befriending the poor.

The writings of Mrs. Fields i)etray a cul- tivated mind, a wide ac&lt;iuaintanc4' and loving intimacy with books ami their producers, and possess a literary and person;d flavoi- of un- failing charm. It may be noted in passing that one of the teachers by whose instructions she profited in her youth was George B. I']merson, who for a number of years kept an excellent private school in Boston. Mrs. Fields has been a contributor to the Atlaiilic, Ilar/ier's, the CcnluTjj, and other magazines. Her first book of poems, "llnder the Olive," was followed l)y a memoir of her husband, entitled "James T. Fields: Biograjjliical Notes and Per.s(jnal Sketches, with Unpublished Fragments and Tributes of Men and W'omen of Letters," 1881; "How to help the Poor," 1883; "Whittier: Notes of his Life and Frien.l.ships," 1893: "A Shelf of Old Books," 1894: "The Singhig Shepherd, and Other Poems," 1895; "Authors and Friends," 1896; "Life and Letters of Harriet Beecher Stowe," 1897; "Hawthorne,"

in the Beacon Biographies, 1899 ; " Orpheus, a Mas(iue," 1899.

Early in the present year, 1904, after an interim of impaired health and cessation of literary activity, appeared from the pen of Mrs. P'ields a little volume on Charles Dudley Warner, in the Contemporary Men of Letters Series. What was said by a competent critic of her "Authors antl Friends" may here be cited as applicable to this attractive monograpli of later date: â€”

"It is because Mrs. Fields herself was born just early and just late enough, and through circumstance and native endowment came into the closest intimacy and sympathy with the men and women whose names shine forth most clearly in our century's record of letters, that her book has an unconunon charm and value."
