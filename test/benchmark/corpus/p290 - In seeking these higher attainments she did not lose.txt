In .seeking the.se higher attainments she did not lose her interest in the affairs of every-day life, but has continued to manifest that adapta- bility which enables one to accomplish what the hand finds to do. Her life from childhood has seemed one continuous effort and sacrifice for others. In the year LS71 she was called to a position in Boston, and a few years later she

married John G. Fales, of Thomaston, Me. From the time of her marriage she has lived in Boston and vicinity, her home since LS92 being in Cambridge, Mass. She was reared in the Baptist denomination, and afl^iliated with that church until she became a Christian Scien- tist. A devoted disciple, she gratefully bears testimony as follows: "From earliest remem- brance I longed to express that soul music in song which would convert the listener. Since embracing the science of Christianity as given in the Christian Science text-book, 'Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,' by Mrs. Eddy, I have in a measure realized that long- desired soul harmony 'with signs following,' not only in having been raisetl from invalidism, but through experiencing its invaluable spir- itual uplifting. In common with others who imbibe the spirit of this teaching, it has been my high privilege to show many the way to health ancl harmony, leading them to an under- standing of their true being as children of God. vSuch work has sought me to such an extent and the benefit afforded others has been so gratifying that all other ambitions have become secondary.

Her father's great - great - grandfather, David Bagg, was one of the pioneer settlers of Pittsfield, re- moving thither with others from Westfield, Mass., about the year 1763, only a few years after the building of the first log cabin in that locality.

In the Revolutionary War David Bagg was a soldier in Captain William Fran- cis's company, which marched to Albany, N.Y., January 14, 1776, by order of General Schuyler; an(l later he was a member of Lieu- tenant James Hubbard's company, which was ordered to Manchester on July 18, 1777.
