in London, and first printeil in the Journal of the Science of Osteopathy of February, 1900 : â€”

" Osteopathy was first formulated by An- drew T. Still, M.D., in 1874. He claimed that a natural flow of blood is health; that disease is the effect of local or general (listurl)ance of the blootl; that to excite the nerves causes the muscles to contract and compress the venous fiow of blood to the heart; and that the hones coukl be used as levers to relieve pressure on nerves and arteries.

"The name Osteopathy was applied to the new science on account of the fact that the displacement of bones occupied the first place in the category of causes or lesions producing diseased conditions. . . . The underlying factor is that of body order and physics tleveloped in comiection with animal mechanics. . . .

"Osteopathy attempts to specialize the me- chanical j3ruici])le in dealing with all kinds of curable diseases, acute as well as chronic, graduating pressure, tension, vibration, and all the mechanical forms of physical stimula- tion, in their application to muscles, bones, blood-vessels, nerves, and organs of the body, so as to gain therapeutic effects." It "repu- diates drugs as foreign to the organism."

The daughter of Arrington and Sarah (Brown) Gibson, .she is of the .seventh generation of the family founded by John Gibson, to whom land was granted in Caml)ridge (then called New- towne), August 4, 1634. The line of descent is: John'; John, Jr. ,M5orn about 1641; Timothy,' born about 1679; Reuben,* born in Sudtniry, 1725; Israel,'' born in Fitchburg, 1765; Arring- ton," born in Ashby in 1813; Adelaide Florence, born May 5, 1862.

John GiKson, Jr.,^ fourth child of John' and his wife Rebecca, .served in King Philip's War. He married in 16(&gt;S Rebecca Errington, daugh- ter of .\braham' and Rebecca (Cutler) Erring- ton, of Cambridge, and grand-daughter of Deacon Robert' Cutler, of Charlestown.

Deacon Timothy^ Gibson died in Stow, Mass., in 1757. His first wife, Rebecca, the mother of his twelve children, died in 1754. She was a daughter of Stephen^ and Sarah (Wootlward) Gates. Stephen' Gates, her grantl- fathcr, came over in the "Diligent" in 1638.

Reuben* Gibson was one of the four Gibson brothers who settled in that part of the old town of Lunenburg which in 1764 became Fitchburg. Reuben's farm of one hundretl acres, on Pearl Hill, was ileeded to him by his father in 1744. He was Sergeant in ('aptain Ebenezer Wood's company, which marched from Fitchburg on the Lexington alarm of April 19, 1775. In 1776 lie was chairman of the Committee on Safety and Correspomlence. From the records he appears to have been a Captain of militia. He and his brothers, it is said, wen; "all good fighting men, famous for great strength and courage." The house of his brother Isaac was a garrison house, the "Fort Gibson" of 1748, the time of the Indian raid on the town. Captain Reuben Gibson married at Sudbury in 1746 Lois Smitli, daugh- ter of Thomas and Elizabeth Smith and grand- daughter of John and Sarah (Hunt) Smith, of Sudbury.
