"If thou, ilear one, wert far away from me, And continents lay between, or oceans wide. When lone I knelt to j^ray at eventide, First on my lips would be my prayer for thee. And all the distance would as nothing be To swift-winged blessings that to thee would glide. Thou hast gone from me, and the grave doth hide Thee in a shadow wider than the wide sea; Yet, when I kneel at morn or eve to pray, Shall I not pray for thee? Ne'er can come A day I do not love thee: must I say No word of love? Thou livest, dear, somewhere. Whv, if the dead are deaf, must we be dumb?"
