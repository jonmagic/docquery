On June 12, 1890, he married Miss Elizabeth Hamilton Baten\an, of Portland, who was edu- cated at Mount Holyoke Seminary.

EVELYN GREENLEAF SUTHER- IjAND, writer, playwright, and critic, the only daughter of James Baker, for- merly a prominent wholesale merchant of Boston, and his wife, Rachel Arnold Green- leaf, was born and breil in Boston, as were her paternal ancestors for three or four generations. Her mother, who died in 1896, was a daughter of Spencer and Pamela (Adams) Greenleaf, of AViscasset, Me.

Mrs. Sutherland is descended on both sides from fighting stock, and inherits many inter- esting traditions. Her mother's paternal ances- try she traces to Captain P^dniund Greenleaf, who came from England and settled at New- bury in 1635, the line being; Edmund,' Stephen,^ ^ * Samuel,'^ Benjamin," Spencer.' Edmund Greenleaf marched against the Ind- ians in 1637. From that time to the death in 1857 of her grandfather, Spencer Greenleaf who served in the War of 1812, there was but one break in the military service of the family. Captain Stephen^ Greenleaf, son of Captain Edmund,' was one of the purchasers of Naii-

tucket island in 1659. He niairied in 1651 Elizabeth, daughter of Tristram ("ofhn, tlieii of Newbury, Mass., afterward the chief magis- trate, also one of the owners of Nantucket. Ste})hen- Greenleaf was drowned while engaged in the honorable discharge of liis military iluty in the expedition against Port Royal in Decem- ber, 1690. His son, Stephen,^ known as the "great Indian fighter," was engaged in King Philip's War, and in the contest with the French anil Indians in 1090 he commanded a companj' at Wells, Me. Mrs. Sutherland's great-grand- fathei', Benjamin" Greenleaf, was a soldier in the Revolution.

Several of these progenitors were seafarers, and were well known in New England as mas- ter ship-builders. It is recordetl that the origi- nal Greenleafs in England, ancestors of Edmund, were Huguenots (name in French Feuillevert), who had fled from France to escape religious persecution.

There is a tradition that one of the family, many generations back, while in France, mar- ried a Spanish Romany girl, or Gitana, and that the Gipsy blood now and then appears in her descendants. To this inheritance Mrs. Sutherland whimsically attributes her love of Bohemia and the freedom of outdoor life.

Noteworthy also is the part which the colonial Bakers took in the cause of liberty. Captain Joseph Baker, a surveyor, shared in the famous Lovewell hght in New Hamp- shire. His wife Hannah was the only daugh- ter of the noted Captain John Lovewell, who was killed in the battle of Pigwacket, May 8, 1725. Mrs. Baker received a share in the lands awardetl to the survivors and heirs of those engaged in the fight, and .settled with her husband on this land, where the Baker homestead now stands, in the town of Pem- broke, N.H. Their son, Jose]jh Baker, Jr., was a soldier in the Revolution, and was on the Conunittee of Safety for the town of Bow, N.H.
