REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

UCY BRIGHAM (HOriMER) FISHER was born in Fitchburg, Mass., March 24, 1S34, the oldest of five ehildreii of Silas and Delia (Gibbs) Hosnier. Her early life was in no way different from the aver- age of the time. Neither wealth nor poverty was the lot of the great body of the people, and the ojjportunities for develojjment and progress were fairly open to every one. She early man- ifested traits of character — among them a strong sense of justice and a conscientious regard for truth — which have since given her power and influence.

When sixteen years old, Lucy Brigham Hos- mer, at the solicitation of the school conunittee, became a teacher in the public schools of her native town. In this capacity she served with marked success for the nine years following. On February 12, 1860, she was mari'ied to Dr. Jabez Fisher, well known in the horticultural world. His two motherless children needed the fostering care which she could give, and most devotedly tlid she fulfil all the recjuire- ments of the situation.

Having entered the Sunday-school at the age of three years, and remained a constant jiupil until she was twenty, she then began her work as teacher in the Sunday-school of the First Universalist Church by assuming charge of the primary cla.ss of little girls. The gradual increase of oii|)ortunity which followed her suc- cessful early experience was of the most satis- factory nature. From that time to the ]ires- ent, a period of over fifty years, she has been a constant and im})ortant factor in the lives and characters of many hundreds of children. The primary department has constantly grown under her management, and, as now consti- tuted, embraces girls and t)oys from three to ten years of age; the numbers ranging from one hundred to one hundred and thirty. In many cases she has now in charge children whose father or mother or both parents were formerly under her instruction and are now teachers in some department of the school. On each returning Sunday she has the inspiring satisfaction of looking (he greater part of these children in the face, a most beautiful si^ht; and through her constant watchfuln(&gt;ss and well- directed efforts she controls, directs, and draws

out their young minds in the direction of truth, justice, and lovelinei^s of character. She re- sti'ains all that is wrong, and encourages all that is good and lovely. It is done so easily and naturally that the looker-on is charmed by the smoothness with which everything proceeds, and is not aware that any sjiccial effort is being used to this end. The time for closing the ex- ercises comes all too soon, and many linger to say pleasant words. She wins the love of most chiklren at once, and always retains the lasting respect of even those who are prone to rebel against her requirements, when they learn that such are exercised not by an autocrat, but by a friend whose only consideration is for their best development in character, and who will never consent to see them go wrong. One of her pastors thus emphasizes some of her char- acteristics : —
