Her brown hair fell ; But the marble Psyche there As soon would have heard my prayer,

My wild farewell.

'Twas the hush of an autumn noon, So clear that the waning moon Was a ghost in the skj- ;

Not a leaf on tlie lindens swayed, And even the brook in the glade Han, noiseless, by.

\l'/i(if had gone from the room, Leaving the sunshine gloom,

The soft air chill? If the tiniest bird bad llown, Its flight had a shadow thrown

On lawn and rill.

But neither a sound nor sight Disturbed the calm or the light

Of the noontide air ; Yet the friend I loved was as far As a ghostly moon or star

From my call and care.

Dead, with her hand in mine! Dead, in the golden shine

Of the autumn day! Dead, and no note in heaven Nor a gleam of white wings given

To mark her wayl

And my heart went up in the cry, '' How did the swift soul fly ?

What life inherit?" Then the wind blew sweet and was gone, And a voice said, " .So is one

Born of the Spirit.''''
