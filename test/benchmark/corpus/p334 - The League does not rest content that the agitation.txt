The League does not rest content that the agitation has abolished the long-approved gallows, nor does it accept as true that elec- trocution is one step in advance.

Mrs. Spooner has presented able arguments before the Joint Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature, has arranged many hearings, distributed literature, and written hundreds of articles upon the subject so near her heart. She has received numerous requests from libraries for copies of her sociological writings.

No higher estimate of this work of charity can be found than in the annual report of the

penal institutions commissioner to the mayor of the city of Boston in 1899, under the head of "Reform of Women Inmates." "A most encouraging work has been done by Mrs. Flor- ence Garrettson Spooner, the President of the Prison Reform League. Recognizing her earn- est sympathy for female prisoners, I appointed her in the early part of 1898 to do such work as missionary among the female inmates of the House of Correction as she might think proper looking toward their reformation. I have been nuich jiieased with hei' work there. The most hardened women have softened under the beneficent influence with which she has surrounded them. No better measure of her work can be shown than the decrease in the punisliments among the class with which she works."

In literary work and on the platform as a lecturer she is straightforward aiul perfectly at ease in discussing all phases and points of prison reform. Because of her tact, amiability, and encouragement to prisoners she has the confidence of officials and special privileges to study human nature from the inside of the prison, accorded to no other woman in the State, prison commissioners excepted.

She was appointed by Governor Greenhalge one of the colonial conmiittee of twelve from Massachusetts to the Cotton States and Inter- national Exposition at Atlanta, Ga. Mrs. Spooner is now in the prime of life and in active service. She has received the spontaneous co- operation of others in her noble work.

Her husband, Henry T. Spooner, a studious, busy man, devoted to his books, gives cordial sym])athy and practical suj)port to the work in which his wife is engaged. Mr. Spooner was boni in Brooklyn, N.Y., son of Henry Pierson and Emma (Brittan) Spooner. His father was a descendant of the Aldens, Germaynes, and Cottons. His mother was the daughter of Thomas Standfast Bi'ittan, a clergyman who left England and became rector of a church in Brooklyn.

In the annual report of the ])enal institutions commissioner, Alpheus Sanford writes to the Hon. Patrick A. Collins, Mayor of the city of Boston, that Mrs. Spooner was known through- out the House of Correction as the "women's

missionary friend," rcconunonding that the results of her work be recof^nized in future and designated the Florence Spooner Prison Mission.

"The initial and dominant impulse, abiding power, and persistent energy which characterize the reform work of Mrs. Spooner are not merely the result of humanitarian feelings and ijhilan- thropic tendencies. They are largely due to her vivid conception of the religious duty of helping the weak and erring in the spirit and purpose of the great evangelical teacher and model of brotherly love, all-embracing charity, and zeal for the happiness of human souls in time and eternity."
