David B. Morey was a cousin of Samuel Morey, from whom it is said that Fulton got his itleas of the steamboat. His wife, Almira

liailey, was daughter of Timothy Bailey, the first president of the First National Bank of Maiden.

In 1876 Mrs. Morey went abroad to pur- sue her studies in piano, organ, anil theory with Reinecke and Paul, of Leipsic, and Dr. Theodore Kullak, of Berlin. Subsequent seasons were spent in Rome, Florence, Milan, and Lon- don, in the study of vocal music and instru- mentation. Mrs. Morey in 1879 organized a chorus and orchestra, which she lierself con- ducted, being the first woman, sij far as is known, to use the conductor's baton. Her skill as a director and chorus leader is well known to the nuisical world; and, hail it not been for her extreme modesty and disinclination for pul)lic life, her name and fame would have been world-wide. There are few men, it has been said, among those famous in the world to-day, who have the skill to teach, or the magnetic personality to control and get results from a body of singers, which she i)o.ssesses. She has spent several seasons at Baireuth, and has been a close student of Wagner and his methods. Indeed, music has meant a life work to this re- markable woman. Through it she has striven to ennoble mankind by bringing to it a con- sciousness of those great thoughts which she conceives to be embodied in all art. As she says: "Music was never either an anuisement or an a?stheticism to me, but that solenm and ineffable voice in the .soul which has been proclaiming its messages down through the ages in all true art, whether in form, color, or sound." This .sentiment she brings out most emphatically in her lectures upon music, of which she has several.

Mrs. Morey has always ke])t herself in the background, but her jjupils, who are scattered throughout the land, can testify, as did one who has achieved fame in a large city: "I was one of Mrs. Morey's earliest pupils, and I have never forgotten either the impetus to work, the emulation of high ideals which .she instilled into me, or the inspiration which made study with her a delight."

AVhile she was director of music and organist of the First Church in Maiden, the musical critic of one of Boston's leading ])apers wrote the following in a report of one of the church scr-

vices: "Ak-ntion has not been inade of tlic organ jirclude nor of the handling of the organ throughout the solo and chorus work tiu'ough failure to ai)i)reciate the versatility and skill required in their execution. The gifted woman who has brought the music in this cluuch to rank with the first in the land, and who in the last ten years has done more to ennoble antl spiritualize the work of music in the church than any one within the writer's knowledge, brhigs to her position not only special aptitude, but skill acquired by intense and unrenutting study, an artistic style born of acf}uaint- anceshi]) with the best music of many ]ieo]iles and lands, and, what is still more im])ortant, a realization of the soul of things whicli finds utterance in the majestic strains of Te Deum and oratorio. . If the musical attractions of this church are sufficient to call the attention of musicians from Boston, who, like myself, come on all extra occasions and frequently at other times, purposely to hear its chorus singing, it is safe to say it nuist possess somc^ distinguishing excellence. I am only one of several who have expressed the opinion that, were this choir within Boston limits, the present church edifice would be entirely inadecjuate to seat the peojjle who would throng there to hear its music. Mrs. Morey combines genius and physical strength to a degree seldom found in woman, and from this union we expect and find great things."
