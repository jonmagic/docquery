For many years she was a member of the Congregational church, but during the last few years of her life she attended the Episcopal church. A writer saitl of her, " Her creed was much broader than that of any denomination. She observed strictly the Golden Rule, and hers were the charities that soothe and heal and

bless. The epitaph on her tombstone is truly expressive of her character: 'She loved to do good.'"

She was identified with the woman suffrage cause, and was the oldest woman voter for school connnittee in Brighton. The Woma7i's Journal, referring to her death, said: "The community has lost one of its most respected and beloved residents. Mrs. Harvey's illness covered a period of about nine weeks, during which time she did not lose, through her suffering, any of the deep and lov- ing interest which she had always taken in the lives of her children, friends, or the outside workl in general. She was a woman of deep and unquestioning faith, who led a broad and Christian life, of which her children and grand- children may well be proud. She shed about her an influence of unselfishness and piety which will bear fruit in the years to come. The Rev. A. A. Berle, D.D., who conducted the services at her funeral, spoke of the old- time belief and trust which characterized her life and of her deep anil earnest patriotism."
