" Within a few days both had started for their appointed fields, one toward the East and one to the West. As we count time, Miss Higgins's earthly service was short, for in eight months she had entered into her heavenly home; but in the sight of the Father her work still goes on in her influence, which lives in hundreds of hearts to-day. And, if we can judge by results, her mantle must have fallen on Miss Stone, for an added spirituality and fervor entered into her life, resulting in many ingatherings to the kingdom of Christ. . . .

"On reaching Samokov, Bulgaria, to which place Miss Stone was a.ssigned, she entered upon her duties in the Boarding-school for Girls, as assistant to Miss E. T. Maltbie, teach- ing English branches, while learning the new and difficult language.

" It seemed to the writer an incredibly short time when word came, ' Mi.ss Stone has conducted her first prayer-meeting in Bulgaria.' We soon learned that Bulgarian hearts were as susceptible to the power of Christ in one's

life, as Americans, and that her influence was most truly telling for His name. The same lovable traits of character so potent in America won the hearts of her young pupils, enabling her to lead them to their Saviour, as, with the other devoted missionaries of the station, she had her part in a most gratifying revival, that followed not many months after her coming to Bulgaria.

"After becoming familiar with the language, her field of usefulness widened, as the Board then appointed her superintendent of the 'Bible women,' who taught in the towns and villages of the country, that younger children (than the pupils at the boarding-school) and their mothers should be reached. These were native Bible women, converts to the Christian faith, and were in many cases gratluates from the school, who desired to prove the reality of their conversion in service. Their duty was to gather the children of the village into a school (held perhaps in one of the rooms of some humble home), to teach the common studies and the Bible, also to hold a Sunday- school for the children, prayer-meetings with the mothers, as well as to perform many pas- toral duties."

As these workers were appointed by and were under the instruction and guidance of Miss Stone, she visited them at regular in- tervals. Said Mrs. Atwood: "It is from other than Miss Stone's pen that we learn of the delight at her coming, the joy of the children who own her as 'Avmtie Stone,' and the great honor they count as theirs when she can be the guest at their homes. As Bulgaria is a country of 'magnificent distances,' these visits necessitate many tours over the mountains and plains, at the cost of great fatigue and dangers. But our friend ' counts it all gain,' as she has noted from year to year the glorious results, in the change from gross superstition, persecution, and ignorance, to the character of faithful, earnest followers of the 'meek and lowly Jesus.'
