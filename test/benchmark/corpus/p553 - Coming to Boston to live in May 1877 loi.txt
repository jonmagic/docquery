Coming to Boston to live in May, 1877, loi" five years she studied the piano with Mr. Orth. During the latter jjart of this period she taught large classes of i)ui)ils, and made many success- ful public appearances in concerts and recitals. She also studied harmony with the late Charles L. Capen.

In May, 1883, she was married to John Orth, her teacher. One of the happiest experiences of her wedding trip abroad was a stay of three weeks in Weimar, made memorable by many delightful afternoons in the salon of Liszt, who with his wonderful and never to be forgotten graciousness welcomed back his former pupil. Here Mrs. Orth met many aspiring students who have since become world famous, among them Alexander Siloti, Alfretl Reisenauer, and Arthur Friedheim. Arthur Bird, the American com])oser, was one of the " Lisztianer." The beautiful Mary F. Scott-Siddons, the English actress, was of the coterie, with her son, Henry A\'aller, the pianist. While in Stuttgart Mr. and Mrs. Orth went with friends of the sculptor Donsdorf to see his statue of Bach, just then completed and ready to be taken to Eisenach, the great master's birthplace, where in the following year it was unveiled. The genial sculptor later .sent to Mrs. Orth in Boston a cast from the small model of the Bach statue, dcnibtless the only one in this country. Dons- dorf also sent a cast of his large medallion heail of Robert Schumann, which forms part of the pedestal of the Beethoven monument at Bonn. At that time the sculptor had made but one other cast, which he had presented to Madame Clara Schumann.

From her marriage, in May, 1883, mitil May, 1895, Mrs. Orth's musical activity was confinecl to teaching her own and other children. While

she had always extemporized on the piano with freedom, she had never thought seriously of composition; but in May, 1895, witlviut warn- ing, forethought, or effort, the inner musical life began to express itself in this form. At first Mrs. Ojth's compositions were for the piano alone, and were naturally the outcome of her intimate knowledge of the musical needs of children. To the writing of music for children many seem to think themselves "called," but indeed few are by nature chosen. Sucli nuisic must^be naively simple, well defined in rhythm, and as spontaneous as a child itself. To write music of this type without triteness recjuires nothing less than a rare sort of genius. Ac- complished musicians, men famed for their work in larger forms, have tried this and failed. In- deed, it may be (|uestioned if any but a woman, a mother full of the child spirit, can ade((uately, lovingly, and sympathetically give musical ex- pression to that which appeals to the child heart. Mrs. Orth's work has clearly shown her to be one of the chosen few.

Perhaps the most original of all piano works for children is her "Mother Goose Songs with- out Words," Op. 5. This volume contains seventy little piano pieces in the exact rhythm of the Mother Goose rhymes, which are printed on the opposite pages, each number a tone miniature, grave or gay, quiet or sparkling, ac- cording to the story portrayed. The success of this musical volume and her delight in writ- ing it prompted Mrs. Orth later to the compo- sition of "Mother Goose's Jubilee," an opera for children, in three acts, which was performed with the greatest success at the Tremont The- atre, Boston, for a week in the spring of 1901. In the opera the tribe of Mother Goose assem- bles to celel)rate her jubilee. Tlie company is received by Mother Goose and Jack, her son, at her cottage in the wood, identified as the House that Jack Built. The characters speak, as they naturally would, the language of Mother Goose, the entire libretto, a unique feature, being based upon her rhymes and jingles. In its published form this opera, her Opus 12, a volume of sixty songs, is the largest collection of its kind in print. To group togeiher sixty short songs without suspicion of monotony is in itself an achievement.
