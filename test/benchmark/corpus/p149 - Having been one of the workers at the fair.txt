Having been one of the workers at the fair in aid of the Intemiierate Woman's Home, she joined with others in the formation of the Woman's Charity Club Hospital. Just as the

institution was to be opened with appropriate ceremonies, Miss Hatch was very ill with la grippe. A year later she fell and broke her right wrist, but she retained her office as sec- retary of the Hosi)ital I^oard, and accomplished the usual committee work.

The year 1888 proved unfortunate. Hav- ing passed three years at 60 Bowdoin Street, she spent time and money in the expectation of staying there years more. But, the place suddenly changing owners, she moved out, and stored her furniture.

As chairman of the nominating committee of women voters. Miss Hatch labored to secure a suitable list of men and women to report for the fall campaign. The A. P. A. element came to the front, and in some cases men as well as women joined it, but many soon left on learning its narrow and deceptive platform. Miss Hatch went to Washington in December, remaining there for several months. She there conceived the idea that the thing needed in Boston was concerted action by the women and men of a liberal turn of mind, to educate the people against the wave of narrowne.ss sweeping the State in the shape of lectures and literature. In letters to the old workers she explained this plan. The Rev. Samuel J. Barrows being in Washington the same .season, she conferred with him, and was greatly en- couraged by his approval and promise of aid. Mi.ss Hatch reached Boston in July in time to attend the meeting called to discuss this new plan. It proved a disappointment, as some of tho.se present advised that it be an organiza- tion of women. But wi.ser ways prevailed, and .soon the Citizens' Public School Union, composed of men antl women, was in working order, with Dr. Salome Merritt as president and Mrs-. Frances E. Billings (wife of the artist Billings) as the secretary. Meetings were hekl, literature printed and circulated, and in time much of the mischief was stamped out. After Mrs. Billings removed from the city, her place was filletl by Miss Hatch as long as she remainetl in Boston. In 1889, as delegate from the Woman's Charity Club, Miss Hatch became a member of the Committee of Council and Co-operation; and in the years following she held much of the time the office of clerk. When

Dr. Merritt pa.s.sed on, in November, 1900, Miss Hatch was unanimously elected chairman.

Having been brought up in the liberal at- mosphere of Unitarianism, Miss Hatch early became a member of the church and a teacher in the Sunday-school. To her early religious belief she added that of Spiritualism, of which she became a consistent and persistent student. Unwilling to encourage by her presence any sensational display, she was never found where any tloubt could exist of the genuinene.ss of the phenomena exhibited. Though neither clairvoyant nor clairaudient, she seemed always aware of the presence of spirit guides and friends, and talked with them in familiar style as if they were in the body. She has been heard to say, " My life woukl not have been worth living the last twenty-five years but for the con- stant help and conijianionship of my spirit friends."
