Mrs. Hamilton was one of those who vol- unteered to nurse the soldiers stricken with small-pox, which meant isolation from all but the patients. Sister Mary Xavier, a loyal, loving nurse, who was associated with her in the j)est department, died while in the per- formance of these duties. After the battle of th(&gt; Wilderness in the summer of 1864, small-pox again visited this hospital, and Mrs. Hamilton once more occupied the post of danger in caring for the patients. In No- vember, 1864, on account of failing health, she was obliged to leave the hospital, her inability to continue in the service being a great disappointment to her.

Mrs. Hamilton's interest in the men who saved the Union will never cease. The re- unions and other celebrations connected with the national encampments of the Grand Army of the Republic are occasions of great enjoy- ment, whenever she has the privilege of attend- ing them. She has been elected chaplain of the H. M. W^arren Relief Corps of Wakefiekl, Mass., several years in succession, and is highly esteemed by the comrades of the post to which this corps is auxiliary.

When the Army Nurse Association of Massa- chusetts was organized, in 1892, Mrs. Hamilton was chosen secretary, and has continued in the office. She was president of the National Army Nurse Association, having been elected at its annual meeting in Washington, D.C., in 1902. She is a member of the Ladies' Ai(l Association of the Massachusetts Soldiers' Home, and often visits this home in Chelsea.

She is a member of the First Baptist Church of Wakefield.
