it out at once. Miss McLean informed him that the names were familiar in the locality where she had been; but he was a young mem- ber of the hrm, and it was his first venture in publishing, as it was hers in novel-writing. The story, moreover, was ideal and not intended to be taken literally. For these reasons suffi- cient importance was not attached to the fact that local names were used. The book met with great favor, passing from edition to edi- tion. But presently the people on the Cape began to show that they felt themselves ag- grieved. This caused the author the keenest pain. She could not forgive henself then, nor can she now. Still there was "naught set down in malice," and surely the gracious pictures of their deeper experiences are depicted with so gentle a touch that it would seem the sketcher and the sketched might still across "the narrer neck o" land" clasp friendly hands. Her pub- lishers were desirous to have something further from her pen, and she hurriedly prepared a second book, "Towhead." Stories under her name appeared at intervals in various maga- zines, and a compilation of these formed her third volume, which was called " Some Other Folks." She had written two others, "Last- chance Junction" and "Leon Pontifex," when in 1887 she became the wife of Franklin Lynde Greene, a Westerner, educated at Annapolis. In the West, where she spent her married life of a few brief years, twin boys were born to her, but of these she was soon bereft. In 1890 Mr. (ireene died, and, widowed and childless, Mrs. Cireene returned to New England. Several ensuing years were passed in rest and travel. She took a European trip, and subseiiuently tarried at different points in Nova Scotia, vis- iting also various parts of Maine. It was after these summers in Maine that she wrote " Vesty of the Basins," a book that has had phenomenal success. In this ca.se, though local characters are sketched with a free hand, and the ilwellers in a small place know that their own manners and lives furnish the basis of the story, they read its pages with delight, and their frequent letters of appreciation show the deep love they bear the author. A well-known Engli,shman says of "Vesty" : " I have read it a dozen times, and 1 shall probably read it a dozen times

more. A\"ith each ic-reading I am struck anew with its wonderfully strong portrayals of char- acter and the sjiarkling wit and humor that alternate so subtly with the writer's (lee|-i, pathetic insight into life's mysteries. To my mind it is the great American novel." " Vesty," as well as "Cape Cod Folks," has been recently dramatized.

In fairly rapid succession Mrs. Greene wrote "Stuart and Bamboo," "The Moral Imbeciles," and "Flood Tide." In 1902 was published by Harper &amp; Brothers "Winslow Plain," a pict- ure of life in a quaint New England village fifty years ago, a story "told as Mrs. Greene alone can tell it, with the brightest ojitimism." In this book are found some rare poetic gems. One special charm, indeed, of all this writer's works consists in the many beautifvil, helpful pa.ssage.s — (juite aside from the enthralling in- terest of the story itself — that one desires, to read again and again. Said a certain apprecia- tive critic, " I never i-ead any of Mrs. Greene's stories without longing to see all these fine, quotable extracts collected in a volume by themselves, a volume to which I could turn whenever I feel 'the blues' coming on."
