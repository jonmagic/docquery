EMMA AUGUSTA GREELY, the head of the Greely School of Elocution and Dramatic Art, was born in Chelsea, Mass., March 12, 1869, daughter of John Lyman Greely and his wife, Octavia Augusta Stevens. Through her father's mother Miss Greely traces her ancestry back to Josiah Bartlett, of Kingston, N.H., signer of the Dec- laration of Independence, and through him to his immigrant progenitor, Richard' Bartlett, Sr., who in 1642 was one of the grantees of Newbury, Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Richard Bartlett is spoken of by his- torical writers of New England as "one of the Wiltshire colony who came over with the Rev. Thomas Parker in 1634." Of his birthplace and parentage he appears to have left no record, and vain the attempt with the little information available to trace his English antecedents. Mention, however, may here be made of an interesting relic now owned by one of his descendants, namely, a copy of the "Breeches Bible," purchased by Richard Bartlett, as certified in his own handwriting on the margin of one of its pages, in 1612 and brought by him to Newbury. On a blank page is his record of the births of his children— Joane, John, Thomas, Richard, Cris (Christopher), and Anne (New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. xl.).

The name Bartlett is said to be common in Wiltshire, Devonshire, Somersetshire, and other parts of England.

From Richard' Bartlett, of Newbury, the line descended through RichanP (born in Eng- land in 1621) and his wife Abigail; Richard,^ of Newbury, born in 1649, and his wife, Han- nah^ Emery — daughter of John^ and Mary (Webster) Emery — to Stephen,* born in New- bury in 1691, who married in 1712 Hannah, daughter of John^ Webster, of Newbury and Salisbury. Stephen'' Bartlett was Deacon of the first church of Amesbury. He died April 10, 1773, in his eighty-second year.

The Hon. Josiah Bartlett, M.D., the Rev- olutionary patriot, son of Deacon Stephen and Hannah (Webster) Bartlett, was born in Ames- bury, Mass., in 1729. He settled as a physi- cian in Kingston, N.H., where his old home- stead is still standing, being occupied by mem- bers of the family. He became Chief Justice of New Hampshire in 1788, was President of the State in 1790, 1791, and 1792, and in 1793, under the amended constitution of New Hamp- shire, was Governor. His wife was Mary Bart- lett, of Newton, N.H. They had nine chil- dren. The sons, Levi, Josiah, Jr., and Ezra, all became physicians. The line of descent to the subject of this sketch is through his daughter Mary, who riiarried Jonathan Greely, and whose son Josiah was father of John Lyman Greely, Miss Greely's father. The Greelys were prominent in public affairs in Kingston, and John Lyman Greely was at one time a member of the New Hampshire Legislature. His wife, Octavia A. Stevens, who was born in Brentwood, N.H., was also of an old New Hampshire family.

Enmia Augusta Greely had the misfortune at a very early age to lose her mother, but this sad loss was largely compensated by the de- voted care and sympathetic companionship of her father, to whom she owes her broad views of life and the development of some of her higher personal qualities, he being a man of lofty ideals, great sincerity of character, and decided business ability. She was edu- cated in the public schools, graduating from the Chelsea High School in 1887. Even dur- ing her school-days her inclination was toward
