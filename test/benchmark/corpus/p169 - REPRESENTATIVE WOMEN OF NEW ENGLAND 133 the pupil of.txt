the pupil of Signor Randeggei- and Madame Rudersdorf. She was connected with cjuar- tette choirs in Park Street, Old South, and Trinity and Emmanuel Churches, Boston. She was also soprano soloist in the Handel and Haydn Society and in the Cecilia Club.

She has travelled extensively in Europe, in her own country, and in Canada, and is a great lover of nature in its wildest grandeur. She recalls with enthusiasm her experience at Oberammergau, witnessing the Passion Play in 1900, al.so the first performance of Wagner's Nibelungenlied at Bayreuth, comlucted by the composer himself, in 1876.

The Wotnan't' Chronicle (issued as a supple- ment to the Cambridge Chronicle) in its issue of December 3, 1S9.S, thus referred to Mrs. Wellington's musical talents: "Music, an in- heritance from her parents, has been one of the chief inspirations of her life and a .solace to her sorrows. She was brought up antl nurt- ured in a musical atmosphere. Her mother's voice was remarkably sweet, and her father played several instruments, jiaying .special at- tention to the organ and piano. She cannot remember the time wlien she could not play the piano. Before she was tall enough to reach the keys, she stood on tiptoe to finger the melo- dies she had heard. Besides her fondness for classical music, from childhood martial music always appealed to her, as she was of a patri- otic nature." "

Since 1873 she has been actively interested as director in the Cambridge Conservatory of Music, on Lee Street, of which her father was the founder and proprietor. She had the honor of singing in one of the Montreal cathedrals, and has appeared as accompanist with Camilla Urso, the celebrated violinist. Many will re- member her in operettas and concerts for chari- table objects.

Mrs. Wellington considers it a pleasure and a duty to engage in the work of philanthropy, the objects of which are constantly knocking at our doors and our hearts with their confi- dential claims anil needs. No word of com- plaint or of unkindness is ever heard from her lips. In distributing for the flower mission and visiting the sick and in other forms of charitable work she is an enthusiast, as well as

in her musical career. Probably no woman in Cambridge is more generally known and loved than she. For several years she was on the music faculty at ^\'ellesley College and the New F^.iiglan(l Conservatory of Music.

Mrs. Wellington from her early youth has been interested in and connected with clubs, being recognized as a born organizer bj' her schoolmates, as later by her maturer friends. She has been entrusted with many responsible positions, notably the presidency of the Daugh- ters of Massachusetts, the Ladies' Aid Associ- ation of the Soldiers' Home, the South Middle- sex Unitarian Alliance Branches, the Wednes- day Club, and New England Conservatory Alunnii Association; the vice-presidency of the Charity Club, Massachusetts Volunteer Aid Association, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and Cantabrigia Club; has been secre- tary and treasurer of the Roundabout Club; director in the Cambridge Young Women's Christian Association, the Woman's Club-house Corporation, National Unitarian Women's Alli- ance Board, East End Christian Union: and one of the Parish Committee of the Austin Street Unitarian Church in Cambridge. She is a 'life member of other prominent organiza- tions, including the New England Woman's Club, Women's Educational and Industrial I^nion, and American Unitarian Association. She enjoys her membership in the Browning Society, Emer.son Society, Shakespeare Club, Boston Political Club, Suffrage League, Civil Service Reform Association, and Political Eciual- ity Club, and pays assessments in other clubs to attest her interest in tlieir work even if ]3re- ventetl from fre([uent attendance.
