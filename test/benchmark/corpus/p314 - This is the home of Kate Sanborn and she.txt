This is the home of Kate Sanborn; and she loves it, and delights to entertain her friends here, both the famed and the fameless.

One walks through the large sunny rooms, with books everywhere, quaint things in corners and odd places. There is a distaff full of flax

in a niche half-way up the stairway, and at its head a wool wheel, banded ready for use. Coming to the dining-room, one finds a great fireplace, never changed since the olden day when the house was built, immense fire-dogs, big bellows, tongs, and shovel, made in a primi- tive blacksmith's shop. Many a distinguished guest has chatteil and laughed by its crackling fire, many a merry group surrounded it. It is not a show place, but a home; and Miss San- born's hospitality is much larger than her acres. Sometimes it is a picnic party out from Boston, and always a guest in the house, often half a dozen. She is a good housekeeper and an excellent farmer.

She lives outdoors, makes her garden, and walks among the growing crops. Dogs and horses know the clear, wholesome ring of her voice, and come to be petted. Even the cows are a little more attentive when she calls. Only a womanly woman, a lady born and reared, could live her life of good cheer, literary en- vironment, and farming.

Miss Sanborn was eminently well born. Her father was Edwin D. Sanborn, who for prac- tically all his life held a professorship in Dart- mouth College. From LS37 to 1859 he occu- pieil with distinguished ability the chair of Latin language antl literature. In the last- named year he accepted the Latin professor- ship and presidency of Washington University, at St. Louis, returning four years later to the chair of oratory and literature at Dartmouth, which he held until he retired from active work. Plis was a very long, able, and distinguished career. In 1837 he married Mary A., daughter of Ezekiel Webster, of Boscawen, N.H., a niece of Daniel Webster.

Of this grandfather, Daniel says: "Ezekiel was witty, quick at repartee, his conversation full of illustrative anecdote." He was a man of wonderful presence. "In manly beauty," said Daniel, " he is inferior to no person that I ever saw." He was a model lawyer and a model man, simple and temperate.

His "Credo," which is preserved, is one of the most clear, simple, and perfect papers of its kind to be found in the annals of Christi- anity. All his leisure from business and his family was devoted to books. Lawyers who

were in court with him called him the peer of his illustrious brother, both in law and in oratory. His death in the very prime of man- hood made an intensely dramatic scene in the old Merrimack County court-house at Concord. Concluding a remarkable plea, he stood grace- fully for a moment while the court and his brothers of the bar were silent under the spell of his speech. Then he fell slowly backwanl to the floor, and was gone. ''What shadows we are, what shadows we pursue!" exclaimed George Sullivan, the illustrious Attorney-gen- eral of New Hampshire. He died April 10, 1829.
