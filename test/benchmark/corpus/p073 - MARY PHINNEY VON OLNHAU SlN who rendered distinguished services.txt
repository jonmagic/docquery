MARY PHINNEY VON OLNHAU- Sl'^N, who rendered distinguished services as an army nurse in two wars of the closing half of the nine- teenth century — the Civil War in America and the Franco-Prussian in Europe — and was one of the two American women upon whom the Emperor William conferred the decoration of honor known as the Iron Cross, was a native of ^Massachusetts, her birthplace being the historic town of Lexington. Born Februarj' 4, 1817, daughter of Elias and Catherine (Bart- lett) Phinney, she was the fifth in a family of ten children. Her father, Elias Phinney, A.M., (Harv. Coll. 1801), was born in Nova Scotia, whither his parents, Jienjamin I'hinney and his wife Susanna, had removed from Falmouth, Mass., a few years later coming, as the church reconls testify, to Lexington. He was of the Cape Cod family of Phinney (name sometimes spelled Finney), whose founder, John' Phiimey, was in Plymouth as early as 1638, and some years later settled in l^arnstable.

Mary Rogers, wife of John^ Phinney, was a daughter of Lieutenant Joseph" Rogers, of Dux- bury, Sandwich, and Eastham, who came over with his father, Thomas' Rogers, in the " May- flower" in 1620 ("Mayflower Descendant,'' vol. iii. p. 254).

In 1823 Elias Phinney settled on a farm in Lexington, which he brought to a high state of cultivation. For many years and till his death, in 1849, he was Clerk of the Mitldlesex County Courts. He married in 1809 Catherine, daughter of Dr. Josiah and Elizabeth (Call) Bartlett, of Charlestown, Mass. Her paternal grandfather, George Bartlett, a sea-ca]jtain, was a native of Devonshire, England.

Mary Phinney grew to womanhood in her native town, improving her opportunities for learning by attending an academy, and long after leaving school continuing her studies, especially of modern languages, till she became familiar with French, German, and Italian. She likewise cultivated her native talent for original work in drawing, becoming also an expert in embroidery. At the School of Design for women, started in Boston about the year 1852, of which she was one of the early pupils, "she was considered the best designer in the class," being numbered in subsecjuent years with Ellen Robbins and Margaret Foley as among those who had "distinguished them- selves in art." This is the testimony of Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney in her "Reminiscences," re- cently published, she having been Miss Little- hale, secretary of the school committee.

He had been connected with one of the great German universities, and Theodore Parker designated him as " the most profound scholar he had ever known." His feudal castle, which had been the home of his ancestors from the time of the Crusades, and has been described as "one of the most pictur-
