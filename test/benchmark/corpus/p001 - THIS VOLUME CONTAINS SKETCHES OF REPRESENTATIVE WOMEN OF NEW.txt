PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.

1

N presenting this book to our patrons, we think it fitting to state that the publication of such a vohune was first suggested to us by two ladies who have been since, for most of the time, closely associated with us in its com- pilation — Mrs. Mary A. Stimpson and Miss Mary E. Elliot. Their labors have been ably supplemented in this department and otherwise by Mrs. Martha S. Hoyt and others, to all of whom we owe a debt of thanks for faithful and efficient service. Our thanks are also due in high measure to Miss Mary H. Graves for her thorough and pains- taking work in connection with the editorial department and the verification of the geneal- ogies herein contained ; and to Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, the editor-in-chief, for her many wise suggestions, careful oversight, and valuable personal contributions of biographical matter. That the completion of the work has been delayed somewhat beyond the time at first anticipated has been due partly to the fact that the data for some of the biog- raphies, promised a long time since, were not furnished to us until quite recently, and also to the careful and thorough manner in which every department of the work has been carried on. That all will be fully satisfied we do not expect ; yet we believe that our subscribers in general will find little real cause for dissatisfaction, and in particular will this be true of those who readily and heartily co-operated with us in the preparation of their own biographies. The few who failed to do so will be httle entitled to complain of any errors or omissions in the matter personal to themselves herein printed. We believe the book will fulfil the reasonable expectations of all those who have taken a friendly interest in its pubhcation.

EDITOR'S PREFACE.

HE Ijiogiaphical sketches presented in this vohune are mostly (j1' an are still with us ami engaged in active pursuits which embrace variety of callings. The woman minister, doctor, lawyer, all have her" record, and with them the writer, the teacher, the philanthropist, the general care-; society.

The sketches naturally vary in importance and interest ; bnt, taken all together, t: offer a laudable report of the work of New F^ngland women in many departments &lt; pubhc and personal service. They attest the active interest of New England's daughtei in the welfare of the State and in all that most vitally concerns its citizens.

BIOSRAPHIGAb.

ELIZABETH CARY AGASSIZ,

the first President of Radcliffe College and its constant bene- factress, is destined, through the scholarship that bears her name and the hall which is to be erected in her honor on the college grounds, to be held in grateful, lasting remembrance as a pioneer advocate and promoter in the nineteenth century of the higher education of women. In former years, as the wife and helpmeet of a naturalist of world-wide reputation, and later as the editor of his Life and Correspondence, she was well known in literary and scientific circles. Her subsecjuent work as an educational leader brought her name more directly before the public; and the celebration in Decembei', 1902, in Sanders Theati'e, Cambridge, of the eightieth anniversary of her l)irth was widely reportetl in the papers as an occasion of general interest. Born in Boston, December 5, 1822, daughter of Thomas Graves and Mary (Perkins) Cary, she comes of long lines of New England ancestry, and personally bears witness to gentle blood and breeding. Her father, Thomas Graves Cary, A.M. (Harv. Coll. ISll"), was son of Sanmel^ and Sarah (Gray) Cary and grandson of Saniuel'* anil Margaret (Graves) Cary, all of Chelsea, Mass. His grandfather, Sanmel'* Cary, was descended from' James' Cary, of Charles- town, through Jonathan^ and Samuel.^ James' Cary came from England and settled in Charlestown in 1639. He was the seventh son of William Cary, who was Mayor of the city of Bristol, England, in 1611.
