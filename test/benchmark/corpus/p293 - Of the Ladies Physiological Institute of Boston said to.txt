Of the Ladies' Physiological Institute of Boston, said to be the oldest women's organi- zation in America, she has been the first vice- president for twenty-one years. The object of the Institute is to bring within the reach of women, by open lecture platform, in a simple way, such medical, hygienic, and physiological instruction as shall lead, by interesting them, to deeper study and usefuhiess reganling the health and welfare of those in their keeping.

Some of its charter members who lived to a ripe old age were bitterly opposed to woman suffrage, anil the fiuestion was debarred from its platform and discussions for many years. As the membership gradually included the modern woman with advanced ideas, the spirit of harmony between the elders and the later members is evidence of the wisdom, judgment, and tact of its official incumbents. Mrs. Smith still holds the position of first vice-president, fre&lt;|uently occupying the chair. None of her rulings are ever questioned, and a Boston daily paper says of her, "She is a thorough parlia- mentarian, and no possible tangle or mix-up in a meeting can faze her."

Mrs. Smith is also connected with the Woman's Relief Corps and with the Eastern Stcar, a Masonic association. Becoming nmch interested in the woman's suffrage movement after hearing in the seventies the strong, earnest words of JuHa Ward Howe and Lucy Stone on the subject, she innuediately joined the ranks, and labored in the cause with untiring zeal.

She was treasurer for many years of the Na- tional Woman Suffrage Association of Massa- chusetts, and several times went to Washing- ton as delegate to suffrage conventions.

Mrs. Smith was first vice-president of the Committee of Council and Co-operation, better known as the three C's, and in connection with the late Dr. Salome Merritt was instrumental in many public reformatory movements.

She generously opened her house two years for the use of the Boston Political Class, formetl by the National Woman Suffrage Association of Massachusetts, for the purpose of giving in- struction to women in the various departments of political economy, F]nglish common law, national and State constitutions, civil service, elections, nmnicipal affairs, and parliamentary law.

Dora Bascom Smith has a reputation as a public reader. She has on several occasions taken the part of leading lady in private theat- ricals, and has been instrumental in forwarding various entertainments, being always reatly to utilize her talents in response to ever-recur- ring calls for charity. She was a student of Professor Emerson, of the P^merson School of Oratory, but, independently of that training, she has a style of her (jwn, whose charm lies in its simplicity and purity, clear, reaching enun- ciation, and naturalness of ex])ression. She has given the Institute many delightful sessions, filling the absence of president or lecturer by readings or original productions. Her lecture on "Pearls and Patches," replete with character sketches and anecdote, made a strong and last- ing impression.

Her religious views are broad and liberal aiul practical, rather than .sentimental. She was a member of the Church of the Unity during the pastorate of the Rev. Dr. Minot J. Savage, and enjoyed his intimate acquaintance while he remained in Boston. The choice booklet, "Stray Arrows: Selections from M. J. Savage," compiled by Mrs. Smith, was published by her in 1886.
