She is, as was her father, an ardent believer in temperance. On her mother's side, also, Mrs. Hitchcock is of English descent. The English historian Atkyns says, "The family of Hale has been of ancient standing in this county, and always esteemed for their probity and charity." Illustrious names have crowned this family throughout its history, from Sir Matthew Hale, Lord C'hief Justice, to the patriot soldier, Nathan Hale and the beloved minister philan- thropist, the Rev. Dr. Eilward Everett Hale,

now chaplain of the United States Senate. Mrs. Hitchcock's great-grandfather Hale was a sur- geon in the Revolution, and her grandfather a drummer boy in the company with his father. Her mother was born, and lived until she was sixteen years old, on one of the rare spots on God's green earth, on the edge of a little lake called "Indian Pond," in the heart of our New England mountains, in Orford, N.H. After teaching in the little red school-house among the hills, she was called to Lowell, where, after having taught a few years, she married. Later she removed with her husband to Cambridge to educate the children. Here her daughter, Caroline Hanks, went through the public schools, and then entered the Harvard Annex, now Radcliffe College. After leaving college, she taught in the Harvard School until her marriage in 1887, when she went with her husband, Sanmel M. Hitchcock, to New York. She now lives with her son, James Hitchcock, on Harvard Street, Cambritlge.

A few years ago Mrs. Hitchcock became in- tensely interested in theosophy. She is now president of the Cambridge Lodge of the l^ni- versal Brotherhood Organization and Theo- sophical Society, whose head(iuarters are at Point Loma, Cal. Here the Children's Raja Yoga School is being carried on with marked success, and the School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Anticiuity has been already established under Katherine Tingley, of Newburyport, Mass. When asked the other day, "What are the Mysteries?" Mrs. Hitch- cock answered: "What, indeed, is there that is not a mystery? Is not life it-self the Great Mystery â€” life, this jjanoramic glimpse be- tween two vast silences? Raja Yoga is the Science of Life, the study by means of which we may come to understand the inner workings of that great law which has made brotherhood a fact in nature, and has made life joyful just in that degree that we recognize that the welfare of one is indissohibly and forever a part of the welfare of all. Tlieoso])hy is nior(&gt; than a name, more than a theory: it is a living, trans- forming ])()wer, that shall lift the whole world and fill all life with light and joy. It is the history of the mental, moral, and spiritual evo- lution of the sou! on this planet."

Mrs. Hitchcock believes that the future of the world rests in the hands of the little children. "At Point Loma hundreds of them," it is said, " gathered from many nations, are being trained in the atmosphere of love, the spiritual science of the soul. Music and art are the transform- ing powers of life, and here they are taught in their deepest- meaning. The power of beauti- ful expression comes from the arousing of the inner powers of the soul, which are in sym- pathy with whatever is high and pure. Many of these little children are homeless waifs, who are being instructed in the laws of Universal Nature and Justice, the laws governing their own being, and the wisdom of mutual helpful- ness. The children are taught to regard them- selves as integral and responsible parts of the nation to which they belong; to aspire to the position of national benefactors, teachers, and helpers, and so become exponents of the truest and wisest patriotism." Mrs. Hitchcock is also interested in the various branches of this .school, which are found in all the large centres of Amer- ica, as well as in her own Cambridge, where she works indefatigably with the children.
