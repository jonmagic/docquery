Miss Benneson's mother, Electa Ann Park Benneson, was a descendant of Richard Park, who came from England and was a proprietor in Cambridge, Mass., in ]6o5. His house stood "near the cow conmion," the land at present bounded by Linna\an Street, Garden Street, and Massachusetts Avenue. In 1647 he crossed the Charles River into that part of the town familiarly known as Cambridge A^illage (the territory since comprised in Brighton and New- ton), where he had eleven acres and a house within a few feet of the spot now occupied by the Eliot Church. A little to the north-west of this lay his large tract of six hundred acres, bordering on the Charles River. His only son, Thomas Park, inherited this estate, ^^'hen di- vided among his heirs, 1693-94, it comprised seven hundred twenty-two acres and part of a corn-mill on Smelt Brook.

Miss Benneson's grandfather, Daniel Har- rington Park, descended in the fourth genera- tion from Richard Park, was born in Massa- chusetts, but was taken, when in his second year, by his father to Connecticut. In man- hood he became a resident of \Vrmont, where he married \\'elthy Ladd. In that State, at South Royalton, Miss Benneson's mother was born.

^\'hen a young woman, Annie Park, as she was generally called, taught school for a few years near th(&gt; birthiilace of her father in Brighton, Mass. Some of its prominent citi- zens, once her pupils, still hold her instruc- tion in grateful remembrance. While visiting

frieiuls in Quiiicy, 111., she met Robert Benne- son, to whom she was afterward married, ami there they fouiuled their home. Their interests, whether eilueational, religious, or philanthropic, were identical. Mr. l^enneson valued his wife's sountl judgment and keen intuition in business matters above that of all other counsellors. Each respected the individuality of the other and of their children. They helped to estab- lish the Unitarian church in that section of the West, gave to it liberally both of their labor and of their means, and were devotetl to its interests throughout their lives. For many years Mrs. Benneson was superintendent of the Sunday-school. "Do right because it is right" was the keynote of her teaching. Her activity was not confined to her home and church. Any movement aiming at the good of the com- nmnity found in her a ready helper. In what- ever she undertook her foresight and execu- tive ability led her to be successful. She was much interested in the Woodland Home, an asylum for orphans and friendless, ami united all of the churches of her city in a large fair for its benefit, over which she presided. During the Civil War she devoted herself to the sol- diers' families and to the wounded in the hos- pitals, even receiving two from the latter into her own home, where they were cared for until convalescent.

Mrs. Benneson was always the same â€” self- sacrificing, courageous, forceful, not easily sur- prised, remarkably even-tempered and well- balanced. Her feelings found expression in deeds of kindliness rather than in words. She had scholarly instincts, rare literary taste, and constantly took up new studies. In the inter- vals of a busy life she wrote easily and well. That her children should excel in authorship would have been her greatest satisfaction.
