of York County. Dr. Day was likewise an early supporter of the Washingtonian move- ment, and probably was the first physician in this country to treat methomania as a disease. He was for thirty-six years (not consecutive) the superintendent of the Washingtonian Home in Boston. He died in April, 1894. This home, which has a national reputation, was organized in November, 1857, and in March, 1859, was incorporated by the State Legis- lature, receiving a grant of five thousand dol- lars. A new building on Waltham Street, erected for the home, was dedicated December 20, 1873. Many thousand patients were under the care of Dr. Day in the Washingtonian Home. It has been estimated that one-third of them were permanently cured, and more than half the remainder benefited. Dr. Day published a number of valuable works upon this subject.

During the war of the Rebellion, Dr. Day, as a member of the Boston School Board, as- sisted in establishing the first school for "con- trabands" or freedmen on this continent.

His son, Albert A. Day, in July, 1862, at the age of seventeen, enlisted in the Forty-third Regiment, Massachusetts ^^olunteers. He was First Sergeant of Company K, and served in the battle of Kinston and other engagements in North Carolina. At the expiration of nine months' term of service, " under an order is- sued July 7 rendering it optional with the men to go to the front or return home, two huntlred and three officers and men voted to go to the front" (Adjutant-general's report). Among these was Sergeant Day. When he came home at a later date, he brought with him a negro boy about twelve years old, who had escapetl from his master in North Carolina. The boy lived in the family of Dr. Day for many years, and was educated by the Doctor's daughter Cora, Mrs. Young. He is now in the service of Dr. Nichols, of Worcester. For several years he contributed to the support of his former mistress, a Mrs. Gregory, of ]']lizabeth City, N.C., who was aged and in destitute circum- stances.

At Wakefield, Mass., January 18, 1871, Cora Day was married to Charles L. Yomig, LL.D., of Buffalo, N.Y., a distinguished soldier

of the Civil AVar. His first service after being a Zouave Cadet in April, 1861, was in the Ex- celsior Brigade of New York under General Daniel 10. Sickles. Throughout the Peninsu- lar Camjxiign, A'iiginia, he served on the staff of General Joseph Hooker. He was promoted, and commanded his regiment during the sec- ond Bull Run, Pope's campaign, including the battles of Bristoe Station, Groveton, Bull Run or Manassas, and Chantilly. At the battle of Chancellorsville he was on the staff of Gen- eral Sickles, in the Inspector-general's depart- ment, with the rank of Major, and was desper- ately wounded. With his wound unhealed, he returned to the front, and was with Gen- eral Sickles when the latter lost his leg at Get- tysl)urg. He was again wounded in the Wil- derness, then in the Inspector-general's de- partment of General Winfiekl Scott Hancock. He was the last in command of his regiment in line of battle in the presence of the enemy. After the war Major Young was brevetted Lieutenant Colonel of Volunteers for meritori- ous services during the Civil War.
