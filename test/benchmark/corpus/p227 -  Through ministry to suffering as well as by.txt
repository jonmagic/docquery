" Through ministry to suffering, as well as by educational efforts, an effectual door was opened to the hearts and homes of these stran- gers, who are coming in such numbers to stay with us. Many of them are exposed to imposition and neglect, and are helpless to meet these conditions. By helping them when sick and unable to get work, they are ready to adopt better methods of living, and the children offer the best opportunity for making these people American. These little ones are bright and alert, and, taken into new environ- ments, they readily adapt themselves to new conditions. Thousands of these chiklren are crowded together in the tenements of our cities, and if we neglect them we shall bring upon ourselves the blame of the bad government of our cities, which these children will surely rule in a few years. By all means in our power, now is the time to make good Americans of them and then good loyal citizens, whose right to vote can neither be bought nor sold.

To do this we nmst get into close touch with the home life, and so get a firm hold upon these children and young i)eople. Ten years of this close work in the homes of these people, in sympathetic and friendly association, is already showing the very best results. A large class of young people are already taking an intelligent interest in everything that per- tains to the public interest of the North End. Young men and young women are seeking to do for the neighborhood what will be a powerful influence in the right direction. Many are studying to etjuip themselves for a useful and helpful life.

"The work brings its own reward; and, if any doubt that such methods are practical, let them spend a few days at 36 HuH Street, and see the varied plans and the all-round efforts to win the young people to adopt the best and become the best. There is a hearty co-operation among the many workers of this important part of the city with the excellent public schools and different institutions to make this the centre of a new and a renewed life for Boston."
