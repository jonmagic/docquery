An earnest supporter from the early days of the movement in New England for the enfran- chisement of women, Mrs. White has been active in organizing suffrage meetings and very hos- pitable in entertaining speakers, Lucy Stone,

Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Howe, and many others, having been her guests from time to time. She had in charge the New Hampshire tables at the .several suffrage bazaars held in Boston, and in various ways contributed to their suc- cess. A writer in the book entitled " New Hampshire Women" gives this summary of Mrs. White's helpful activities: —

"The charitable and benevolent associations of the State have ever been the object of her fostering care. She was the first president of the New Hampshire W. C. T. U., and has been president of the New Hampshire Woman's Suffrage Association since its organization. Largely through her efforts, coupled with her husband's, was secured the legislation enabling the New Hampshire women to vote and hold office in connection with school affairs. Mrs. White is a member of the board of trustees of the New Hampshire Centennial Home for the Aged, of the Orphans' Home in Franklin, and the Mercy Home in Manchester. She was ac- tive in their establishment, and has been a liberal supjwrter of each. The Universalist church in Concord and at large, and manifold charities, local and general, have ever com- manded her earnest sympathy and generous aid."
