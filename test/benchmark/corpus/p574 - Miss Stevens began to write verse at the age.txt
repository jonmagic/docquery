Miss Stevens began to write verse at the age of eight. Her first published work appeared in the Radiator, the Somerville High School paper, in 1882. She was a member of its editorial staff. Her early work, both stories and verse, was published in the Salem Ga- zette, Watchman, Golden Rule, the Stiver Cross, the Conlrihvtor, and other periodicals.

A sketch of this writer, under her maiden name, appears, with a selection from her writ- ings, in "Essex County Poets." Sidney Perley, Esq., of Salem, the publisher of this work, .says of her: "Her work is always meritorious, and she is well worthy of the niche we have given her in this volume, although the youngest of the poets on our list."

"Thoughts of Peace," a dainty little book of verse, and "Appointed Paths," a story for girls, have been published by James H. Earle, of Boston. These were pleasantly reviewed by

the Congregationalist and other papers. She has also written many poems for public occasions in her town, her poem written and read on the occasion of the dedicating of the new Town Hall being published in the History of Lynn- field. A poem written in honor of the naming of the Daniel Townsend Chapter of the Daugh- ters of the Revolution, Lyim, was read by her at the exercises in the old Town Hall of old "Lynn End" and afterward, by request, at an afternoon meeting of the D. A. R. at their headcjuarters in Boston. At the Old Home Day exercises of Lynnfield, held at Suntaug Lake in August, 1903, she also read a poem written for the occasion.

Miss Stevens was married November 28, 1889, to Mr. John Winslow Perkins, of L}'nn- field, and went to live in the pretty cottage built for the young couple on the Perkins farm, which has been in the family since 1700, this being the date of the erection of the home- stead. Mr. and Mrs. Perkins have one child, a boy of ten years, who has been given the family name, John.

Mrs. Perkins taught in the public school for a short time previous to her marriage, and has had many private pupils, in whom she has felt great interest, for she is very fond of young people, and finds nothing more delightful than the task of helping them to develop the powers with which they are individually endowed. The work of the teachers of our public schools is an especial study, and Mrs. Perkins is always enthusiastic in her appreciation of all that is being done for the home through the school. As editor of the department of "The Home and the School," in the Suburban, Boston, Mrs. Perkins is having an opportunity for foster- ing the much-desired co-operation of parents and teachers.

She was for a considerable time connected with the Daily Ereniiuj Item, Lynn, as cor- respondent from her town, sustaining very pleasant relations with that well-known paper, as also, in the same capacity, with the Citizen and Banner, Wakefield, and has been for a number of years doing regular work for the Normal Instructor, New York, contributing exercises, verse, reports, articles, and songs.
