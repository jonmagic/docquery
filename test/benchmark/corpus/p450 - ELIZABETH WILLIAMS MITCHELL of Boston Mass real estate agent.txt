Mrs. Mitchell began to attend the common schools in Newjjort, England, when she was about five years oKl, and continued her studies in the Salem schools until she was fourteen. At the age of twenty she came to Boston, and took the full covu'se at Comer's Business College, where she was graduated November 30, 1897. On December 2 she ailvertised in the Boston Herald for a position, and thereby obtained employment the next day with the E. J. Hammond Lumber Company in the Exchange Building. She left that place after three months to take a position with L. P. Hollander &amp; Co., dry goods merchants of Boston, but gave this up shortly to become private .secretary of Miss E. P. Sohier, the secretary of the Free Public Library Com- mission. Retaining this position, at the same time she accepted the office of agent for the Massachu.setts Volunteer Aid Association, in which Mi.ss Sohier was an active worker. As agent, besides attending to an unusually large correspondence, she had to investigate every case for relief called to the attention of the Association, visiting the dwellings of the objects of the relief, ascertaining what was needed, and, when the case was a worthy one, supplying the same, such as fuel, clothing, food, and lodging. In the performance of her duties she was frecjuently obliged to travel both in and out of the State.
