lear, was in the Thirty-second Regiment, Massa- chusetts Volunteers, during the Civil War; and her first work for the soldiers was in the early days of that conflict, when, as a school- girl, she heli)ed to scrape lint for use in the hos- pitals. Loyal to the Union and all the prin- ciples it represents, she never cea.sed her efforts for the "boys in blue." There was a revival of interest in A. W. Bartlett Relief Corps during her presidency, and she initiated over fifty members. Public meetings were held, also union gatherings with the post — socials and conferences that advanced the beneficent work of both organizations.

Serving as a delegate to the annual conven- tion of the Department of Massachusetts, W. R. C, in 1886, she became interested in its work throughout the State. Her efficiency and devotion were cjuickly recognized, and she received appointment on important conunittees representing the State work. The duties of Department Aide, of Assistant Inspector, ami of Installing Officer were performed by her with credit. For seventeen years she was an active worker for the State organization and a promi- nent participant in its annual conventions. Mrs. Usher was elected for two successive years as Department Chaplain of the Woman's Re- lief Corps of Massachusetts, and her reports containetl suggestions and recommendations of value.

She was deeply interested in the work of patriotic instruction, and at the annual conven- tion in 1901, held in Boston, was appointed to the office of Department Patriotic Instructor. A complete report of the work accomplished was given at the convention in 1902, and cov- ered twenty-four printed pages. Among the statistics it contained arc the following: —

Number of corps in Department 172

in the work of patriotic instruction, and that in responding to inquiries and in furnishing desired information she had written nearly two hundred letters and postals.

She recommended that all corps make a special effort to interest the superintendent, school hoard, and teachers, assuring them, when indifferent, that this is a national movement and that united action is earnestly desired.

In a circular issued to the corps for their guidance, she requested every president to co- operate with the assistant patriotic instructor of her corps in preparing for a patriotic exer- cise or entertainment, that their respective comimmities may realize their ambition to spread the lessons of patriotism among the children. She urged them to encourage the children to quietly salute the flag wherever they might see it.

"One of the best plans of creating an in- terest," she said, "is a public gathering, with the presence of the clergy and some of the prom- inent citizens as speakers. This should be arranged with a view of presenting the cause in a manner that will appeal to the hearts and minds of the people, and especially to those having the management of the public schools.
