In addition to her regular work she con- tinued her studies, forming classes at ilifferent times in French, German, art, literature, elo- cution, antl physical culture, before the days of women's clubs, and spending her vacations in travel. With a cultivated musical taste, she was for several years a pupil of the New England Conservatory of Music, and has been a member of various musical organizations, among them the Handel and Haytln, the Som- erville Musical Association, and the Newton Choral Association, which she was largely instrumental in organizing.

She was married February 14, 1884, to Alvin Richarils Bailey, a graduate of the Somerville High School and for many years president of the alumni of that school. Mr. Bailey is one of the intelligent and prosperous business men of Boston. His father, Joshua S. Bailey, was one of the first to ship crackers all over the world.

Since her marriage Mrs. Bailey has made her home in Newton. She is a member of the Channing Religious Society, has been a teacher in the Sunday-school for many years, assisting her husband in his duties as super-

intendent, serving also as president of the Ladies' Society and chairman of the Hospital- ity Committee. She is vice-president of the Social Science Club of Newton, Secretary of the Newton Fetleration of Women's Clubs, and the Shattuck Club of Boston, and has been a member of the West Newton Women's Edu- cational Club for sixteen years, serving most of that time as director, recording secretary, and now (1903) as president. vVmid these many and varied interests she has not been found wanting in patriotism, being a member of the Sarah Hull Chapter, D. R., of Newton, and of the National Society, D. A. R., and at pres- ent Regent of the Paul Revere Chapter, D. A. R., of Boston. These honors and many others with which her friends have testified to their high regard for her are doubly valued since they came unsought. That they are merited, no one will deny.

Her bright and cordial manner and her sym- pathetic nature have been powerful factors in the deserved success which she has achieved, and have helped to cheer and uplift those who have come within the influence of her personality.
