Elizabeth Porter Gould, the eldest daughter, was named for her grantimother Gould's sister Elizabeth, the wife of Dr. John Porter, of "Fairfields," the old Porter estate in Wenham. With Miss Gould the possession of talent has been a call for its improvement. The pleas- ant paths of learning in which her mental powers were developed easily led into equally pleasant fields of useful activity. Whenever congrat- ulated upon the many patriotic services she has rendered, she has always declared with her kinsman. Dr. Benjamin Apthorp Gould, that her "ancestry made it a necessity." And so in regard to her many acts of kindness, her in- telligent sympathy in behalf of so many causes, she simply says: "I was born in a house dedi- cated to God and humanity. I can't go back

on that." Questioned, she tells how the house in Manchester-by-the-Sea, where she first saw the light of this world, .June 8, 1848, was dedi- cated like a church by a kinsman of her mother's, who, on its completion, called together people frojn far and near for a service of prayer and praise.

An inspiring leader and adviser of clubs tlur- ing her long residence in Chelsea, after the club era began, she was also for years an intelligent power among the society women of Boston, Brookline, Newton, and other places, by her "Topic Talks," opportunities for which came to her wholly urtsolicited. In fact, they seemed to be thrust u])on her, for it was clearly noted that this author of varied learning and reserve force had the power of expressing herself in extemporaneous speech, as well as on paper, a rather rare gift.

â€¢As an officer in philanthroiMc and educational organizations, she has struck important chords in the line of reform. Her brochure, " How I became a Woman SufTragist," preluded a membership in the Massachusetts Woman Suf- frage Association, and led to the casting of her annual ballot at school board elections. As a director from the first of the Massachusetts Society for Good Citizenship, she entered by voice and pen into the good government work of that organization. As an officer for years of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women, her good judgment and wise counsel have been of service. As a mem- ber of the Woman's Board of Foreign Missions, she is able, as she says, to become a seed-sower in behalf of the broader education of foreign women. She has written convincingly in the interests of the American college on the Bos- phorus and in other lands. Her article in the Century for 1889 on " Pundita Ramabai" was but an outline of the lecture which, with those on "John and Abigail Adams," "John and Dorothy Hancock," "Holland and the United States," "The Brownings and America," and others, she has delivered before numerous women's clubs and other organizations. Her gratuitous platform work in behalf of the George Washington Memorial Association led her as far south as Richmond. Her lecture in Char- lottesville was the first ever delivered at
