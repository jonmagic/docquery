Clarence Barrett Benedict, lawyer, in Boston, married Millicent Emily Thompson, Deceml:)er 5, 1900.

Mrs. Benedict, as noted above, is the pres- ent Regent of the John Hancock Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She was admitted to membership as a great- grand-daughter of Benjamin White, who served in the war as a Lieutenant and later as Cap- tain, and assisted in the capture of Burgoyne. She has been a member of the New England Women's Club, is still a member of the Cas- tilian Club, and is one of the Board of Visitors to the New England Conservatory of Music.

She is particularly intcrestefl in the Con- servatory student.s, in behalf of whom she has exercised generous and cheering hospitality, taking great pleasure in befriending joung ladies and girls who were far away from their homes. In religion she is an Episcopalian, being a member of Trinity Church.

^NNE ELIZABETH MERRILL, who / \ ^has for many years occupied the posi- X ^ tion of Supervisor of Music in the pub- lic schools of Portland, Me., with much credit, is a native of that State, being one of the two surviving daughters of the late Cap- tain Samuel and Sarah Perkins (Sturgis) Ran- dall. The home of her parents for many years was in Riverside, formerly a part of Vassal- boro, Kennebec County. Her paternal grand- father, Benjamin Randall, was one of the pio- neer settlers of that town. His wife was Susan Cross. He was a lineal descendant of William Randall, who settled in Scituate, Mass., be- fore 1640. A Benjamin Randall is on record

as a private in Captain Bartholomew York's company, Colonel Edmund Phinney's regi- ment, at Fort George, December, 1776, also in the same company, July, 1777 (Massachu- setts Archives).

Captain Samuel Randall, shipmaster, was for a long period successfully engaged in voy- aging, but eventually through fire and ship- wreck he met with severe losses. Going to California to start afresh, he became master of a high-water steamboat on the Sacramento River. Nearly four years later, and after he had retrieved his fortune and his own boat was not running, he lost his life by a boiler explo- sion on a low-water steamer, on which at the request of a friend he had embarked as captain for a single trip. His property was in Cali- fornia, where he had made large investments, and his family was apparently well provided for. Monthly dividends for a time were regu- larly sent to Mrs. Randall, then in Portland. At length notice was received of a change of management, and after that no more remit- tances were received. Hence the straitened circumstances in which she passed her declining years, years of mental and physical infirmity.

Mrs. Randall was the daughter of Jonathan Sturgis and his wife, Melinda Hartwell Perkins. Jonathan Sturgis was a lineal descendant in the sixth generation of Edward' Sturgis, who emigrated from England about the year 1634, and in 1639 settled at Yarmouth, on Cape Cod. Edward^ Sturgis, son of Edward,' married Tem- perance Gorham, who was born in Marshfield, Mass., in 1646. She was a daughter of Captain John Gorham and his wife. Desire Howland. who was the daughter of John Howland and grand-daughter of John Tilly, both of whom came over in the "Mayflower" in 1620.
