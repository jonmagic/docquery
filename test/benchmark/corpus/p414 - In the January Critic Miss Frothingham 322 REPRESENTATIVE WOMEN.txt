REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

shows her power as an essayist, her article on Wilham Butler Yeats and his work toward the revival of Irish literature being one that to read is a delight. It is a noticeable thing in Miss Frothinghani's writing that she never seems to have "talked herself out": there is always evidence of resources in reserve.

Miss I'"rothinghani intends to make literature her profession. Another volume of fiction is in preparation. She is now (winter of 1904) in Paris, and later will move on to Sicily. Though the social demands of Boston's best circles upon her time are many, her tastes impel her to her library and desk, wlience, it is safe to prophesy, will come volumes from lier pen which will hold a place among the brilliant books of the present decade.

/iDDIE AUGUSTA NOTTAGE, who /\ has been active in patriotic and char- X jL itable work for more than forty years, is a native of Boston and a graduate of the Hancock School in that city. Her maiden name was Kingsbury. She was born April 5, 1839, daughter of Daniel W. and Sylvia (Wild) Kingsbury. Her maternal grandpar- ents were William and Sally (Thayer) Wild. On July 7, 1864, Addie A. Kingsbury was mar- ried to Josiah Marshall Nottage, a veteran of the Civil War. Mr. Nottage enlisted in the Eighth Massachusetts Battery. (Contracting a fever in the army, he was honorably discharged as an invalid, and in after life never fully re- gained his health. His &lt;leath occurred Sep- tember 13, 1894. Mr. Nottage was a member of John A. Hawes Po.st, No. 159, G. A. R., of East Boston. He was a son of Josiah and Tharce Lowd (Penniman) Nottage. His father was born in New Hampshire, and his mother in Braintree, Mass.

Mrs. Nottage has been active for a long time in the temperance cause. For fifteen years, iK'ginning in her girlhood, .she was identified with the Daughters of Rechab. This society, formed in March, lS4r), in Boston, was the first organized movement of woTuen for the pro- motion of temperance in Massachusetts. Its official title was "The Independent Order of the United Daughters of Rechab, " and sub-

ordinate societies were termed "tents." Its motto was Temperance, Fortitude, Justice, and its principles were founded upon the thirty- fifth chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. While temperance was the leading principle of the order, its members were bound by the strong- est ties of sisterly affection. To assist each other as "friends travelling together" was one of its objects. The society prospered for many years, and hundreds of tents were instituted throughout the country.

The Sons of Temperance and the Indepen- dent Order of Good Templars, formed a few years later, admitted women to membership and the Order of Rechabites decreased in num- bers, many of its members feeling that more effective work couUl be accomplished in the organizations formed on a broader basis. I'ntil a few years ago, however. State encamp- ments of the Daughters of Rechab were held semi-annually in Boston, continuing their ses- sions three and four days. The presiding officer was called "Worthy Senior Matron," and the chaplain bore the title of "Encamp- ment Shepherdess." Two tents in Boston, the North Star and Olive Branch, continued their work nearly forty years. Mrs. Nottage was Worthy Senior Matron of one of the Bos- ton tents. She also joined the Sons of Tem- perance, and for twenty years was active in Neptune Division, No. 29, of Boston, filling all the prominent offices.
