"SARAH BRADLEE FULTON.

"DoncHESTKR, 1740. Mkpford, 1835.

"The names of the men who fought in the war of the American Revolution are carefully

preserved in the archives of the State, luit the women who through all those sad years en- dured hardship and loss, and who toiled at the spinning-wheel and in the hospitals for their country's cause, have long ago been forgotten. Only here and there a woman's name is found on the roll of honor of Revolu- tionary days.

" Among the Metlford women whom history has remembered, Sarah Bradlee Fulton has a prominent place. We have been proud to name our chapter for her, honoring with her all the unknown loyal women who worked in this dear old town of ours for the cause of lib- erty.

" Mrs. Fulton was a member of the Bradlee family of Dorchester and Boston. In 1767 she married John Fvilton, and ten years later they came to Medford with their little sons and daughters, and made their home on the east side of Main Street, about one hundred and fifty feet south of the bridge, on the south side of what is now Tufts Place. Her lirother, Nathaniel Bradlee, lived in Boston, at the corner of Tremont and Hollis Streets. His carpenter's shop and his kitchen, on Saturday niglits, when friends and neighbors gathered to enjoy his codfish suppers, were meeting- places for Boston's most devoted patriots. From this shop a detachment of Mohawks who 'turned Boston Harlior into a teapot' went forth on their work of destruction. In the kitchen Mrs. Bradlee antl Mrs. Fulton dis- guised the master of the house and several of Ills comrades, and later heated water in the great copper boiler, and provided all that was needful to transform these Indians into re- spectable Bostonians. Natl^aniel Bradlee's principles were well known; and a spy, ho])ing to find some proof against him, i)eered in at the kitchen window, but saw these two women moving about so ciuietly antl naturally that he passed on, little dreaming what was really in ])rogress there.
