No pen portrait of Mrs. Kirby could convey to those unacquainted with her any idea of the personality that wins and keeps her many friends.

The Spanish have a maxim that he who eats fruit, and does not plant the seed, is ungrate- ful to the generation before him, and deals unjustly toward those who follow. In the great garden of God's world some sow, never expecting to reai): and, judged by the standard of the Spanish maxim, a sower like Mrs. Kirljy is fulfilling her duty to both the generation before and to those who follow her.

MABEL LOOMIS TODD, author and lecturer, the wife of Professor David P. TocUl, of Amherst College, was born in Cambridge, Mass., the only child of Eben Jenks and Mary Alden (Wilder) Loomis.

Her first American ancestor on her father's side was Joseph' Loomis, who came from Brain- tree, Englantl, in 1638, and settled at Windsor, Conn., in 1640. The sixth ancestor in that line was her father's grandfather, the Rev. Josiah" Loomis, of Stafford, Coim., and Ashfield, Mass.

Her maternal grandparents were the Rev. .John Wilder, Jr.,' and his wife, Mary Wales Folies Jones. The Rev. John Wilder, Sr.," (Dartmouth College, 1784), her great-grand- father, was for many years minister of the Con- gregational church in Attleboro, Mass. His wife, Esther Tyler, was daughter of Colonel Sanmel Tyler, of Preston, Conn., a Revolution- ary officer of note. The Wilder line is traced back through Jonas,^^ John,^^ to Thomas' Wilder, who became a member of the church in Charlestown, Mass., in 1640, and some years later removed to Lancaster, Mass. (See book of the Wilders.)

The Rev. John Wilder, Jr.' (Brown L'ni.'er- sity, 182.3), was settled in 1833 as pastor of the Trinitarian Congregational Church in Concord, Mass., where he remained six years. Three fine elms still standing in front of the old par- sonage in Concord were pl.anted by him, one for each of his three children. He died in 1844. His wife, Mary, the mother of Mrs. Loomis and grandmother of Mi's. Todd, was a daugh- ter of Nehemiah and Polly (Alden) Jones, of Raynham, Mass.

Through the last named ancestor Mrs. Todd is a tlescendant in the ninth generation of John Alden, who as proxy for Myles Standish wooed Priscilla Mullins, "the Mayflower of Plymouth" in the poet's talk, and won her for himself. The line from John and Priscilla continued through their son Joseph,^ who married Mary Simmons; John,' married Hannah White; Jo- seph,^ married Hannah Hall; Ebenezer,'^ mar- ried Ruth Fobes; Polly (or Mary)," married Ne- hemiah Jones; Mary Wales Fobes,' married the Rev.
