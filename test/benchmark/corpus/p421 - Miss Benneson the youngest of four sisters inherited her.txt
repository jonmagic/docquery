Mi,ss Benneson, the youngest of four sisters, inherited her father's physicjue and her mother's mental characteristics. She was a stui'dy child, orderly, accurate, self-reliant, aml)iti(jus, and persevering. Her mother, who studied all hei- children, soon perceived that the wisest way to direct her was as far as possible to answer her questions exactly and fully and to exi)lain to her principles and the relation of things. Under this loving guidance and in the companionship

of her sisters antl a young cousin who was one of the household, she had a happy childhood. Her happiness, however, was by no means passive. Diligent in all the activities that impel healthy young minds, she wrote ami studied with a zeal that might have put to shame much older heads. She had leai'iied to read before the family knew what she was about, and when she became ab.sorbed in a book one could call her name aloud without her hearing it, an experi- ment fretjuently made by the other children.

The five little girls hail many novel and in- genious ways of entertaining themselves. One of their enterprises was the editing of a maga- zine called The Experiment, which was reatl aloud every week in the family circle. In its columns appeared Miss Benneson's first writ- ings. At eight she contributed a satire on a fashionable woman's call, entitled "A Visit," which won the prize the mothei- had offered, '^o receive it the embarrassed author had to be dragged from under the bed, where she had hidtlen during the reading.

At nine, by her own request, her father al- lowed her to help keep his books. In his old ledgers are still to be seen her chiklish figures, correctly and carefully entered.

At twelve she was reading Latin at sight, had acquaintance with much of the best litera- ture, and was industriously collecting and tabu- lating historical facts. Her mother noted her ability to get at the pith of an argument and to sum up a conversation in a few words of her own. Permitted to take pencil and paper to church, she drew trees as she listened to the tliscour.ses, the trunk representing the text, or main thought, the branches the ideas leading out from it. In her judgment the merits of a sermon depended upon whether or not it could be " treed." At school she easily excelled other children of her age. At fifteen she had finished the course at the Quincy Academy, the equiva- lent of that of a good high school. At eighteen .she was gratluated from the (|)uincy Seminary. l'"rom that time until she entered college she had her full share of social life, of which her father's hou.se was a hospitable centre.

The homestead of the Bennesons is a large mansion situated above a series of terraces, surrounded by trees and shrubs, and conunand-

ing a magnificent view of fourteen miles of the Mississippi. To Miss Benneson, who was a good rower and knew everj' inlet and island of the neighboring river, it was a part of life. She watched with untiring interest the steamers plying to and fro between St. Louis and St. Paul, the flare of the pine torches when they neared the landings at night amidst the melo- dious chanting of the negro deck-hands, the varying moods of the restless stream itself in sunshine and in storm, its daily busy traffic and evening glow, and eagerly awaited its su- preme moment, when it tossed ofT the crashing ice-blocks in the spring, piling them high along shore. Whether seen from her windows or from her boat, the Mississippi had always for her a personality indelibly associated with her childhood and youth: it was her unconscious friend, helping her to think and act.
