sings in French, German, Italian, and i;lish, and has the proud distinction of lur the largest repertoire of any American sin also the largest collection of arias and c jstra scores for the concert stage. Miss iklin

has never repeated a programme in tl .• ame place, or an aria, unless called upon at a mo- ment's notice to sing without rehearsal.

In April, 1896, Miss Franklin married Mr. W. C. G. Salisbury, of Boston, and retired from public life to devote her time to teaching. As an instructor, she has been even more success- ful than as a singer. Her pupils are on the oper- atic, concert, and oratorio platform in Europe and America.

SARAH JANE BOYDEN was born in Chelsea, Ma.ss., July 17, 1842, the daugh- ter of Darius Allen and Sarah Ann (Han- son) Martin. When but six weeks old she was deprived through death of a mother's love and care, and, being a child of feeble health, it was feared she would not live to maturity. Her early education, obtained in the public schools of Chelsea and Boston, was supple- mented by a course of study in Bradford Acad- emy at Bratlford, Mass., and in Captain Samuel Hayden's private school in Braintree, Mass.

At the age of twenty she became the wife of Robert Curtis Davidson, of Chelsea. Just previous to their marriage Mr. Davidson had enlisted in Company C, Thirty-fifth Massachu- setts Regiment, to fight for the preservation of the Union. After two years' service in the army, he was wounded in the battle of Peters- burg, July 30, 1864, and died at City Point, Va., on the ISth of August following. In 1872 the subject of this sketch was again married, her .second husband being Walter Willington Boyden, of Roxbury. She is, the mother of two daughters, Gertrude Louise, Edith Ferdi- nand, and a son, Walter Allen.

From her father Mrs. Boyden inherited traits of character which have made her steadfast in purpose and firm in principle. Mr. Martin hekl the position of State Constable for years, and was noted for his courageous acts in closing the saloons in Chelsea. Mrs. Boj'den's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Albert H. Plumb, says of her: "I have known Mrs. Boytien for some thirty years. She is a living exemplification of the power to do and of the wisdom of doing two things at once, each being done better because the other is also in hand. In her own home and in the homes of the afflicted she has been a ministering angel. In the family, the church, in charitable and reformatory work, she has lived in all good

fidelity and zeal. In every sphere where she has moved she has shown great energy and administrative skill, a genial friendliness of spirit, and a genuine love for everything good. As one indication of the order of her house- hold, I have learned that during fourteen years of school life her daughter was never absent or tardy, save one half-day, and never missed a session of the Sunday-school in a still longer period. 'I used to think,' said Will Carleton, the poet, ' if my wife ever got to he a clul) woman, I would not live with her — much of the time. Since she has,' he added, 'I find I value her more than ever before — what there is of her.'
