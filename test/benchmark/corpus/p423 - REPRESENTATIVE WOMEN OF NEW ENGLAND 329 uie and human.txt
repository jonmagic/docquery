uie and human sympathy relax even the sto- lidity of a Chinaman. Doors opened easily to Miss Benneson, both those to the home and to the heart. Where .some would have seen only odd dress and curious customs, she found the spirit and motive of the real life. She was able to discriminate without being critical. The journey, too, was full of thrilling incidents, among them a camping expedition in the Yo- semite; horseback rides over the lava tracts to the Burning Lakes and down and up the steep walls of the gulches of Hawaii; the tour of Canton under English escort at the time of the Tonquin War; the elephant and dromedary rides m India and Egypt; the sight of the fa- mous Highland regiment, the Black Watch, marching out to battle, and the sound of the artillery fire of the British squares; a journey with the pilgrims returning after Easter from Jerusalem to Damascus; an adventure with brigands in Greece; the coming unawares upon the breathing Hermes of Praxiteles just un- earthed ; the mountain climbing in Switzerland ; the exploration of the Norwegian fjords.

Miss Benneson has the distinction of being one of the few that have visited the law courts of all of the principal civilized countries as well as their chief governing assemblies.

Upon her return, Miss Benneson lectured on her travels â€” first in her native city, where she gave an account of her entire journey, speak- ing seventeen times consecutively to deeply in- terested audiences; afterward in St. Paul, Min- neapolis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Boston, and many other cities. Her lectures, everywhere well attended, were found instructive by those who had travelled as well as by those who had not, for with her trained mind and keen per- ception she was able to give an interpretation as well as a narration of facts.

In 1886 Miss Benneson edited for a time the Law Reports of the West Publishing Company at St. Paul, Minn. In 1887 she accepted a call to a fellowship in history at Bryn Mawr College, where she remained until June, 1888. The fol- lowing September she came to Cambridge, returning not only to the seat of her ancestors, but unconsciously choosing a location near Richard Park's first house. She is environed by historic and literary associations, being mid-

Way between the Washington Elm and the Longfellow house, within a stone's throw of Radcliffe College and in sight of Harvard.

Miss Benneson did not find herself a stranger in Massachusetts. Kinsmen and old friends welcomed her. Among the new was Lucy Stone, in whose home she became a fre- quent guest, meeting there others of similar tastes.

In 1894 she was admitted to the bar in Massa- chusetts, and in the following year was ap- pointed special commissioner by Governor Greenhalge.

Various organizations attribute their success in large measure to the foresight of Miss Benne- son when framing their constitution and by- laws, notably the Unity Clubs of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Quincy, 111., which she founded, the College Club, and Woman's Club House Cor- poration of Boston, of which she was incorpo- rating counsel.
