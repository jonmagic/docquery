This was her first le.sson. She had but ten les.sons in all, although she was with me at other times talking freely, but not under in- struction. The plan was to develop at each lesson new elements, review those previously learnetl, listen to all of the combinations she could make with the consonants as initial and final elements, and construct sentences with the words resulting from the combinations. In the intervals between the les.sons she practised these with Miss Sullivan. She was an ideal pupil, for she followetl every direction with the utmost care, and seemed never to forget anything told her. On the day she had her seventh lesson (Aprl 19) she and Miss Sullivan were invited with me to lunch at the house of a friend. While on the way there Miss Sullivan remarked that she wished Helen woukl use the sentences she had learned, and added that she seemed unwilling to do so. It at once occurred to me that the cause of her reluctance was her con- scientious care to pronounce every word per- fectly; and so, in the moments I had with her during the visit, I encouraged her to talk freely with me while I refrained from making corrections. This hatl the desired effect. In going about the house of our friend she asked a great many ciuestions, using speech constantly. In the presence of all she told of her studies, her home, and her family. She also told of a visit to Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes a short time before, when she "talked" to him. Noticing her words as .she spoke, there were but four which I did not readily understand. The.se I asked her to spell on her fingers. Her enjoy- ment of this, her first experience in the real use of speech, was touchingly expressed in her re-

mark to Miss Sullivan on her way home, " I am not dumb now." In a conversation some two weeks later with Dr. Bell, Miss Sullivan, and myself, a still greater freedom in the use of speech was noticeable. Miss Sullivan fully appreciated the victory gained, for she wrote to Mr. Anagnos two months after Helen had taken her first lesson: "Think of it! Helen achieved in less than two months what it takes the pupils of schools for the deaf several years to accomplish, and then they do not sj^eak as plainly as she does." Helen's own joy in this conscious possession of a new power was shown in the following letter she wrote me a week or so after she had taken her first lesson. It also reveals the origin of her ilesire for speech.

South Boston, Mass., April .f. inno. My dkar ^[iss Filler:

My heart is full of joy this beautiful morning be- cause I have learned to speak many new words, and I can make a few sentences. Last evening I went out in the yard and spoke to the moon. I said, " () moon, come to me!" Do you think the lovely moon was glad that I could speak to lier ? llow glad my mother will be! I can hardly wait for June to come, I am so eager to speak to her and to my precious little sister. Mildred could not understand me when I spelled with my fingers, but now she will sit in my lap, and I will tell her many things to please her, and we shall be so happy together. Are you very, very happy l)ecause you can make so nianj- people happy ? I think you are very kind and jiatient, and I love you very dearly. My teacher told me Tuesday that you wanted to know how I came to wish to talk with my mouth. I will tell you all about it, for I remember my thoughts per- fectly. AVhen I was a very little child I used to sit in my mother's laji nearly all the time, because I was very timid, and did not like to be left by myself. And I would keep my little hand on her face all the while, because it amused me to feel her face and lips move when she talked with people. I did not know then what she was doing, for 1 was quite ignorant of all things. Then, when I was older, I learned to play with my nurse and the little negro children, and I noticed that they kept moving their lips like my mother, so I moved mine, too, but sometimes it made me angry, and I would hold my playmates' mouths very hard. I did not know then that it was very naughty to do so. After a long time my dear teacher came to me, and taught me to connnunicate with my fingers, and I was satisfied and happy. I5ut when I came to school in Boston 1 met some deaf jieople who talked with their mouths like all other people, and one day a lady wh" had been to Norway came to see me, and told me of a blind and deaf girl she had seen in that far-away land who had been taugiit to speak and
