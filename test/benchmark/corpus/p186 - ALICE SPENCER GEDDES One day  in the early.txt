ALICE SPENCER GEDDES.â€” One day

/\ in the early fall of 1898 a young X A. woman, a Freshman in Radcliffe Col- lege, received a letter asking her to call upon the editor of the largest and most influential paper in the city in which she lived. "I have noticed with approval," said the edi- tor, " the reports of the Cambridge Art Circle affairs, which you as clerk have sent in. Will you take charge of a woman's department in my paper?"

"What do you want in it? How shall I start about it? Do you think I can do it?" were some of the questions asked by the be- wilflered girl.

"I am too busy to answer questions. Will you furnish matter for eight columns of the Cambridge Chronicle a week from to-day?"

"Yes, sir, I will," came the prompt reply.

Thus it was that Miss Geddes was jjrecipi- tately plunged into the field of journalism.

She often jests now about the feeling of utter helplessness which overwhelmed her as she left

that editor's office, hut she knows that it was this very throwing of herself on her own re- sources that started her on her successful career. A week from that day the Woman'n Chronicle, supplement to the Cambridge Chronicle, ap- peared, containing an editorial by the young editor, setting forth the policy of the paper, which was not to be concerned with the senti- mental and useless matter usually crowding the so-called woman's pages of our large news- papers, but rather was to be devoted to educa- tional, philanthropic, and social activities of Cambriclge women. This first issue containefl a resume of all of these lines of work, illustrated with photographs of prominent women inter- ested in them.

From that time, save during the months of July antl August of each year, the Worn an' ft Chronicle as long as she edited it kept to the high ideals of the first issue, largely increased the circulation of the paper, and came to be recognized as the official organ of women's societies in Cambridge. All this Miss Geddes accomplished entirely unaided. She collected the matter, wrote the articles, and read the proof for each issue, and at the same time carried on the regular course at Radcliffe, and held the positions of clerk of th(&gt; Cambridge Art Circle and the Cantabrigia Club. Such were the beginnings of the career of a young woman who is now widely known, not only as an active worker in women's clubs and as a journalist, l)ut as a lecturer and class leader in all branches of English literature.

Alice S})encer Ceddes was born in Athol, Mass., Noveml)er 13, 1876, and was named for her paternal grandmother, with whom she spent her early years. In 187S the family moved to Cambridge; and in the following year her parents, William E. and Ella M. Ceddes, went to England to establish business there. As thej' intended to be absent but a .short time, the daughter was left in her grand- mother's charge. But, where success is, there is contentment; and Mr. and Mrs. Geddes took up their permanent residence in London. Ever since her babyhood, then, the daughter has lived in Cambridge in the winter and in Lon- don in the summer.
