Through her ancestry Mrs. Chapin is eligible to the Society of Daughters of the Revolution and that of the Colonial Dames; and, though her busy life does not permit of her active member- ship, she is often a speaker at their banquets. Mrs. Chapin's mental ecjuipment for a public speaker is enhanced by beauty, charm and dis- tinction of presence, and a voice of combined strength and flexibility.

As a lecturer she has made herself a special favorite, and her Thursday morning " con- ferences," given in her home, on the general theme of the art of higher and nobler living, draw select and enthusiastic hearers. Mrs. Chapin is still a young woman, and her ardent buoyancy of temperament, her fine poise, and exalted mental attitude combine to render her work and influence among the beneficent forces of the day.

her mother's side were Angus and Isabella C. (Gordon) Sutherland; on her father's side, John and Catherine (Mcintosh) MacKenzie, all Scottish Highlanders, belonging to old and distinguished clans. They migrated to Nova Scotia in the early part of the nineteenth cen- tury. The History of Pictou County states that Donald Mcintosh and Angus Sutherland took up their residence in the unbroken forest in the year 1813.

Angus Sutherland, the maternal grand- father above mentionetl, was one of the Suth- erlands of Sutherlandshire (in the extreme north of Scotland, south of Caithness), the head of which family for many generations bore the title of Earl, the line at length ending in an heiress, "Elizabeth Sutherland, Countess of Sutherland in her own right and proprie- tress of the greater part of Sutherlandshire," who married in 1785 George Granville Leveson Gower, the latter becoming in 1833 the first Duke of Sutherland.

The maternal grandmother, Isabella C, wife of Angus Sutherland, was the daughter of Robert and Christina (Arnot) Gordon. Her father is said to have sprung from the same stock as the distinguished British general, Charles George Gordon, known as "Chinese Gordon" â€” born at Woolwich, England, in 1833, son of William H. and Elizabeth (Enderby) Gordon and grandson of William A. and Anna M. (Clarke) Gordon-^whose great-grandfather, David Gordon, emigrated from Scotland after the battle of Culloden, and died in Halifax, N.S., in 1752.

Robert Gordon is believed to have been very nearly related to David Gordon. Alexander Gordon, son of Robert, was a paymaster in the Forty-second Highlanders (the "Black Watch"), and his brother Donald was band- master of the same regiment.

After various discouraging experiences in attempting to find a position for which she was fitted, she secured employment in the office of a laundry machinery company, be-
