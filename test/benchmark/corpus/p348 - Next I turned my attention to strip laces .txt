"Next I turned my attention to strip laces — Mechlin, Valenciennes, and English thread. Here, more than ever, I felt the lack of proper material. I hatl to resort to ravelling out the finest handkerchief linen and using the threads to acquire the technicpie of Mechlin and \'alen- ciennes. I made the lives of the shopkeepers miserable trying to get fine lace thread. Fi- nally one shopman asked his buyer to get me some, and I paid him eight dollars for what now costs me sixty cents. With this fine thread I succeeded m producing all kinds of fine laces by copying those I owned and others that were very kindly lent to me. I set about finding out where in Europe I could send for materials, and soon began to import all kinds of fine threads, bobbins, and pins."

One day, while Mrs. Welier was lof)king over an old I'lnglish book on lace, she came across a list of tools for lace-making. " Among them," she says, "was a tinj' hook, described as 'useful in drawing the threads through when joining

the leaves.' Here was the clew to the mystery which for three years I had been unable to solve — how the leaves and scrolls were fastened to- gether without being sewed."

About this time there were shown to Mrs. AVeber laces that had been left in an estate, to be sold by the executors. Among them was a great square of A'enctian point lace and a Duchesse lace skirt — a flounce four yards long and a yaril and an eighth deep, with twenty- four point lace medallions set into the pattern. These two large pieces of lace, too old-fashioned in shape to use, too modern to be of interest to collectors, were a problem to the trustees of the estate. She suggested that the lace was made of sniall i)ieces, and could be remade into small articles, making it salable. She was asked to figure the number of articles possible, the value when completed, and the cost of making them, and, having done this, was given the chance to do as she had suggested, with ])leasing results to all concerned. This brought her curious bits of mending from those who bought the laces. All kinds of lace work came to her, and she began to collect lace, aiming to make a representative collection of laces made at the present day.

The Arts and Crafts Society attracted her. She knew that among its members were those who had struggled with technical difficulties in various crafts. She applietl for membership, was received most pleasantly, listened to with interest, and at length w'as asked if it were possible to establish a lace industry here. Miss Anne Withington, the head of the W^omen's Residence of the South End Settlement, had become imbued with the idea of establishing some industries for girls and women, to be co- operative in plan and to give employment to girls of fine taste and ability, wdio would in this way be saved from hopeless drudgery in factories and shops. The industries were to be a refining influenc(&gt; in the neighborhood, and lace was to be one of them. She applied to the Arts and Crafts Society for a lace-maker the same week that Mrs. Weber joined the society.
