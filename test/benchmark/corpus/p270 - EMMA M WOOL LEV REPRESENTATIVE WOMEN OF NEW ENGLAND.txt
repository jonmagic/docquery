ity, she was a prolific writer. Several of her poems and short stories were publislied in the local papers. Many of her sterling qualities were tran.sniittetl to her daughter.

Emma M. Woolley enteied the Auhm-n High School in the fall of 1S75, and was graduated in June, 1879. Her ambition at this time was to study medicine, hut women doctors were not popular with her friends and kinsfolk. Their opposition anil the fact that her financial resources were limited caused her to adopt the more popular profession of teacher. After a service of six years in the country and vil- lage schools of Cayuga County she accepted a position in Americus, Kan., where she taught two years. She then continued her work as a teacher in Kansas City. Although a suc- cessful teacher, faithful in the performance of her iluties, she never accepted this occupation as her life work, but with unwavering trust looketl forward to the time when she could add to her name the title of M.D.

In the summer of 1888 she returned to her native town and spent her vacation with i)ar- ents and friends. In 1890, having decided, after due deliberation, to carry out her long- cherished plan of study, she matriculated at the Boston University School of Medicine. With only a few hundred dollars, which she had saved from her salary as a teacher, her means were limited; and, to eke them out during the four years necessary to complete the cour.se, she worked as a nurse many nights and in vacation. The money thus .earned, with the small sums furnished by a self-sacri- ficing mother, enabled her to meet her neces- sary expenses. In 1894 she was graduated, and received from the Boston University the coveted medical diploma.

She at once located herself as physician at No. 1 Columbus Square, Boston, renting the house she occupied and doing whatever came to her hands to do. Although a career of star- vation was predicted for her by some of her classmates, she set forth bravely, equip|)ed with a sound physical, mental, and moral nature and an indomitable will, l^nboundod energy and perseverance are the character- istics by which she has achieved her well- merited success.

In 19U1 she purchased the house at No. 867 Beacon Street, Boston, removing her office to this new home, where she gives the best -of her life to the relief of suffering humanity.
