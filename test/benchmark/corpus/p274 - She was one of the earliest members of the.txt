She was one of the earliest members of the New England Woman's Press Associa- tion, in which' she has held all offices except, the presidency, and she has been frequently urged to take that. Her services are in fre- qumt demand on different important com- mittees of the association. She represented it one year at the convention of the International League of Press Clubs, and' has four times been a delegate to the National Editorial Association, having twice responded to invitations to pre- pare papers for its progranunes.

Mrs. Whitaker was invited to prepare a paper for the World's Fair Press Congress in Chicago in 1893 on "Three Quarters of a Century in Agricultural Journalism." This paper was received with much approbation. She was also selected for a similar congress at the exposition at Atlanta.

Her writings have always been popular be- cau.se they are based on actual experience, and because they eliminate the purely imaginative or what is merely theoretical. " If Mrs. Whitaker said so, it is so " is a fre(|uent comment about articles which appear over her name. Her style is marked by clearness, vigor, and terseness. Her meaning is- always evident, and no words are wasted in getting at it. This is a great desideratum in newspaper work.

Mrs. Whitaker's prominence as a writer and authority on domestic topics has created a demand for her services in a number of direc- tions growing out of, but allied to, her special work. She was at one time employed by the Bay State Agricultural Society to organize a series of travelling cooking-schools in coun- try towns. She plaimed and successfully man-

aged a Household Institute in connection with the great Food Fair in Boston in 1897. She is freciuently in demand as an expert judge at fairs.

Although Mrs. Whitaker's chief claim to prominence is in her newspaper work, she is well known as a club woman. The many brill- iant functions of the New England Woman's Press Association always give prominence to its officers, and this prominence has been em- phasized in her case by the many years that she has been officially connected with the association. She was a leading spirit in the organization of the Winthrop Woman's Club and its first president. Her experience and executive ability did much to start it on a sound basis and to give it a recognized stand- ing among sister clubs. On her resignation she was elected an honorary life member. She was also a member of the Cooking Teach- ers' Club during its existence, and was one of the charter members of the Boston Business League. She served the League as secretary antl treasurer, and was e'ected an honorary member. For several 'y^'ifs she has been a member of the Arts and Crafts Committee of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.

She is the mother of two daughters: Lillian, who is now living; and Ethel, who died at the age of twenty-three. F]thel Whitaker was an artist of rare promise, who had already won a recognizeil position in art and been much com])limented as an exhibitor at the exhibi- tions of the Boston Art Club and others of etjual standing. She was a co-worker with her mother, whose work she illustrated in dif- ferent daily and other pul)lications. Her pre- matine death was acknowledged by the critics to be a less to the art world.
