Reuben, who were on board, were sent to Dartmoor Prison, being afterward released.

After the war was over, Joseph Young succeeded in retrieving his losses. It is re- lated of him that he accumulated a handsome property for his time. He reared a large family, six daughters and three sons, and was a very prominent citizen of Chatham, holding all the highest othces in the town and serving several years in the Legislature. He built a cotton factory in Harwich and a woollen fac- tory m Chatham, and was, in fact, a leader in any enterprise that would help the community. He was very public-spirited, and was liberal in his benefactions to the poor. No one was ever turned away from his (loor empty-handed.

A firm believer in the tloctrine of universal salvation, he contributed largely to the building of the first L^niversalist meeting-house on Cape Cod. Joseph Young, Jr., was born February 20, 1796, and died November 27, 1869. Isaac B. Young, his son, who is now (1904) eighty-six yeais old and the last sur- vivor of his branch of the family, is an honored citizen of Chatham. His youngest brother, George W. Young, died August 5, 1903. Maria J. Marston Young, wife of Isaac B., died January 3, 1894. She was a daughter of Arthur B. and Hannah J. (Jones) Marston, of West Barnstable, Cape Cod, Mass.

Helen C. Mulford was educated in the public schools of Chatham, and before sixteen years of age began a successful career as a teacher. Siie liad tlie love and respect of all her pupils, and li(M' poiiuiarity among them was an evi- dence of her kindness, lier good judgment, and ability in dealing with tho.se under her charge. She was engaged in this profession for several years, and among her most devoted friends are some of her former pupils.

On July 14, 1864, she married Joseph W. Mulford, an Acting Ensign in the United States navy. Since her marriage Mrs. Mulford has resided in Boston and Taunton, Mass. (where she conducted a millinery and fancy goods business), and Bridgewater, and for several years has lived at her father's home in Chat- ham, Mass.

grandfather was one of the founders. She early became interested ui the woman suffrage movement and in temperance work, and for the past nine years has been County Super- intentlent of the Franchise Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. She has supplied tliirteen towns with litera- ture upon the subject, has conducted an ex- tensive correspondence, and aided the cause in many other ways. Mrs. Mulford not only takes an active interest in every move- ment for the atlvancement of women, but also in the efforts for good government and for the public schools. A local paper, referring to the campaign of 1891, said: "The women of Chatham have been carrying on a vigorous campaign under the leadership of Mrs. Helen Mulford. The town was districted in Septem- ber, over seventy were assessed and i-egis- tered, and nearly all voted. A correspontl- ent writes: 'Mrs. Mulford deserves unbovmded credit for her work, for the campaign was a perfect success, and is so acknowledged by the men, notwithstanding that nothing whatever was done in the matter until the mitldle of September. The women took hold with zeal, and, though quiet and womanly in their work, were determinetl to carry it through. The best and most iafiuential women, younger and older, cast their votes. The interest in town meeting was never so intense, as shown from the fact that more men voted than for four years. We shall do still lietter next year. All honor to the women of Chatham.'"
