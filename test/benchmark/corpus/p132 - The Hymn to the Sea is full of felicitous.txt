"The 'Hymn to the Sea' is full of felicitous phrasing, also rich in picturesque effects. That this Hymn loses no jot of its regal resonance in the presence of its subject, but interprets and is interpreted best there, is its highest praise. It is certainly the finest single piece among the poems, though 'Camille' (first pub- lished in the Atlantic, vol. i.) affects us more, from its warmer hvmianity and the better de- veloped power it exhibits. There is no fault to be found with 'Camille.' It is the work of an artist. Its pathos is unsurpassed. . . . The keynote of this poem is struck most clearly in the fourth stanza: —

" 'To .swell some vast refrain beyond the sun, The very weed breathed niiLsic from its sod: And night and day, in ceaseless antiphon,

Rolled off throiigh windless arches in the broad Abyss. Thou saw'st I too Would in my place have blent accord as true, And justified this great enshrining, (JodP

"The three chief faults of these poems are obscurity, lack of euphony, and defect of ar- tistic polish." However, "there are no words woven to conceal the absence of thought: on the other hand, the line teems with more sig- nificance than it can express. . . . We ovight

in justice to say that the artist's soul is keenly representetl, especially in the 'Five Sonnets Relating to Beauty,' most worthily so entitletl. In these the love of beauty is a passion. ... In beauty is found the reconciliation of pain and jov, the riddle of the earth, the secret of the sea."

Referring to the sonnets entitled "Niglit" as "the heart of the book": "All through the preceding pages has rvm the golden cord on which the.se gay, many-colored beads are strung — a pure, high, and profounil religious love. . . . A truth, never so keenly felt as at the present day, revolves in all its phrases here — the ne- cessity of joy in faith, the (luintessence of the text, 'Rejoice evermore.' "

Higher attainments in verse were looked for by Miss Whitney's friends, but, so far as the world knows, she had sung her last note. Her genius called her in another direction. A heap of wet sand in the greenhouse responded to a thought in her brain to which she at once sought to give visible form. The success of this at- tempt at modelling was so gratifying that she resolved to devote herself thenceforth to sculpt- ure. For a long time, in the absence of teach- ers, .she was self-taught.. Working at home in a studio in the garden, she made portrait busts of her father and mother and of several friends. Her first ideal work was a statue in marble of Lady Godiva of Coventry, a beau- tiful figure. Her next creation — during the period of the Civil War— was a symbolical work, "Africa," a colossal statue of a woman who has been sleeping for ages, and is now half-awakened by the tramj) of armies, the roar of artillery, and the din of battle. In her look of startled wonder and hope, as with her right hand she shades her eyes from the too power- ful light, is foreshadowed the deliverance of a race held in bondage, the illumination of a dark continent. Exhibited both in Boston and in New York, "it received," says Mrs. Livermore, "some intelligent and some ex- travagant praise, as did the Godiva, and also much criticism, which its a\ithor welcomed."
