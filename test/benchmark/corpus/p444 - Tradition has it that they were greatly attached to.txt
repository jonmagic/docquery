Tradition has it that they were greatly attached to each other, each frequently de- claring that he did not want to know of the other's death. The Indians, so the story runs, planned to kill them both, and accord- ingly lay in wait for them one morning, one at each house. Hearing the shot that killed his brother, the other ran to the door and was himself instantly shot, so that they tlied within five minutes of each other. The "Jour- nal of Rev. John Pike," minister in Dover at that time, relates the incident somewhat differently, recording under date of June 4, 1706: "George Riccar and Maturin Riccar of Cocheco were slain by Indians. George was killed while running up the lane near the garrison; Maturin was killed in his field, and his little son Noah carried away." The first narrative, however, is that ]iassed down the line by Jabez Ricker, the grandson of Maturin. Noah, the child captured, was taken to Canada, where he became a Catholic priest. After the massacre of the brothers their families left Dover P«int, and went to Garrison House Hill in Somersworth, N.H., there being seven garrison houses near together.

Miss Ricker's line of descent from Maturin' is through Joseph," Jabez,' Wentworth,^ Albert G.'' (born in 1812, married Charlotte Schillinger, of Poland), and Wentworth Pottle" Ricker, her father (a cousin of the Rickers of Poland Spring House), who married Dorcas Ann Merrill, daughter of Leonard Merrill, one of the influential men of Falmouth and a descendant of Cajitain James Merrill, who settled there early in the eighteenth century. The old homestead, erected in . 1727, was Miss Ricker's birthplace, and is at present occujjied by her family.

The stanch patriotism and hberaUty of James Merrill and his neighbors at New Casco, as the part of the town where they lived was called, is shown by the following letter, which, accompanied b\- fourteen cords of wood, was sent to 8anmcl Adams, Esq., chairman of the conmiittoc for the poor of Boston in the troubled times preceding the outbreak of the Revolution: —

"March 11, [/"TS. Gentlemen: We herewith transmit to you by Captain Wormwcll and Captain Lock some wood, which we cheerfully give to our suffering brethren that are now standing in the gap between us and slavery. We are but few in numbers and of small ability, and, as we earn our bread by the sweat of our brow, shall ever hold in utter detestation both men and measures that would rob us of the fruits of our toils, and are ready with our labors, with our lives, and with our estates to stand or fall in the common cause of liberty. And if we fall we shall die like men and Chris- tians and enjoy the glorious privileges of the sons of Cod.

"This from your humble servants of said Parish, New Casco: Sanmel Cobb, Nathaniel Carl, James Merrill."

The sterling qualities exhibited by Captain Merrill have been transmitted to his descend- ants, wIkj have been leaders in all matters of progress and occupied positions of trust.
