At the time of his death, June 20, 1874, he was etlitor of the Unitarian Review.

Mr. and Mrs. Lowe had two daughters, both of whom are married and live in Somerville. Mrs. Lowe survived her husbantl many years, her earthly life closing at her pleasant home on Spring Hill, May 7, 1902. She was devoted to the higher interests of Somerville, and during her long resilience in that city slie substantially aided its charities and schools. In appreciation of her services in behalf of educational projects the school board, soon after her death, named a new building in her memory.

Mrs. Lowe often participated in public gath- erings, and accepted invitations to read original poems on special occasions. She was a fre- ([uent contributor to papers and magazines, and made many earnest appeals for the cause of charity, temperance, woman suffrage, and other objects connected with the public welfare.

She was the author of "The Olive and the Pine," a volume of poems published in 1859; " Ivove in Spain, and Other Poems"; "The Story of Chief Joseph"; "Bessie Gray"; Me- moir of Charles Lowe; and a book of Easter poems, called "The Innnortals."

"Mrs. Lowe was ever giving out, thinking, writing, expressing her thought. She would be inditing a poem, composing an article for the Unitarian Revieip, the Chrititian Register, or the local journal, making an address at the Alliance, the Educational Union, the Woman's Suffrage Club. In this way she kept herself alive, alert, in touch with the great world and
