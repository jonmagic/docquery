been done by her on various journals and magazines.

Among Miss Clark's possessions are artistic gifts, whose unfoldment and exercise are held in abeyance by the more important humanita- rian impulse and need. She has crossed the continent ten times, and visited every State and Territory in the Union, even Alaska being to her familiar ground. It is perhaps safe for the writer to ]jredict that the major por- tion of Miss Clark's spiritual and literary work still awaits her. c. s. c.

1IZZIK ALLEN PACKARD was born in Falmouth, Me., in 1853, the daugh- ^ ter of Reulien Allen and his wife, Emily J. Allen, who was a woman of sterling character.

Lizzie Allen was educated in the public schools of her native town and at Westbrook Seminary, where she was a student for two years. She was married in March, 1872, to Samuel Adams Packard, who belongs to a well-known Maine family, and who is one of the oldest active practitioners of dentistry in Portland. Seven chiklren have been born of their union, and six of them are living.

Socially Mrs. Packard is a favorite, and takes an interest in all the (juestions of the ilay. She is a woman of attractive personality, and makes an excellent presitling officer. She is now president of the A. B. C. Klass, a woman's club which has an interesting history, and is named for Mrs. A. B. C. Keene, a cultivated woman, formerly of Bangor, under whose leadership in that city the earlier classes for home study were formed. Mrs. Packard is also treasurer of the Mentone Club, which, since its inception six years ago, has had for its course of study the history of Maine. P'or some years Mrs. Packard has been active in the work of the Samaritan Association, one of the oldest charities in Portland. Conspicuous among her good deeds is the efficient work she did during . tlie year 1899 in the line of school-room deco- ration. Any stranger going into the Deering High School or the Saunders Street Primary School finds evidence of nmch thorough,

painstaking labor, the walls being adorned with valuable pictures, which delight and educate the pupils. It was no easy matter to obtain these. Mrs. Packard knows how many hours of persuasive talking were needed at first to arouse any enthusiasm, how per- sistently contributions were sought, and what numerous entertainments were given before funds were forthcoming with which to purchase them. During this year of exacting toil she proved herself an energetic and untiring worker. The results are certainly gratifying. During the eleven years that Dr. Packard was a member of the Deering Board of Edu- cation, he found his wife always interestetl in the plans which pointed toward better methods and higher aims in the local .schools. Essentially a lover of children, she is am- 'bitious for them, and rejoices in their ever- increasing advantages.

Mrs. Packard has always proved herself a devoted home-maker and housekeeper. In her private life those who know her best esteem her most. Dr. and Mrs. Packard attend the Congregational church.
