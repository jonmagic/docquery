P.\ULiNR J. Walden, chosen at the meeting in Philadelphia in November, 1882, to succeed Mrs. Daggett as the publishing agent of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, entered at once upon the duties of this position. As publisher of the four periodicals above men- tioned and general manager of affairs at the Bromfield Street office, she has shown herself thoroughly qualified to administer the trusts committed to her charge, and can perhnps be best described in the words of a Boston business man of forty years' experience, "Why, accord- ing to her opportunity, she's one of the best business men in the city." She, too, is a New England woman. Born in Lynn, Mass., she is of mingled Methodist and Quaker ancestry. In the simimer of 1897 she visited England and Europe for the purpose of studying mis- sionary work, giving considerable time to the work of the Woman's Foreign Mission- ary Society in Rome. In the spring and sum- mer of 1903 she made a tour to the Pacific coast, visiting California, Oregon, and Washing- ton, embracing the Columbia River and Pacific Branches of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, in the interests of the work. The total monthly output of the four periodicals is now (December, 1903) over ninety-five thousand.

Among her ancestors on both sides were some who held responsible jiositions in early colonial life and some who served in the war for indepen- dence. She is therefore eligible to membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Society of Colonial Dames. Miss San- born accjuired her elementary education in the little red school-house of the district in which she lived. Her family moving to the suburbs of Augusta when she was ten years old, she had a few yeai's of such teaching as the country schools then afforded. During this time she had plenty of good books anfl news- papers to read at home.

Stress of circvmistances sent each child of the household as a wage-earner, and at the age of fourteen the cotton-mill in Augusta became the scene of her labors. Wearying of the monotony' and small pay in that locality, she went to Lawrence, Mass., where she was em- ployed in the Pacific Print Works. The free library connected with this place afforded Miss Sanborn the greatest pleasure. She speaks enthusiastically of the benefits derived from its use.

The year LS61 found her at home in Augusta with her mother and the younger children, as the men had all "gone to the war." For a few months she worked on soldiers' coats; but this labor was not satisfactory, and plans were marie for learning type-setting, then a comparatively new business for women. With fair success this occu|)ation was followed for five years, when failing health compelled its abandon- ment. Circumstances opened a way for sew-
