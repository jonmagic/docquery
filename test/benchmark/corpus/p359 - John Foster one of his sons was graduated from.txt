John Foster, one of his sons, was graduated from Harvard College in 1667, excelling in math- ematics. In 1675 he established the first printing-press in Boston. He compiled an almanac for that year, which was printed by Samuel Green, and he was author and printer of the Boston Almanacs for 1676-81. He also made the seal of the colony. He died in 1681, and his gravestone, bearing a curious device, can still be seen in the old cemetery at Up- ham's Corner, Dorchester. He left no chil- dren.

Miss Foster's paternal grandfather, John Hancock Foster, son of Hopestill Foster of the fourth generation (Hopestill,^ James^) and his wife Susan, daughter of David Wood, was born in a house that formerly stood at the south-east corner of Hollis and Washington Streets, Boston, which he afterward inherited. In this house, in 1814, he was married to Miss Elizabeth Allen, of Boston, and within its walls both he and his wife died. The property was ]xn'chased from Governor Belcher over two hundred years ago, and is still in the posses- sion of John Hancock Foster's heirs. In this house was held the first meeting relative to the formation of the Hollis Street Church.

Miss I'"oster is nuieh iidei'csted in musie, is a painter of considerable note, also an author, something of a club woman, and member of various societies, of which, i)erhaps, Ium' favor- ite ones are the i^ostonian, of which she is a life meml)er, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which also she is a life member, and the Actors' Church Alliance. Her heart is large, and can hold a great deal, as her friends will testify. She is never happier than when doing something for others.

Of a re- tiring natiu'c and always remaining somewhat in tlie background, she is a true-hearted Amer- ican, anil interested in everv good cause.
