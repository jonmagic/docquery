Thus writes one who knows: —

"Although Mrs. Potter's preferences are decidedly for literary work, slie has always been sought for church, charitable, and philanthropic enterprises. She has been a leatler and emi- nently successful in them all.

"She and her husband were for fourteen years workers in Harvartl Church, Brookline, until the cry came from a weaker society, struggling unsuccessfully to get a footing in the same town, to come over and help them. They gave of their money, but that was not enougfi. The personal element and influence was needed, or there could be no hope of suc- cess. The result was, they left their own home church, joined forces with the weaker society, and the beautiful St. Mark's Church of Brookline is to-day a monument to their fidelity and devotion.

"Mrs. Potter has been for years the treasurer of the Brookline Woman's Exchange, treasurer of the Massachusetts Home for Intemperate Women, treasurer of the First Needlework Guild of Boston, vice-president of the Boston Business League, a member of the New Eng- land Woman's Club, the Castilian and Charity Clubs, the New England Woman's Press Asso- ciation, and the Club House Corporation Club, of which she has just been elected president.

Feeling that responsibility is the exacting companion of capacity and power, her business and executive ability are conse- crated, that she may render the greatest possible good to the greatest number. She devotes the best of herself in all that she undertakes. Few women have a wider acquaintance." ,

As facetiously noted by Mrs. Abba Goold Woolson at the dedication, it was owing to the firm faith and active assistance of an Isa- bella that the continent of America was dis- covered, and it was through the opportune "discovery of an Isabella" a few years ago that had been achieved the present happy result — the fulfilment of long-cherished hopes wherefore club women of Boston and vicinity have reason to feel grateful.
