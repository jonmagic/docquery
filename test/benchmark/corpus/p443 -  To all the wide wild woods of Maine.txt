" To all the wide, wild woods of Maine The singinj; birds have come again; In thickets dense and skyward bough Their nests of love are builded now; And daybreak hears one blithesome strain From ail the wide, wild woods of Maine.

■' In all the deep, green woods of Maine The myriad wild flowers wake again; On mossy knoll, by whispering rill, Their new life opens, shy and still; Unseen, unknown, as spring days wane, They sweeten all the woods of Maine.

" The fair and fragrant woods of Maine! To dwellers far on shore and plain The forest's breath of healing flows In every wandering wind that blows; And life throbs fresh in every vein Where bloom the boundless woods of Maine."

The book opens with a long poem, "The Heart of Katahclin," suggesting the very atmosphere of Maine's kingUest mountain. Following it are a series of lyrical memories, seven in num- ber, entitled "Midsunuiier on Mount Desert." The .collection includes also tlie poem read at tlie unveiling of the copy of the W(&gt;stmiiister Abbey bust of the jtoet Longfellow in Port- land, "Me., in LSSf).

The second half of the volume contains jjoems written fluring her residence in Califor- nia, in many instances suggested by its scenery, its associations, and especially by its beauty and ])romise. Such poems as "The New Italv," "Los Angeles," "Mount Hamilton," and "Ves- pers at San Juan" show her quick intuition of the forces around her and her swift divination of the future they were sha|)ing. Yet it is evi- dent that her thoughts were always straying to more familiar tilings and to remembered scenes.

And it came to pass that out of this longing remembrance of home, out of the sorrows that one after another came to her in these later years, and out of the long (piiescence of a linger- ing physical helplessness, of which one or two of her later poems give most i)athetic reminder, there were born a nol)le patience, a serene and sufficing trust, a larger and devouter thought, hallowing all that she had wrought before.

KATHERINE MAY RICKER, one of the most ])opular of the younger contralto singers of New England, is a member of one of the oldest and best known families of Maine, the Rickers of Poland Springs. They are of "ancient lineage, descending from the feudal and knightly family of Riccar in Saxony in the fourteenth century." The motto of the Riccar arms (now in the possession of the Poland Sjirings branch and said to be well attested) was "Sai)ientia domun Dei," "Wisdom the gift of God." Members of this Saxon family settled in later times on the Island of Jersey, whence came George and Maturin Riccar, brothers, the ancestors of most, if not all, of the name in America, a numerous and

widely scattered progeny. George, the elder brother, was the first to come, advised, it is believed, by Parson Reyner. He settled at Cocheco, now Dover, N.H., about the year 1670. Maturin, from whom is descended the subject of this sketch, followed a few years later. Both married here, and reared families, George being the father of nine children and Maturin of at least four. They lived near together in garrison houses on Dover Point.
