ELLEN BEALE MOREY was born in Orfonlvillc, Grafton County, N.H., tlaughter of Royal and Josephine (Johnson) Beal. Through her father she claims descent from Jonathan Carver, the traveller, who ex])lored in 1766-68 the region immetliately .west and north-west of the Great Lakes, then inhabited only by Indians, with whom he was in most friendly relations. The story of his receiving from them the gift of a large tract of land, including the sites of the present cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, though not found in the sketches of Mr. Carver in tiie biographical cyclopaedias, has in recent years been given newspaper pub- licity. The deed is said to have been re- corded upon a rock in a cave near the Falls of St. Anthony. Jonathan Carver died in London in 1780. He had gone there to make arrangements for the publication of a book giving an account of his travels and explora- tions (a few copies of which are now in exist- ence), and also, it is said, to try to secure a regular deed of the land granted to him by the Indians.
