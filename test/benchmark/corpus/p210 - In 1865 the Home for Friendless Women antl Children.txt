In 1865 the Home for Friendless Women antl Children was organized. Mrs. Calkins became a manager in 1867, and for the ten succeeding years was active in its work, serv- ing on the Children's Conunittee.

In 1877 she was appointed by Governor Rice one of an advisory board of three women to the State Board of Charities, and was its chairman, its duties being to inspect quarterly the Tewskbury almshouse and the State primary and reform schools, and report upon the same. The following year the advisory board was abolished, and its members ap- pointed as trustees of the same institutions, where tlirect power rather than advisory could be exercised. Heretofore the trustees govern- ing State institutions, except those for women only, were composed entirely of men.

Mrs. Calkins being appointed on the trustee board of the State primary and reform schools, the State primary at once engaged her most careful attention. This congregate institution, with its system of herding hundretls of chil- dren together with the fewest possible chances for the right develo]Mnent of mind and body, had appealed to Mrs. Calkins while a member of the advi.sory board as a subject Un reform.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

In her now position she interested lier ussoeiate trustees, the State Boanl of Charities, and the local press in the matter. As a result the man- agement was radically changed, and by act of Legislature, 1879-80, the young wards of the State between four and ten years of age might be placed at board in suitable families.

Mrs. Calkins declined reappointment as a trustee in July, 1880, anil accepted appoint- ment on a newly created board of auxiliary visitors to the vState Board of Charities, con- sisting of five women. The object of the or- ganization was to secure voluntary women visitors in different sections of the State to visit regularly the dependent and delinquent children ])laced in families. More than fifty women engaged in the work. Up to this time all official visitors of State children were men.

Mrs. Calkins also accepted at this time the responsil)ility of beginning the work of plac- ing young children at board in Western Massa- chusetts and visiting them quarterly. In this voluntary work she continued until the sum- mer of 1883, when the success and growth of the work necessitated the entire time of a supervising visitor, and, a salaried officer l)eing appointed, Mrs. Calkins retired.

In 1878 Mrs. Calkins took uj) the work of the Union Relief Association, then established in Springfield for the purpose of preventing pauperism by helping the poor to help them- selves, and was among its first corps of visitors. Its first notable work was the investigation of the condition of the city almshouse, and as a result she was soon after included in a committee to go before the Legislature to urge a change in the law regarding children in alm.s- houses, so that no young child could be i)lace(l in an almshouse without its mother. Out of this successful movement grew the present Hampden County Children's Aid Society.
