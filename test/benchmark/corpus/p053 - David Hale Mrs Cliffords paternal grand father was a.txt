David Hale, Mrs. Clifford's paternal grand- father, was a native of Harvanl, Mass., horn in 1772, and a lineal descendant in the sixth generation of Thomas' Hale, the immigrant progenitor of this branch of the Hale family in New England, who settled at Newbury, Mas- sachusetts Bay Colony, about 1637. Davitl Hale married Sally Kingsbury, of Ellington, Conn., daughter of Simon Kingsbury, and liveil in Rutland, Mass , until their removal to Turner, Oxford County, Me., in 1802. They made the voyage of three weeks from Boston to Fal- mouth (Portland) in the winter sea^son, in a sailing-vessel, and were obliged to leave their two chililren in Falmouth until sunuuer, since it was not practicable earlier to take them forty miles through the woods.

The Kingsburys were a remarkable family intellectually, and Sally Kingsbury Hale brought to these wilds a well-developed and well-stored mind. Although living to be an octogenarian, she still retained her excellent memory ; and to the delight of her grandchildren, the eUler chil- dren of her son Sullivan, she whiled away the long winter evenings, passed before the huge open fireplace, witii vivid accounts of battles of the Revolution, including that of Monmouth, in which her brother, Dr. Joseph Kingsbury, was wounded, and with thrilling stories of Indian captivities and other adventures in far-off colonial times. These stories she told as she had heard them in her girlhood from the lips of Ephraim Kingsbury, of Haverhill—" Uncle Ephraim," she used to call him— stories partly

of his own experience and partly, perhaps, relat- ing to the Ephraim Kingsbury who is on record in Chase's History of Haverhill, Mass., as hav- ing been killed by Indians in 1676.

Sullivan and Betsey (Staples) Hale were the parents of five children, namely: Eugene, I'nited States Senator; Hortense, who with her husband. Dr. Gushing, a retired physician, now lives on the old homestead in Turner, Me.; Frederick (deceased); Augusta (Mrs. Clifford); and Clarence, of Portland, Me., Judge of the United States Court.

Augusta Hale was fitted for college in the high school of Turner, in the companionship of a beloved brother, Frederick, with whom she shared every sport, overcame every diffi- culty, antl was permitted to accomplish every task. They even studied their lessons from the same book, going to ami from school together. His death in 1868 was her first affliction, and it marked the beginning of her literary aspira- tion. In 1859, at the age of seventeen, she entered Oberlin, then almost the only fully e(iuip])ed college (with a complete classical curriculum) in the country open to both sexes. Her voice was often heard in the college and the college society parts, delivered in the large clun-ch then, as now, connecteil therewith. But her stutlent life at Oberlin was only the beginning of the self-culture which must nec- essarily supjjlement the early education of men and women who accomplish anything worth while for the world.

After graduation she settled in Portland, and in 1869 was married to the Hon. George Gifford, originally a lawyer, afterward a jour- nalist, and finally for n^any years as at present in the consular service. Mrs. Gifford shared with her husband different fields «f foreign labor, and this resilience abroad has continued for her somewhat intermittently for more than a quar- ter of a century, their home being at intervals in London, Paris, various parts of France, and for several years in Basle, Switzerland. She became the mother of three children— Kath- erine, Clarence Hale, and Marguerite. The younger daughter was born during a long resi- lience of the family in Nantes, France. Many interesting and anuising incidents occurred in Mrs. Clifford's eariy trips across the Atlantic
