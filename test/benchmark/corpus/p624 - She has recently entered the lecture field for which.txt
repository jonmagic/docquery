MARY F. EASTMAN was born in Lowell, Mass. She was the third chikl of Gardner K. and Mary F. Eastman. Two brothers had died in childhood. A sister, Helen Eastman, who was two years younger than herself, and who was her lifelong companion, flied in 1902.

The Eastman and Flanders families, from which Miss Eastman sprang, were both of English origin. Their early representatives in this country were among the sturdy pioneers who settled at Salisbury, Mass., about 1640. The earliest ancestor in America, on one side, was Rodger Eastman; on the other, Stephen Flanders.

As noted by the author of "Tlie History and Genealogy of the Eastman Family in America," Mr. Guy S. Rix, of Concord, N.H., "Rodger Eastman and the other first .'ettlers in Salis- bury and adjoining towns were Puritans; and undei- the tyranny of the Tudors and Stuarts many left th(&gt;ir native country to enjoy civil and religious liberty."

The inunediate ancestor of Rodger East- man was John Eastman, of Romsey, County Southampton, England, who.se will was proved in 1602. A noteworthy fact in the other- wise conservative will of three hundred years ago is that his wife Anne is appointed by him residuary legatee and executrix. Consider- ing the very limited amount of education available to women in those days, especially in matters of business, the trust woulil seem to mark her as a woman of superior education as well as of practical ability.

While the descendants of Rodger Eastman and his associates were becoming "townsmen," "commoners," "freemen," and legislators —

sturdy workers and men of affairs as well — at intervals the lurid light of conflict illumined thei? sky. By a wily foe their houses were set in flames, women carried into captivity, and families scattered.

When a son of Rodger Eastman dieil, in administration of his estate " his brother was appointed guardian of his only son and of his mother Deborah, who was then in captivity to the Indians." Yet a valorous spirit pos- ses.sed them, and the settlement began to ex- tend into Connecticut, along the sea-coast, and, in the third generation, up the Merri- mac valley.
