Association, which has brought the school into affiliation with the great Christian student movement among the colleges, was due entirely to her influence, and she has continued quietly active in its behalf. Her general culture, her wide experience, her intuitive symjiathy, and her rich endowment of idealism have admirably fitted her to be the friend and coun- sellor of young women, and no girl has ever appealed to her in vain for advice, or comfort, or "mothering." The young in heart are always beloved, and this tribute of love has followed her wherever she has gone. The fragrance of such a life as hers is like that of the alabaster box of precious ointment — which has ever been the symbol of unselfish service and devotion.

MARY STONE BURNHAM.— It has been well said : " It is as difficult to write a faithful biography as to paint a true portrait. The artist gives form, line, color, and a phase of life and ex- pression. The biographer gives country, line- age, personal appearance, deeds; but the better part of life, the incentive, is as hard to catch, as delicate to transcribe, as the soul is to im- prison on canvas." The incentive in the life of Mrs. Burnham, it may well be said, is a deep- rooted generosity, which has prompted her to carry out the principle she has adopted, "Let me share my portion with others."

Mary Stone Burnham (born Stone) is a native of Maine. Her earlj^ years were passed at the home of her parents in South Paris, that State. She was educated for a teacher at the Farmington State Normal School, and before her marriage to Josiah Burnham, of Portland, was successfully engaged in the duties of her ])rofession. Interest in school work and ability to discover the best methods of meeting the needs of pupils caused her to be a tower of strength when the work of schoolroom decora- tion was begun in Porthmd.

Early in January, 1897, an informal tea was given by Mrs. George C. Frye to the commit- tee on this work, club presidents, and associate members, at which time suggestions as to ways

and means were presentetl. A fortnight later an appeal was made to the citizens of Port- land through the colunms of her papers to assist in this good work. The co-operation of the school board was secured, and a committee of nine, chosen from the Woman's Literary Union, with Mrs. Burnham as its chairman, began work.

So great was their energy that in May of the same year Reception Hall, City Building, was thrown open to the public for the inspection of the pictures and casts, more than seventy in number, which were to be presented to the public schools. At these presentation exer- cises Superintendent Lord presided, the Hon. J. W. Symonds delivered an admirable address, and Mrs. Burnham gave an accurate and in- teresting history of the work dolie by the com- mittee. She said: "Our aim has not been the purchase of pictures just because they are pict- ures, but pictures with a purpose and of ac- knowledged merit. All pictures are not suit- able. The fact of its being a masterpiece does not make it appropriate for the school-room. A Madonna teaches a higher ideal of woman- hood than a Bacchante, though both may be on the same artistic plane."
