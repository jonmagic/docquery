Allured by this untried path, she soon se- cured the hearty support and co-operation of many of the most prominent Boston physi- cians of the day. Not only did they semi their patients to her, but their wives and children also joined her classes. The enterprise, begun quietly in 1878 in a meagrely equipped room in E.ssex Street, under the name of "The Ladies' Gymnasium," was popular from the start.

At the end of the first year Miss Allen real- ized that her pupils who returnerl to her must have more advanced work. Then began her scheme for progressive physical development, which she has been greatly interested in per- fecting, as the years have gone on.

She was the first to introduce the sensible gynmastic costume (consisting of blouse and Turkish trousers, with no skirt), allowing per- fect freedom of motion, which is now adopted, in similar form, in all gynmasiums. A promi- nent Boston physician, on visiting her classes, remarked that it would be worth while for the women simply to put on this healthful dress and play about in the gymnasium a while, even if they did not ]ierform any of the exer- cises. It is probable that the physical train- ing for women, of which Miss Allen was the pioneer, has been one of the potent factors in diminishing the evils of tight lacing, which in

those days was much more the rule than at present.

Growing interest and enthusiasm for the work of the gymnasium necessitated a change at the end of the second year to more com- modious quarters in Amory Hall, on the corner of Washington and West Streets. The pro- spective need of teachers in this fiell led to the intioduction of a normal cdurse for their education, which has remained a permanent department of tlie gymnasium. Constantly increasing numbers, and an interest that con- tinued to grow, finally culminated in a demand for a larger hall and better eriuipment. A stock company was formed, which within two months raised the sum of fifty thousand dol- lars, and during the summer of 1SS6 a build- ing was constructed on St. Botolph and Gar- rison Streets, known thereafter as the Allen Gymnasium. This contained one of the larg- est and best equipped gymnasiums in the coun- try, with a large nuMiber of private ilressing- rooms, lavatories, and lockers, and in the base- ment six fine bowling alleys.

During the next few years the numbers greatly increased, and hundreds of pupils at- tended yearly, so that in 1891 still larger ac- commodations seemed necessary, especially a properly constructed room for the deep- breathing exercises, which have always formed an essential part of the plan of work. An annex was accordingly built, with a room arranged for respiratory M'ork, with special mechanical means for insuring pure air, over another gymnasium hall, while below were exquisitely finished Turkish and Russian baths, and a beautiful swimming-pool. The two buildings occupied a lot one hundred and fifty feet by ninety feet, and the city of Boston may well have been proud of possessing an institution which, devoted as it was to the in- terests of women and children exclusively, was unique in the annals of the country.
