When the beautiful stars peep out one by one,

.\s I look far up and away, How sweet to be able to whisper to God,

"I've made some one happy to-day!"

Her work for the Subiirban has brought this writer into considerable local prominence, the series of illustrated articles on "The Pipe Organ in Suburban Homes" having attractetl much favorable notice.

The Suhitrhan has used a considerable amount of their work in this line. In fact, for the Suburban Mrs. Perkins is at present doing niiicli of her literary work. Besides the illus- trated work her stories and songs appear from lime to time in that periodical.

supervisor of music in Wakefield and Beverly schools, uses verse written by Mrs. Perkins for his songs for different grades, requesting it as neeiled.

As a member of the Congregational Church of Lynnfield Centre, Mrs. Perkins finds oppor- tunity for religious work, having a class of young ladies in the Bible school and serving as clerk of the church, besides assisting in the music on Sundays.
