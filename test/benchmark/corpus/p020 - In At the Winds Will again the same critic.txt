In "At the Wind's Will" again the same critic recognized the strong style of the six- teenth century, noble and daring rhythms, the "(luintessence of passion," successes gained by the "courage of simplicity," rare specimens of

compression as well as of sweetness. "The Gentle Ghost of Joy" he thought "a wonderful voluntary in the best style of Chopin." In a line of one of the sonnets, "Yet done with striving and foreclosed of care," he finds some- thing as good as anything of Drayton's. He pronounced the two sonnets called "Great Love" worthy of a "place among Dante's and Petrarch's sonnets," antl of the sonnet, "Were but my Spirit loosed upon the Air," he wrote, "It is one of the greatest and finest sonnets in the English language."

I think every one who knows and loves poetry in its highest form and expression will agree with all this, and will feel that the critic spoke of very great verse. Many other critics have been to the full as appreciative, and have felt, as I do, the constant delight of splenditl phrase and Shakespearian vigor ami utterance in Louise Chandler Moulton's sonnets, anil the atmosphere of warmth and beauty that bathes the thought and fancy of each page.

But in spite of the largeness and high quality of her work it is quite as much the woman as the poet who is to be loved and admired. Large-hearted and large-souled, of a religious spirit unfettered by dogma, most tender, most true, most compassionate, genial, ingenuous, of an absolute integrity antl an absolute un- worldliness, she has the warm affection of all who are fortunate enough to know her at all clo,sely. Men and women, young and old, come to her for the pleasure of the passing hour, for advice, for sympathy in joy or trouble. From all over the country people write to her, con- fiding their perplexities and sorrows, craving intellectual or spiritual comfort, and always receiving it. Her wortls of cheer are given from the heart, and she has the satisfaction of knowing the support and strength some of her written words have been to those like the young girl who, confined to her bed for three years and too weak to listen to prayers, could be helped by murmuring to herself: â€”

" We lay us down to sleep. And leave to God the rest, Whether to wake and weep Or wake no more be best."'

Mrs. Moulton's home in Boston is full of in-

teresting souvenirs, autographs, signed pictures, and sculptures given Ijy the artists. At every turn there is association with famous or cher- ished names, and here her guests find their welcome generous and delightful, her manner gracious, her directness reassuring, her conver- sation full of sparkle, and her presence full of charm. In her youth of a remarkable beauty, a wild-rose bloom, biack-lashed and black- browed hazel eyes, bright hair, fine features, and the oval lines of the antique in the outline of cheek and chin, much of that charm of her youth she still retains, the same soft yet fear- less glance, the same heart-warming smile, the same grace of manner, always the same grace of nature, the same confident assurance of the goodness of every one in the world, loving God in humanity, and spending herself for others.
