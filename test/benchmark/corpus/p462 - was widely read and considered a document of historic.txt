It was dated " He;i(l&lt;(uarters Woman's Re- lief Corps, Auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic, Boston, July 23, 1885," and was in part as follows: —

"On this bright suamier morning the bells are tolling the reciuiem of our country's noble dead.

" Ex-President Ulyi^ses S. Cirant has closetl his eyes and laid him ilown to rest. The long, weary months of pairi and suffering are over, and our brave, lion-liearted Commander and comrade is no more. . . .

"As an auxiliary to the Grand Army of the Republic, who to-day mourn the loss of their conn-ade, it is fitting Jiat we, the members of the Woman's Relief ('orps, should unite with them in our expre.ssio is of sorrow and mourn- ing.

"Therefore, in recognition of the faithful ser- vices of this patriot, sildier, and friend, and as a tribute of our respectt and love for the 'Hero of A]ipomattox' and (:ur grateful rememl)rance of his licroic deeds, the charters of all corps throughout our order will be draped in emblems of mourning for sixty days, and at the first regular meeting after the receipt of this order all corjis shall set apart one hour for special services commemorati-^e of his life and glorious deeds as a soldier. . .

Army Nurses, she was called to \Vashington in June, 1889. She conferred with committees and Congressmen, rendering valualjle aid in support of favorable legislation for the pending bill. She was prostrated by the intense heat from which the city of Washington suffered during that summer. A severe illness followed, resulting in serious deafness, and she was obliged to defer active work for two years.

She was elected Department Treasurer in February, 1892, and has Ijeen unanimously re- elected at every subsequent State convention. She can rightfully claim the honor of being the pioneer of the Woman's Relief Corps. The organization, which now numbers one hundred and fift}' thousand members, is largely intlebted to her for the written work which was the foun- dation of its ritualistic system. Of her it may be said, as of Alexander Hamilton, that valu- able facts are stored away in the deep recesses of her mind, to rest untlisturbed until needed for reference. She is recognized authority on historical matters. She has delivered Memo- rial Day addresses in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, and has addressed hun- dreds of camp-fires and other patriotic gather- ings. She has friends in every State in the Union.
