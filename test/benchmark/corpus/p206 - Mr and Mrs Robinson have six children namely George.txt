ELLEN MARIA FOGG was born in Salem, Mass., in 1828, diuighter of Stephen and Lucinda (Goldthwait) Fogg. From the age of four 3'ears to that of thirteen the sul:iject of this sketch was a pupil at a young ladies' school.

some members of the class to calculate an eclipse, and two of the pupils agreed to calcu- late an eclipse of the moon, she undertook the more difficult task of calculating the next total eclipse of the sun, her calculation proving cor- rect to a minute.

In after years, as Genei'al Oliver livetl near her, Miss Fogg usetl frequently to call on him. Upon one such occasion, as they were talking of old school ilays, he spoke of the calculation of the eclipse, and asked her whether she still htid the paper on which she had worked it out, and what she was going to do with it. She replied that it was rolled up in a box, and she was not going to do anything with it. "Will you give it to me?" he asked.

This journey was a new and delightful experi- ence. When they arriveil in Russia, they took a carriage to the best Russian hotel.

They were taken directly to his office, and received a cordial welcome. Through his kindly offices their way was smoothed, they found comfortable acconnnoda- tions and ready service, and, when they re- sumed their travels, a courier was provided anil their journey facilitatcil in every possible way. After leaving Russia, Miss Fogg proposed to her friend that they should extend their travels
