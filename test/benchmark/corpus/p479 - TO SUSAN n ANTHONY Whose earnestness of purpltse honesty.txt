TO SUSAN n. ANTHONY

Whose earnestness of purp&lt;)se, honesty of intention, unremittin;^ industry, indefatigable perseverance, and extraordinary business talent are .surpassed only by the virtues of her life, devoted, like that of Dorothea Dix, to the cause of humanity.

In the winter of 1861 a number of aboli- tionists under the leadership of Susan B. An- thony planned a series of meetings to be held in the State of New York. In the small towns the meetings passed off quietly; but in every city, from Buffalo, where the first one was held on January 3, to Albany, they were broken up by mobs. At Albany the Democratic mayor, George H. Thacher, true to his oath to support the Constitution of the United States and the State of New York, aimounced to their op})o- nents his intention of protecting them in the right of speech. On the day apjwinted Asso- ciation Hall was filled to the doors. "The mayor went on the i)latform, ami announced that he had placed policemen in citizens' clothes in various parts of the hall, and that whoever made the least disturbance would be at once arrested. Then he laid a revolver across his knees, and sat during the morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. Several times the mob broke forth, and each time arrests were promptly made. Toward the close of the evening he said to Mi.ss Anthony, 'If you insist upon holding your meetings to- morrow, I shall still protect you; but, if you will adjourn at the clo.se of this session, I shall consiiler it a personal favor.' Of course, she willingly acceded to his request." This closed the series of conventions. Inmiediately after- ward the State Woman's Rights Convention

was held in Albany, February 7 and S, and this was the last of those conventions for five years.

In the summer of 1862 Miss Anthony attended her last State Teachers' Convention, which was held in Rochester. For ten years she had kept up her membership dues, and had not missed an annual meeting; ami since 1.S.53, when she first made her voice heard in the tlelibera- tions, she had advocated the rights of women teachers to hold office in the organization, to serve on committees, to exercise free speech, and to receive ecjual pay with men for ecjual work.

In the fall she entered the lecture field, speaking extempore on "Emancipation the Duty of the Government." A prominent citizen, after hearing her at Mecklenburg, wrote to her, "There is not a man among all the political speakers who can make that &lt;luty as plain as you have done."

In New York City, at an enthusiastic meet- ing held in Dr. Cheever's church on May 14, 1863, in a dark period of the Civil War, when speeches were made by Angelina Grimke W^eld, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and others, was formed the Woman's National Loyal League, to give suj)- port to the government in its war for freedom. Mrs. Stanton was elected president. Miss An- thony secretary of the organization. Its ftbject was to secure jjetitions to the Senate and House of Representatives, praying for an act emanci- pating all persons of African descent held in involuntary servitude. To this work Miss An- thony devoted her energies for a year and a half, sending out from the headciuarters of the league. Room '20, Cooper Institute, where she remained all through the hot sununer, thou- sands of blank petitions, accomj)anied by a circular letter asking for .'signers to the peti- tions. Charles Sunmer distriliuted these peti- tions under his frank; and on February 9, 1S64, he presented to the Senate the first instalment of the filled-out petitions, saying: "These peti- tions are signed by one hundred thousand men and women. They are from all parts of the country and from every condition of life. They ask nothing less than universal emancipation, and this they a.sk directly from the hands of Congress." In August, 1864, the nutnber of
