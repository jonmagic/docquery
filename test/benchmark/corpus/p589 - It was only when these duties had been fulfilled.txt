It was only when these duties had been fulfilled that Miss Perkins permitted her taste for literary work to a.ssert itself once more. She accepted a position on the editorial staff of the Morning Star — the official organ of the Free Baptist denomination, published in Boston — maintaining her connection with this periodical for seven years. She was then transferred to the more difficult position of editor of the three juvenile papers of the denomination — Our Diiyxpring, for young peo- ple; The Myrtle, for children; and Our Myrtle Buds, for the little tots. The first antl last were originated by her, and all three were under her sole management, their success fully attesting the tact and versatility, little short of genius, that are absolutely necessary to an editor of children's papers.

These periodicals were, in truth, the heralds of the great movement among young people that was soon to sweep with such beneficent results over the church life of all denomiiuitions; and Miss Perkins was speedily called upon to assume the great but inspiring responsibilities

of a pioneer in this world-wide movement by organizing and directing the young people's work of her denomination, the first young people's society of any denomination being organized in a Free Baptist church.

The six years that followed proved that she had inherited her father's capacity to serve a great cause with boundless energy and enthusiasm. Into this brief period was crowded a phenomenal amount of labor; for to the duties of editorshiji there was added the exacting work of a general secretary, which included travelling, arranging for and addressing conventions, organizing new so- cieties, and carrying on a vast amount of correspondence. It was in the days before the word "strenuous" hatl attained to its present hard-worketl prominence, but her life at this time amply merited the term. It was also somewhat unusual for a woman to wield great influence from the platform, but as a speaker Miss Perkins possessed the rare combination of magnetism, grace, and sym- pathy that were their own best justification.

She was greatly beloved and loyally fol- loweil by the host of young people whom she had organized into a splendid working force, but the long-continued strain of the combined duties of secretary and .editor finally made a vacation of at least a year imperative. Before the year was over, however, she re- ceived an unexpected and flattering invitation to become preceptress of the New Englanil Conservatory of Music, located in Boston. This position she retained for six years, until the removal of the Conservatory, in 1902, to its present building on Huntington Avenue of the same city. A change in the school management altered her ilutics somewhat, but she is still connected with the Conserv- atory (1904), and retains her official title. During the year 1903 she again evinced her versatility by making a systematic catalogue of the rare musical scores and other valuable volumes of the Conservatory Library.

Her work at the Conservatory, although directed in a somewhat different channel, has been logically a continuation of her life of service for young people. The organization of the Conservatory Young Women's Christian
