also serving for some time as chairman of its Miscellaneous Conuuittee. After a few years of married life it became nece.ssary for her to support herself, an entirely new experience. This led her to resume her maiden name, by which she has ever since been known. In 1S96 Mrs. Drake came East to join the army of self-supporting and self-respecting women. She was eciuipped for the battle with courage, a firm will, and both natural and acciuired ability. Numbering among her personal friends, besides Lucinda H. Stone, above mentioned (now de- ceased), such women as Frances Willard, Mary A. Livermore, the Rev. Anna Shaw, the Rev. Caroline Bartiett Crane, and Alice Ives Breed, she dill not lack sagacious counsel and kindly intercession.

After working for some months for various publishing houses, she became connected with tiie Boston agency of the Mutual Life Insur- ance Company of New York, and in 1900 suc- ceeded Mrs. M. A. F. Potts as manager of its women's department, the first to be organized in connection with any life insurance company in Boston. Under her management this depai't- ment has grown to be a factor in life insurance recognized by the different companies as well as by the insuring public at large. In training women for the profession of life insurance, to tlo the work intelligently and conscientiously, and thus with a success gratifying to all concerned, Mrs. Drake has shown herself an adept. As shown from the unanimous testimony of her associates, she possesses in a marked degree tact, dignity of character, a keen sense of honor, and exceptional (jualifications for direct- ing the work of others, being one of the few to whom authority means nothing more or less than the courteous and appreciative recognition of the rights and interests of those who act under her instructions.

Mrs. Drake is a member of the Ciiurch of the Disciples, and has been a worker along charitable lines. She belongs to the Massa- chusetts Woman Suffrage Association, and. she retains her membership in the above men- tioned Ladies' Library Society and also in the Twentieth Century Club of Kalamazoo, of which .she was one of the founders.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Charles Felton Pklgin, author of "Blenncr- hassett," for the purpose of historical research, she is an active member, holding the office of vice-councillor. Her interest in the work of the legion is thus explained: â€”

As is well known, Aaron Burr, thiril Vice- President of the United States, was a grandson of Jonathan Edwards, theologian, Presitlent of Princeton College. His mother was Estlicr Edwards, daughter of the Rev. Jonathan and wife of the Rev. Aaron Burr, Sr. Her son, Aaron Burr, was cousin to Edward" Edwards; and Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia Bun- Alston, and Mary Edwards McKinney, Mrs. Drake's grandmother, were second cousins.

From her girlhood the story of Theodosia Burr, with its mysterious tragical ending, has had for Mrs. Drake a strong fascination. The brief verdict, "Lost at sea," was supjile- mented in 1850, some years before the birth of Stella Drake, by the confession of an aged pauper in the Cassopolis (Mich.) poorhouse, that he had been one of the pirates by whom the "Patriot," the vessel in which Mrs. Alston had taken passage at Charleston, S.C., on De- cember 30, 1812, for New York, had been capt- ured, and that he himself had been set to tip the plank on which she walked to her death off the stormy shore of Cape Hatteras. He remembered her for her marvellous beauty and her unshrinking fortitude.
