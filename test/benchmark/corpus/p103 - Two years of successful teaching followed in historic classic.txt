Two years of successful teaching followed in historic, classic Concord, and then, to the great regret of the Concord School Board, she accepted an appointment to teach in her home city, where later she became the honored and beloved principal of one of its largest primary schools, and developed remarkable tact in controlling and interesting the children under her care.

It was in the Sunday-school connected with the- Lynn Common Methodist Episcopal Church that she had begun her work as a teacher at the age of fifteen, at the age of sixteen being elected superintendent of its Primary Depart- ment. She resigned this position when in Concord, but after she returned to Lynn was

annually re-elected until her resignation at the close of 1900. She reorganizetl this de- partment into Kindergarten, Primary, and Junior Departments, and supervised the teach- ing of the two hundred and forty-five jjupils.

Richly endowed with strong intellectual powers, possessed of ileep religious experience and remarkable teaching abilities, while thus earnestly devoting herself to her 'duties in Sunday-school and day school she was, un- consciously, fitting herself for a wider field of usefulness. In 1892 she received a call which appealed to her as a divine vocation, not to be resisted. She accordingly resigned her posi- tion as principal of the Lynn Primary School, and under the direction of Mr. William N. Hartshorn, of Boston, recently elected chair- man of the International Executive Commit- tee of Sunday-school Work, became the Pri- mary Secretary of the Massachusetts Inter- denominational Sunday-school Association, being the first woman in the L'nited States elected as an acting State Primary Secretary.

In this office Miss Vella displayed good abil- ities as a public speaker, clearness antl help- fulness as a writer, antl genius as an organizer. In her public addresses she aroused, capti- vated, and held her audiences, often stirring them to profound gratitude toward Gotl for his love, antl sincere determinations to utilize to the best of their abilities their opportuni- ties to teach his truths to their children. Her influence over children she taught seemed irre- sistible. The irrepressible were checked, the listless aroused, all became absorbed in her words and spiritual pictures. She made the Bible ta the little ones a perfect delight; to their seniors, a new revelation from God; to all, the love of Christ a living reality and the desire to serve him controlling.

She was a potent factor in organizing the evangelical Sunday-schools of Massachusetts into district associations that hold annual con- ventions and other gatherings, unifying, har- monizing, and intensifying all the vital inter- ests of the Sunday-schools of Massachusetts. She also organized and supervised the work of thirty-five primary teachers' unions, taught weekly the Boston Primary Union, and super- intended her own primary Sunday-school in

In addition to her work in Massachusetts, she gave great impetus to the Sunday-school cause by her addresses at annual State con- ventions in all the New England States, at primary teachers' institutes in the New Eng- land and Central States, at the annual Pro- vincial conventions of Montreal, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and the Inter- national Conventions held at St. Louis in 1893, at Boston in 1896, at Atlanta in 1899, and at the AVorld's Convention held at London, Eng- land, in 1898. At St. Louis in 1893 Mrs. Borden was elected Secretary of the International Primary Department, but refused to accept re-election at Boston in 1896, because of greatly increased calls for addresses and correspond- ence in the State work. She was elected Vice- President of the International Primary De- partment, and re-elected in 1899. Meanwhile she kept busy a ready pen, being a frequent and highly valued correspondent of the 821.11- day-school Times, the International Evangel, the Su7iday-school Journal, and other periodi- cals. She is also the author of several popular Sunday-school concert exercises and of two books, "Song and Study for God's Little Ones" and "Bible Study Songs." These books are a veritable storehou.se of good things, from which primary teachers, leaders of mission bands and of other children's gatherings, may obtain helpful Bible exercises and suitable songs.
