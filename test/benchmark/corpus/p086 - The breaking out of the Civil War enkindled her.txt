The breaking out of the Civil War enkindled her patriotism, and it was through conversa- tion with Dr. Leonard that she was led to form the purpose of becoming an army nurse. Her application to be allowed to .serve in this capac- ity did not at once meet a favorable response, Miss Dorothea L. Dix, superintendent of army nurses, considering her too young to go to the front. She waited for a time, and directly after the evacuation of Yorktown Mr. Fay was prominently connected with the Sanitary Commission; and, realizing that she would be a valuai:)le assistant in tliat .service, he secured her a position on one of the hospital boats. She went from his house in Chelsea to the war, and was with Mr. Fay at all the principal battles. For several months her duties were confined to these boats, stationed at ilifferent points.

On September 18, 1862, a few hours after the battle of Antietam, she reached the field, re- maining on duty tiiere and at Pleasant Valley until the wounded had been taken to the gen- eral hospitals. November and December of the same year found her at work in the camps and hospitals near Fredericksburg, Va., during the campaign of General Burnsitle., In the .spring of 1863 she was there again, being also at the battle of Chancellorsville and in the Potomac Creek hospital.

finding that her special diet supplies had been lost on the passage, she returned to Washing- ton, and went to Gettysburg, arriving a few hours after the last day's tiglit. She worked here until the wounded had all been sent to Base Hospital. In October, November, and December, 1863, she worked in the hospitals on Folly and Morris Islands, South Carolina, when General Gilmore was besieging Fort Sumter. Early in 1864 she joined the army at Brandy Station, and in May went with the Auxiliary Corps of the Sanitary Connnission to Fredericksburg, when the battle of the Wilderness was being fought."

She served in the tent, on the field, or in the hospitals at Antietani, Fredericksburg, Chan- cellorsville, and Gettysburg. In the terrible campaigns of the Wilderness and in all the other engagements of the Army of the Potomac in 1864 antl 1865 she labored unceasingly. She was often under fire and suffered many hardships, but with unselfish devotion, her only thought being that of duty.

William Howell Reed, in his book upon "Hospital Life in the Army of the Potomac," has much to say of Miss Gilson and her work, his first reminiscence being connected with Fredericksburg: "One afternoon just before the evacuation, when the atmosphere of our rooms was close and foul, and all were longing for a breath of cooler Northern air, while the men were moaniiig with pain or restless with fever, and our hearts were sick with pity for the sufferers, I heard a light step upon the stairs; and, looking up, I saw a young lady enter who brought with her such an atmosphere of calm and cheerful courage, so much fresh- ness, such an expression of gentle, womanly sympathy, that her mere presence seemeil to revive the drooping spirits of the men and to give them new power of endurance through their long hours of suffering. First with one, then at the sitle of another, a friendly word here, a gentle word and smile there, a tender sympathy with each prostrate sufferer, a sym- pathy which could read in his eyes his longing for home love and for the presence of some absent one, in those few moments hers was in- deed an angel ministry. Before she left the room she sang to them, first some stirring
