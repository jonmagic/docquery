of this name, also from Governor Endicott, from the Rev. Samuel Skelton, and other early colonists.

Seven of Miss Faxon's ancestors served in the Revolutionary War, among them being Captain Etlmund^ Ptitnam (father of Israel" above named), who connnanded one of the companies of militia that marched from Dan- vers in response to the Lexington alarm of April 19, 1775.

George" Faxon dying when his daughter Grace was ten years of age, she went with her widowed mother antl family to reside with her maternal grandparents in Danvers, Mass. Her schcjol life was but little prolonged be- yond the early years of her girlhood. Miss Faxon has, however, been a wide reader and diligent home student. Prompted by a fond- ness for the Bessie books, when only seven she wrote a series of stories; at eight she had read all of Dickens; and at sixteen she was teaching a tlistrict school in which many of the pupils were okler than she. She continued teaching for four years, having charge of schools successively in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. Possessed of a strong tlramatic temperament, she early became interested in the stage as a profession, and even while engaged in school- teachmg she studied under Rachel Noah and other leading teachers of dramatic art in Boston.

On account of family opposition she finally relinquished the idea of going on the stage, but frequently appeared in lectures and readings.

At the age of twenty she turned her atten- tion to writing for publication. Her first ventures in this field took the form of short stories for children and ailults. Afterward she wrote for teachers' magazines, and in less time than a year was called to New York City to join the editorial staff of the New York School Journal, for which she contributed freely to every issue, writing on school-room sub- jects and arranging many original school-room entertainments. She resigned that [josition to become editor-in-chief of Wer7ier's Maga- zine. This monthly, devoted to the stage and
