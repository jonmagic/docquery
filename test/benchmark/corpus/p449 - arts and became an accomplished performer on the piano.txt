General Henry B. Carrington, of Hyde Park, Mass., who was intimately acquainted witli Mrs. Sibylla Crane as the wife and afterward the widow of his beloveil classmate, the Rev. Oliver Crane, D.D., pays the following tribute to her memory: â€”

"I did not know her personally until shortly before their marriage, in the consvunmation of whicli my wife and myself greatly rejoiceil. His literary and poetical tastes found in her congenial attributes the complement to his most ardent wi.shes. Living so near my home, they were like brother and sister to me. In his last illness the intimacy became more con- stant, until, as his last request, I })romi.scd to give to her the affection and care of a ti'ue brother as long as she should survive his de- parture. And then, in the examination of the literary and cla.ss material left by him, I shared with her the care and disposition of the same. . . . Tho.se years of intimate acquaint- ance, thus ripened into years of a practical brotherhootl, were gilded with ever-growing appreciation of her noble qualities as wife, daughter, and friend. Her dignity antl grace as a woman and her refinement in tastes were marked characteristics that any stranger would honor. Her tender sympathies and liberal charities abounded wlierever invoked by the sick or the needy, and the serenity and poLse of her character harmonized with attributes which distinguished her from almost any other of her sex."
