Mrs. Cheney was one of the subscribers toward the establishment in 1856, under the leadenship of Dr. Zakrzewska, of the first women's hospital, the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. A few years later she was interested with others in the ad- dition of a clinical department to the medical school for women in Boston, now merged in Boston University. In 1863 she was one of the three women corporators of the New England Hospital, which they had started in 1862 in a house on Pleasant Street. "Ac- cepting the position of secretary, Mrs. Cheney," to quote the words of Dr. Zakrzewska, "devoted herself to the work, and became one of the most powerful advocates and supporters of this in- stitution — an institution now firmly established and professionally recognized, and which by its' efficiency and conscientious work has not only educated women as physicians and nurses, but has opened the way for the former to a professional equality with medical men, as the Ma.ssachusetts Medical Society was tlie first to adnnt women as members."

Succeeding Mi.ss Lucy Goddard as president of the hospital in 1887, Mrs. Cheney continued in office, discharging the duties thereof with

zeal and efficiency for fifteen years, or until her resignation on account of failing health in Oc- tober, 1902. She is now Honorary President.

Early interested in the work of the Freed- man's Aid Society, and becoming the secretary of the teachers' committee on the resignation of Miss Stevenson, Mrs. Cheney made several visits to the South in the years directly follow- ing the close of the war for the Union, the first time going with Abby M. May as a delegate to a convention in Baltimore. Unexpectedly called upon there to address a meeting com- posed largely of colored people, she had her first experience in public speaking. During her absence on one of these Southern trips a society was formed in Boston, of which she was appointed a director, being now Honorary President, and in which she has continued to work — the Free Religious Association, "the freedom and inspiration of whose first meet- ings" she finds it "impossible to report."

In 1868 Mrs. Cheney was one of the founders of the New England Women's Club, which soon came to be recognized as a forceful influence for good in the community; and about the same time she identified herself with the woman suf- frage movement. For some years she was Vice- president of the Massachusetts School Suffrage Association. Joining the Association for the Advancement of W^omen early in the seven- ties, a year or two after its organization, she became one of its most valued workers and speakers. Mrs. Cheney also assisted in the founding of a horticultural school for women, of which Abby W. May became president. It was given up when Bussey College opened, and admitted women to its classes.

Mrs. Cheney's second visit to Europe in 1877, in company with her sisters and her daughter, was saddened in Rome by the death of her sister Helen. Returning to Boston in 1878, she respontled to an invitation to give a course of lectures on art at the Concoril School of Phi- losophy the following summer, and continued to lecture throughout the session.
