While living in Sioux City, it became neces- sary for her to assume the support of her three young children. Their education was the determined puri)ose of her life. Accordingly with fear and trembling, but without shrinking, she borrowed money and bought out a china antl silverware estal)lishment, antl carrietl on

a wholesale and retail business. Although she had no business education, had not even studied book-keeping, an&lt;l liitherto had been wholly unacquainted with business, she made a marked success of this enterprise, and continued in it until the necessity was passed.

Convinced of the need of organized effort, Mrs. Fessenden started the Young Women's Christian Association of Sioux City, whose work soon had a much wider scope than that of such organizations in larger cities. The Association rented an old building, where rooms were fitted up for the worthy {)oor. One room was con- verted into a chapel, and religious services were held there regularly the year round. A parlor organ, chandelier, and stove were given by this lover of humanity, and she held herself personally responsible for every service. During a season of great floods on the Mis.sissippi mid- night often found her still superintending the lighting and heating of the building and the feeding and putting to bed of tiie hundreds of homeless sufferei-s who sought temporaiy shelter. Her own house was stripped of chairs for women with young children, and she did her utmost, both as an individual and as Presi- dent of the Y. W^. C. A., the organization having assumed the care of these needy people.

Just before leaving Sioux City, Mrs. Fessenden selected the site and measured the lot on which was to be built a home for the organization which she had for eight years served so faith- fully as President. Here stands to-day the Samaritan Hospital, carried on by the Y. W\ C. A. for over twenty years. Although other hospitals have since been built in Sioux City, this, the first, still has the confidence and the support of the community. In 1903, when Mrs. Fes- senden revisited her old home, the trustees of the hospital gave her a fine reception in recog- nition of the fact that to her efforts they were indebted for the conception of the hosjjital.

In 1882 Mrs. Fessenden removed to Boston for the college education of her children. Her two daughters entered Boston University wilh the classes of 1886 and 1889, respectively, and later her son with the class of 1894.

After the graduation of her elder daughter Mrs. Fessenden took her family to I'An-ope, that Cornelia might prepare herself to take the d(&gt;gree

Ph.D. After six months of study and an illness of only three days this beautiful daughter was calletl to a higher sphere. This was a blow from which at first it seemed as if Mrs. Fessenden could not possil:)ly recover. Upon her return to America her friends |)revaile(l upon her to enter on work with the \\ Oman's Christian Tem- perance Union. First she was made National Superintendent of Franchise. In 1890 she was unanimously elected to the office of State Presi- dent of the W. C. T. U. of Massachusetts, ami continued in that oihce for eight years. In 1898 she resigned the presidency to' become National Lecturer.
