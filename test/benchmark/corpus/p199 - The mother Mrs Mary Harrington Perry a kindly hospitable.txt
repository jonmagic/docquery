The mother, Mrs. Mary Harrington Perry, a kindly, hospitable woman, with a charm of manner that attracted strangers to her, was a notable housekeeper, bringing up her chiUlren to habits of industry and thrift. In the sick- room she had rare tact and skill. Her simi:Â»le presence was a blessing.

Julia Maria (Mrs. Baker) was the fourth child of Deacon Sanmel Perry and his wife Maiy.

She acquired her educiition in the district school, three-quarters of a mile from her home, the Worcester High School, o])ened in 1846, Leices- ter Acatlemy, and Williraham Academy. For several years she was engaged in teaching, her first school, in a neighboring town, being an ungraded one of seventy-six pupils. She after- ward taught in interm*'diate and grammar schools. Ecjuipped with thorough knowledge of the branches to be taught and with a native force of character that showed itself in emer- gencies, she brought to her work an enthusi- asm that aroused and held the interest of her pupils, and ensured her success as teacher and di.sciplinarian.

On June 27, 1861, she married William James Baker, of Worcester, a son of James and Lydia (Gouldingj Baker. For many years Mr. Will- iam J. Baker was in active business as a mem- ber of the firm of Charles Baker &amp; Co., of Worces- ter, lumber manufacturers and dealers. Owing to failing health he retired from business cares about five years ago.

Mrs. Baker brought up from babyhood a niece of her husband's, a child whose father, a minister, had died. Later God bestowed upon her a baby boy who has since grown to a jjromising manhood, being of strong char- acter and good business ability.

Mrs. Baker is a member of Union Church, of the Congregational denonnnation, and has taken a jirominent part in church work. For eight years she was deaconess under the pastor- ates of Drs. Stlmson and Davis, and during that time she had charge of the women's prayer meeting, and also had the main care of si.xteen families. Her helpers were not suited to the woi'k, or were too busy or were too easily dis- couraged. She has since contimied it, having cared for .some of the families up to this day. Her reward has been in seeing them prosper, become members of the church and useful members of the community. Mrs. Baker keeps up her interest in some of those whom she has thus helped, and still corresponds with tho.se who have moved away from Worcester. She was formerly vice-president of a literary society in Wilbraham, most of the time acting, owing to the sickness of tht&gt; president. She possesses rare tact and skill in nursing, inherited from
