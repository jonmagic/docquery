ELIDA RUMSEY FOWLE. philanthropic worker, one of the founders, in 1863, of the Soldiers' Free Library and Read- ing Room in Washington, D.C., has been for the past fifteen years, with her hus- band, Mr. John A. Fowle, a resident of Dor- chester, Mass. She was born in New York City, June 0, 1842, daughter of John WicklifTo and Mary Agnes (Underbill) Rumsey.

In 1861 her parents removed to Washing- Ion. Her mother was constant in works of love among the soldiers of the Civil War, and Miss Ruinsey (now Mrs. Fowle) soon began visiting the hospitals with a desire to add .sunshine to the dreary days of the sick and wounded. Realizing that her musical talents could be of .'^eivice, she sang to them songs that were an inspiration. Men released from Libby Prison and located temporarily at the Soldiers' Rest she arou.?ed from a state of apathy and gloom to one of courage and ho]ie. Forming jjlans for improving the condition of the convalescents antl other soldiers stationed at Washington, she received the co-operation of Mr. John A. F'owle, who held a position in the Navy Department at Washington. They established a Sunday evening prayer meeting in Columbian College hospital, an upper room in "Auntie Pomoroy's" ward being assigned for the purpose. It was crowded every night, and overflow meetings were held in a grove near by. A report of these gatherings in " Our Army Nurses" says: "The interest steadily in- creased, the boys often doing double duty in order to be present. The enthusiasm of the soldiers could not be repressed when Miss Rum,sey's sweet voice stirred their souls and rekindled the noble, self-sacrificing spirit that had brought them to such a place; and cheers shook the very walls."
