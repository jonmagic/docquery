when she was the guest of Admiral Gherardi and the only passenger allowed by the Secre- tary of the Navy on board the flagship "Phil- adelphia."

Mrs. Gosse has travelled hundreds of miles in the service of the Herald, accompanying President Harrison, President Cleveland, and the late Secretary Blaine upon long journeys. Upon the occasion of the latter's resignation from the Harrison cabinet she went to Wash- ington, and, returning to Boston with Secre- tary and Mrs. Blaine, remained with them at the Brunswick for three days, while awaiting the returns from the Minneapolis convention, the only woman in a small army of represent- atives of all the prominent dailies in the coun- try. She was present when Mr. Blaine re- ceived and read the despatch announcing the nomination of Mr. Harrison and the death- blow of his own hopes. "I knew," she .said at the time, " that I was looking on while his- tory was being made." That night she ac- companied Mr. and Mrs. Blaine to Bar Harbor. A week later the death of Emmons Blaine, in Chicago, entailed uppn her another long journey.

Mrs. Gosse also achieved great success as a special correspondent, her work always being of intense interest. Her interviews with Cardi- nal Gibbons were copied into nearly every Catholic publication in the country. She in- terviewed Presidents Cleveland and Harri- son and many members of their Cabinets.

Especially notable service was rendered the Herald by Mrs. Gosse when she carried the news of the death of James Russell Lowell from Bar Harbor to President Eliot at his summer residence at Seal Harbor, and later that of George William Curtis. In each in- stance she rode twenty-two miles at midnight over the roads of Mount Desert, to telegraph his tributes to those great men to her paper. During one Presidential campaign she remained in Maine until after the State election, report- ing the speeches of many prominent political orators.

Mrs. Gosse was among the first to discern the importance and phenomenal development of the woman's club movement. She estab- lished the department "Among the W^omen's Clubs" in the Sunday Herald, which she still

conducts, and also that known as "Colonial and Patriotic," a record of the happenings among the hererlitary patriotic societies.

In addition to her work for the Herald, Mrs. Gosse has done much special work for the New York Mail and Express and the New York Herald, also for such publications as the North American Review, the New England Mag- azine, Harper's Bazar, Wide Awake, and I^ip- pincott's.

Mrs. Gosse has been prominently identified with the New England Woman's Press Asso- ciation from the beginning. For several years she was chairman of the programme commit- tee, preparing some of the most successful entertainments in the history of the club, and she was its president in 1898. L^pon retiring from the presidency she was made honorary vice-president for life.

She was founder and is vice-presiilent of the Boston W'oman's Press Club, has been four times elected president of the Boston Business League, and is also president for life of the Boston Floral Emblem Society. She has been much interested in reform work, being a promi- nent promoter of the movement to secure police matrons. She was also for a time press super- intendent of the W. C. T. U. Deeply inter- ested in music and a fine musician herself, she has been an active worker in the Easter Music and Flower Mission to Hospitals.
