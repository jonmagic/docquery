The company, much de- pleted, passetl by, bearing the tattered flag, which had been through many battles. The two children, one representing a soldier, the other the Goddess of Liberty, were stand- ing upon the porch of the old home- steatl. As the company reached the house, they halted, antl saluted the children; and Mrs. Hill, from behind the little ones, responded to the graceful tribute. The colonel before his death acknowledged his mistake, and apolo- gized for his rudeness at the time of the flag presentation.

In 18.S.S Mrs. Hill's residence was in Charles- town. For two years she had been president of the Ward and City Committee of Women Voters, and she was also president of the Bunker Hill Woman's Educational League, an organ- ization that was formed in February. Through the efTorts of this organization alone twenty- six hundred women were as.sessed, with a view to taking part in the school election; and a most vigorous campaign was carried on, women being stationed at the various registration places to watch proceedings. The result of the election was most gi-atifying. Not only was the whole school board ticket successful, but the women hatl much influence in bringing about a change at City Hall. The Independent Women Voters' party was the outgrowth of the struggle of 18S8, and until 1896 Mrs. Hill was the leader of this party. In 1889 the Woman's Voice and Public School Champion was first printed. Mrs. Hill became the editor and general manager, and still retains these offices.
