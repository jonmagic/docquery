MARTHA ELIZABETH FOSS MANN, M.D., a well-established medical practitioner in Boston, was born in this city, March 9, 1848, daughter of Charles Meade and Martha Eiiz- al:&gt;eth (Hatchman) Foss. Her father, who was for many years a prosperous jeweller in Boston, came of the old New Hampshire Foss family. Dr. Mann's great-gram If ather Foss was a Revolutionary soldier, enlisting at Rye, N.H., and serving under General Stark at the battle of Bennington. At the cIo.se of the war he took u|i laml in Meredith, N.H., where he subsecjueutly resided until his death. A maternal ancestor, John Hatchman, was also a Revolutionary soldier; and through these valiant and patriotic men Dr. Mann holds mem-

bership in the Daughters of the American Revo- lution, belonging to Boston Tea Party Chapter.

The subject of this sketch was educated in the public schools of Boston and at one of the leading private schools, where, after being graduated from the high school, she continued her studies for four years.

On February 22, 1871, she married Dr. Ben- jamin Houstcjn Mann, a graduate of the Har- vard Medical School and a soldier in the Twenty- fourth Massachusetts Infantry tluring the Civil War. Four children we're born of this marriage, all sons, namely: Benjamin Percy, November 9, 1871; Charles Foss, April 23, 1873, who died April 4, 1877; Houston, December 31, 1875; and Arthur Meade, February 5, 1879.

In 1881 Dr. Benjamin H. Mann died; and his widow, with her three children, returned to her father's home. Deciiling to adopt the medical profession, she enteretl Boston Uni- versity in 1882, received her degree in 1885, and immediately began practice in Boston. For seven years she was the assistant of the eminent Dr. Horace Packard in his private practice and hospital work. Dr. Mann has served for five years as secretary of the Boston Homoeopathic Medical Society, was vice-presi- dent of the Boston Gynaecological Society, was president of the Twentieth Century Medical Society, is a member of the American Institute of Homoeopathy and of the Massachusetts Homoeopathic Medical Society, and is instructor and lecturer at Boston University.

From her youth Dr. Mann has been a mem- ber of the Congregational church, but she at- taches more importance to daily works than to creed. Though possessing much natural apti- tude for her {)rofession, which was fostered by her association with her husband, her success has been due to concentration of purpose and unceasing labor rather than to any fortuitous circumstances.
