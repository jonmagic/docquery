to the nortli, and they therefore crossed over and visited Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. An account of their visit to St. Petersburg and Moscow was prepared by Miss Fogg in tlie form of two lectures, one on St. Petersburg and one on Moscow, which she has read in private parlors several times to large and appieciative audiences.

Miss Fogg has also visiteil Sorrento, Capri, and the Blue Grotto, and was the last, with one or two friends, to make a partial ascent of Mount ^'esuvius just before one of its notable eruptions. An account of these travels, written to a friend, was published, unknown to her, in a New York paper In June, 1883, she had the great pleasure of seeing the Passion Play per- formed at Brinlegg, in the Austrian Tyrol; and she wrote a full account of it, which was pub- lished in the Church Eclectic, covering ten pages.

Between her two visits to Europe, Miss Fogg spent several winters in New York, and while there translated for a clerical friend two French theological works, one of which was published. She eilited the Girls' Friendly Magazine as long as it was published in Boston. For sev- eral years she also reviewed new books for the Church Eclectic. When she came to Boston, after several winters spent in New York, slie was asked to take a class in church history, and consented reluctantly, being doubtful of her own ability; but, with careful study she carried on the class through the winters, giving thirteen lectures, one every Satunlay morning, an hour long, to a class of thirty young ladies.

Miss Fogg converses about her travels in an entertaining and instructive manner. Her de- scriptions of scenes bring them vividly before her hearers. She has some beautiful souve- nirs gathered from places of note. Her lecture on Russia, a country which so few visit in their trips abroad, written wholly from her own ex- perience, is especially interesting and instruc- tive; and, through the solicitation of students and artists who have travelled abroad, this, with her other lectures, will soon be pub- lished.

While in Rome Miss Fogg made a collection of pictures to illustrate her copy of Hawthorne's tald, "The Marble Faun; or, The Romance of Monte Beni," in England published under the

title "Transformation." The fifty-five pictures bound up in her book add very much to its in- terest and vahie.

A communicant of the Episcopal church, Miss Fogg is also a member of the Dorcas So- ciety of St. Stephen's, of tiie Educational and Industrial Union, the Girls' Frientlly Society, and an associate of St. Margaret's.
