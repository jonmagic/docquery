Pecuniary misfortunes reduced the family income by and by, and put to the test the character of the young girl who was just now beginning to realize the serious meaning of life. She had learned all that the best private school for girls in Worcester could teach her. Her parents coukl not afford to sentl her away to school, so at the age of fourteen she bor-

rowed money of an elder sister to pay her expenses for a year at the Friends' School in Providence, R.I. Though not (as she declared) a brilliant scholar, she was a most faithful student, often working so hard over her lessons that the perspiration would stand out on her face as if from hard physical exertion. She took a high rank in her class, and was there- fore able to obtain from her teachers a recom- mendation which secured her a school the next year, though she was only fifteen years old. Having paid her debt and earned a little beside, she returned to school; and for three years she alternately taught and studied, until she had finished the most advanced course of instruction which New England then offered to women. From the age of fourteen she paid all her own expenses.

She was fond of dress, and indulged to the full in the few frivolities -allowed by her sect, which did not altogether frown upon rich silks anil satins, if plainly fashioned and of subdued tints. Abby (I think she had already dropped the "gail") had an eminently social nature, and did not disdain the pomps and vanities of parties and balls, with their attendant beaux, among whom her slentler, giaceful figure and beautiful dancing made her a favorite.

Miss Kelley nmst have been about nineteen when she went to Lynn, where for several years she had charge of the private school of the Friends' Society. It was while here that she first heard the subject of slavery discussed. She listened to the burning words of William Lloyd Garrison and to the strong Quaker utter- ance of Arnold Buffum. The "inner voice" began to call to her, and she replied by accept- ing the secretaryship of the Lynn Female Anti- slavery Society, just formed. Her own words, taken from the letter to which I have referred, give a vivid picture of the strong impression which the reform had already made upon her.

" From this time I did what I could to carry forward the work, by circulating petitions to tur legislative bodies, scattering our publica- oions, soliciting subscriptions to our journals, and raising funds for oiu- societies, in the mean- time by private conversations enforcing our principles and our measures in season and out of season, taking more and more of the time

left from my scliool duties. At length my whole soul was so filled with the subject that it would not leave me in school hours, and I saw I was giving to this duty less than its due. This decided me to resign. I had been wanting to pass a season with my mother, who was in failing health. My resignation was not ac- cepted, but I persisted, and after two more terms I was released. My mother was in sym- pathy with me on the slavery question, and I told her fully the state of my mind, saying that, but for the fact that I had so little com- mand of language and no training in public speaking, I should think I had a divine call (as understood by Friends) to go forth and lecture.
