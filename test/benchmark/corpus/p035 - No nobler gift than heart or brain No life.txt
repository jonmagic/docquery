Mrs. Lydia H. Smiley, Mrs. Partington's mother, was the daughter of Liberty and Su- sannah Woodcock. Born in Winthrop, Me., March 2, 1804, she died March 25, 1865. Mrs. Partington says of her: "She was a perfect housekeeper and a devoted mother. She be- lieved that children should obey their parents, and not parents obey their children. When I was three years old, she sent me to the infant Sabbath-school. I was given a little card with one verse on it for my lesson. Monday morn- ing I wanted to go out and play with my little playmates, but mother said I nuist get one line of my lesson first. I began to think tliat Sabbath-school was a nuisance, and I replied, 'I'm not going any more.' Mother said, 'Yes, you vill go'; and I knew that I'd have to go.
