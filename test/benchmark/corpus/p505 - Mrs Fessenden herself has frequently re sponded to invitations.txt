Mrs. Fe.ssenden herself has frequently re- sponded to invitations to preach in Congre- gational, Baptist, and Methodist pulpits. When only twelve years old, she united with the Presbyterian church, at a time when young people were rarely admitted to church member- ship.

At present Mrs. Fes.senden is Vice-President of the Massachusetts Woman's Suffrage Asso- ciation, National Lectiwer for the W. C. T. U., and a leailer and teacher of classes in parlia- mentary law. She early found that she could most effectively help the causes in which she was interested by the spoken rather than the written word, and her literary work has been confined to articles on vital subjects and stories for children's magazines. As a speaker, her power to hold audiences is very marked, and

people like Dr. Lorimer, Mary A. Livermore, the late Joseph Cook, and Frances E. Willard have spoken enthusiastically of her aV)ility. She has a fine presence, a melodious voice, a logical mind, and great skill in presenting her argu- ments forcibly.

Joseph Cook praised her "good judgment, good taste, courage, and alertness." Miss Willard said: "It is her good fortune to have something to say and to say it with clearness and conviction, wit and wisdom." Neal Dow said, "There is not within my knowledge a more devoted friend of temperance, nor one whose work on the platform is more acceptable and effective than hers."

CARRO MORRELL CLARK, the only woman publi.sher of note in the coun- try to-day, is a native of Maine. Ten years ago she left the pleasant farm home in the town of Unity, where she was born, aad came to Boston, having no definite purpose beyond a desire to ascertain what chance there was for a girl whose ambitions reached beyond farm life. Her bright, busine.ss-like manner carried her rapidly forward, and she was so successful in her efforts for others that she soon decided to rea]) the full benefit of her energies for herself. Accordingly in 1892 she opened in her own name a book and stationery store in the Back Bay, where her patronage included from the start .some of the most ex- clusive families of Boston. Of this very .success- ful enterpri.se -she was sole owner and man- ager for about nine years.

In September, 1900, Miss Clark organized the C. M. Clark Publishing Company of Boston, of which she is the head. This enterprising house in its first year of existence achievetl the remarkable distinction of producing two works of fiction both of which within one month from their publication were clas.sed among the six best selling books throughout the country. The first was " Quincy Adams Sawyer," a New England story, which came out on November 3, 1900, antl rapidly jumped into the very small class of books selling nearly two hundred thou- sand in less than one year from publication

date; and the second was the famous Aaron Burr romance entitled " Blennerhassett," which was puhhshed on September 6, 1901, with a remarkable record â€” an advance sale of sixty thousand copies before the publication date. In less than one week from the time it ap-^ peared in the bookstores this l)(if)k had Ijecome the best selling one in New York and Boston, and within a month it was in the list of six l)est selling books in the whole country. As Christ- mas apj)roached, "Blennerhassett" was l;eing produced in editions of twenty thousand copies, and the one hundred and twenty-five thousand mark was nearly reached in the almost incredible time of two months.
