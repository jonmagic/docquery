cers came and took the little hand on stretchers to the ambulance train, which was waiting a ([uarter of a mile away. For fear of the mob, gendarmes walked besitle the wounded, antl they reacheil the train in safetj'.

"When the men were made comfortable. Madam asked for food. She declares that the great bowl of oatmeal porridge, thick with prunes, which she received, was the most de- licious meal she has ever eaten. When they reached Berlin, the men were ])laced in a hos- pital, and, thanks to the untiring care of the little American, every one of them recovered."

In recognition of these meritorious services Emperor AVilliam i)re.sented her with the Iron Cross, she and Clara Barton being the only American women to receive that decoration. It is a handsome Maltese cross, of iron with white enamel, the liadge of a Prussian order founded in ISIX for military services, and re- organized in 1870. After her return to her na- tive land the Emperor sent her the Metlal of Merit, which is the highest honor conferred in Germany for bravery in war, and has been given to no other American, it is said. I'n- fortimately, the medal was lost in transmission, hut she received the autograjih letter written by the Emperor when foi'warding the precious gift. During Prince Henry's recent visit to Boston (March, 1902) Mrs. Von Olnhausen, wearing the Iron Cross, was greeteil by him most cordially, he expressing his surprise and delight to see the decoration worn by an Amer- ican woman. " It is a great honor in my coun- try," said he. " Please tell me how you came to receive it." He promised her that upon his return he would see that the Medal of Merit was in her possession, in accordance with his grandfather's wishes. This promise she did not live to see fulfilled. It may be said to have been cancelled by her ileath, which soon followed, April 12, 1902.

The home of Mrs. Von ( )lnhausen in her later years was at the Grundmann Studios, Claren- don Street, Boston, where she enjoyed a quiet life with her embroideiy work and designing. She was young in spirit, and her host of friends always found a cordial welcome.

They observed lier birthdays witli gifts and flowers. She was especially interested in Jap-

anese art. She received numerous orders for her work after the interview with Prince Henry, an account of which was widely published.

Loyal, patriotic, courageous, unselfish, a lover of art and literature, a friend of human- ity, she will he mis.setl by many who enjoyed her friendship and appreciated her worth. Her funeral was held at Mt. Auburn, and was at- tended by the Massachusetts Army Nurse Asso- ciation, of which she was a loved member, and in whose meetings she often participated. The Iron Cross was bei I ueathed l)y Mrs. Von Olnhausen to the Lexington Historical Society. Her life, compiled from her letters antl journals by her nephew, James Phinney Munroe, has recently been published, by l&gt;ittle.
