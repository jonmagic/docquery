Her maternal grandfather was Nathaniel Chapman, who served in the Revolutionary army from 1775 to 1780.

The subject of this sketch very early showed a decided taste for drawing faces. The white wails of the attic, the covers of her school- books, or any surface that would take a mark, was covered by the chiklish fingers with draw- ings in lead-pencil, chalk, or charcoal, which- ever lay nearest to hand. The old proverb, "Necessity is the mother of invention," proved true in her case when, at the age of eight, she cruslied the old-fashioned flowers growing in the garden, that she might thus be enabled to give a semblance of natural coloring to the faces she delighted in. At the age of eighteen it became possible for her to begin the study of art in earnest. Going to Boston, she became a pupil of Mr: George A.

sequently she studied with the late Harry De Merritt Young. She also received art training in Philadelphia and New York. She then opened a studio in Conconl, N.H., where she painted many distinguished people. Her work soon began to attract notice, winning favorable comment from art critics, brother artists, and the general public, whenever exhibited. Since then she has advanced from high to higher planes of achievement, until now she may be saiil to have attained the full maturity of her powers. She prefers to work wholly from life, but her portraits from photographs show the same force of imagination, complete technical mastery of form and color, and deep and sympathetic un- derstanding of her subject. She is absorbed in the personality of the face she is painting, think- ing of it, dreaming over it, and never satisfied until she has transmitted not only the features but the very spirit of her subject to the canvas. She has receivetl several gold medals for the excellence of her work, and numbers among her patrons" some of the most critical people of Boston and New York.

She has exhibited in New York and Spring- field, at the Boston Art Club, the Portland Art Club, Polantl Springs Art Club. One of her best crayons is the free-hand portrait of Maine's distinguished Senator, the Hon. James W. Brad- bury, which elicited much favorable conmient at the World's Fair in 1893. Two of her minia- ture portraits were accepted by the Boston Art Club for its sixty-second exhibition. One of these was of her son Frederick, the other of Mrs. Llewellyn Powers, wife of Governor Powers.
