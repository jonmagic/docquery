After her father's death Eunice was cared for by her maternal grand-parents until she was ten years old, when her mother took for her second husband Samuel Locke, of Hallowell, Me., a man of liberal education, a school pre- ceptor by profession. He had a strong, clear mind, antl exerted an influence on the youthful mind of his stepdaughter for which she was ever grateful.

Thoroughly imbued with the Calvinistic doc- trine by her grandparents, .she became at an early age a prominent member of the Baptist church of Hallowell, her fervid and effective speech making her a religious power unusual for one so young. Her conversion to L^niver- salism was remarkable. Her stepfather was a profound student of the Bible, and he could see naught else in its pages, as he declared, but evi- dences of the supreme and unchangeable love of God, whose divine fatherhood was one with his eternal being. F^unice was deeply ilis- tre.Â«.sed by this condition of her stepfather's mind, and finally prevailed upon her })astor, Mr. Moses, to visit him and bring him to the

orthodox faith. Having brought them to- gether, she sat back and listened with inten.se interest and anxiety. Her account of this in- terview, with the results that followed, given in her diary, presents an epitome of religious experience of the past century in a most inter- esting manner.

The discussion that followed left Eunice in dismay. After Mr. Locke had disposed of the final attack in the consideration of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, which her minister had brought forward with great confidence, "he," we quote from Eunice's diary, "was going to explain further, when the minister's watch came out again, and he said he must go. I asked him to wait a moment and I would accompany him. I could not bear to be left alone, just then, with my father. On our way to the meeting-hou.se we were mostly silent. Not a word was spoken in allusion to the late discu.ssion. Arriving at the vestry, I took my seat with my sisters, and then gave myself up to thought. At this meeting, called for medi- tation and prayer, I was to relate my experience for the last time previous to my bajitism and admission into the church. When I was called upon to speak I arose, and tremblingly (for my heart was painfully wrought upon) asked that my baptism might be suspended (that was the word used); and I further said that I made the request after serious deliberation. An old lady, sitting a few pews from' me, spoke up quickly and excitedly, 'Aha! I guess you have been taught in Master Locke's school since you were with us last.' This remark, so impudently uttered, gave me strength. 'No,' said I, firmly and steadily, 'I have been taught in Christ's school, and I will seek further instruction from the same divine and blessefl source.'

"The minister said not a word: he only bowed actiuiescence. He knew what I meant. I will only add that I went home and sought the instruction of which I had spoken. I .sought it earnestly, humbly, and honestly; and, thank God! very .soon my soul was basking in the full glory of my heavenly Father's boundless and answering love. I had become a Universa- li.st."
