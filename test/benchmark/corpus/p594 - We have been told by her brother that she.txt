"We have been told by her brother that she inherited the missionary spirit from both father and mother, but that her special 'call' came through a sermon [ireached by the late Dr. Alden, her friend. Miss Susan B. Higgins, being led to the same wOrk by the same sermon. "During these days of girlhooti and young womanhooil her spiritual life had kept pace with the intellectual. Sitting under the teach- ing of her beloved pastor. Dr. Albert Plumb, she gave her heart wholly and unreservedly to the Saviour. 'I shall never forget the moment,' she told the writer, one evening in the vestry of the dear old church, ' when His voice called, and I answered. We were singing ' Just as I am without one plea, but that Thy blood was shed for me,' and with my whole heart I cried, '0 Lamb of God, I come.'

" Up to that time she had lived like many another young life, doing 'the duty nearest,' yet with no definite aim for a life-work. 'As if he knew my need,' she told a friend, ' Dr. Plumb preached a sermon right to my soul, from the text, " Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel."

" A young pastor (the Rev. Jutlson Tits- worth) had just been installed as pastor of the First Church. The impressive services seemed to him God's special benediction upon his ministry; and" when, during Mi,ss Stone's farewell words to her own people, she reached forth her hand and called her young sister to herself to give her the right hand of fellowship, as together they promised to give their lives to the saving of souls, there was scarcely a dry eye in the church. The pastor arose, stantling with bowetl head. As he afterward said: 'I felt that I stood on holy ground. I knew .something how Moses felt when in the presence of the burning bush. I knew that God was there.'
