Station boarding-schools are at the station of the resident missionary, and his wife is in charge. Here are the best pupils from all the villages, numbering sometimes even a hundred. Selections from these pass on to the girls' high and training-school at the central station, and also to the high school and normal school, or college for the boys. The theological school completes the equipment.

Not included in the above, we find the Hindu girls' day schools and the Anglo-vernacular day schools for boys, both of which receive pupils who are shut out from the boarding-schools on account of caste, yet are eager for education. Attachments formed in these schools have proved in after years helpful and delightful. Many of the boys pass on into government colleges, and later, becoming officials under the English government, never forget the teaching and influence of the missionary lady who touclu^d their lives in younger tlays.

In October, 1876, in the midst of these ac- tivities added to all that ilevolves upon the missionary himself, Mr. Capron was suddenly called to higher service above. A graduate of Yale College and of Andover Theological Semi- nary and for a number of years principal of the Hopkins Grammar School at Hartford, Conn., before its union with the high school, he was well equipped for his life work. Accurate in business methods, of rare judgment and sym- pathetic nature, he was greatly endeared to his associates. Won by his unfailing kindliness of manner, the Hindu comnumity revered him. He originated and established the Madura Widows' Aid Society, which is a lasting monu- ment.

In 1876 Mrs. Capron removed to the city of Madura to superintend the work for women and girls. Here she remained for ten years, or until her return to America. There were three day schools for Hindu girls, and another was soon added. These four schools provided for nearly four hundred girls of the higher castes a blessed retreat from the aimlessness and ig-

norance of their homes. The government of India provides generously for the education of girls, as the Results Grants yearly examina- tions bring funds to be added to the allowance from America. Three masters and twelve school-mistresses were in charge. In place of a rented, uncomfortable room a new building was provided for one of these schools in the midst of Bralmiin homes. The famous temple covering fourteen and a half acres with its massive architecture and nine pagodas had its band of mvisic for the little goddess within sound of the songs of the girls. Theirs was a sweeter melody, and more stopped to listen than ever gave heed to the noisy bang of the temple performers. High, cool, antl airy, with a court-yard attractive with ferns and creepers, it became a resting-place for the women, who enjoyed seeing the variety of school life. Phillips Brooks, on entering it during his tour in India, surveyed the lines of one hundred girls in their gay clothing and jewels. With a bright smile he said, "And this is a piece of Boston!" So foreign was it to the sights in that great city.
