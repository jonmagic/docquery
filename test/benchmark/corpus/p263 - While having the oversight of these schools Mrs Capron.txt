While having the oversight of these schools, Mrs. Capron felt the claim of the women upon educational effort imperative. No such pro- vision as the Hindu girls' day schools having been made for the mothers in their girlhood days, they wished that they too might learn to read. Hence arose a demand for teachers in the homes. For a woman to be seen going about the streets and entering houses of tho.se not her relations was not consonant with Hindu ideals. There being in those earlier days no suitable women as teachers except those trained in mission schools, these were constrained by the example of the lady missionary to lay aside custom and give their services to those who were so ready to receive, and, having taught the primer, they next gave them the Bible. Since in many homes they read from the Bible to those who did not care to learn, but were glad to listen, they were called Bible wonvm. There were three of these teachers, or readers, and thirty women under instruction. Their number increased to twelve, the number learn- ing to read to nine hundred and fifty. The superintendence of these added to her own

visits in the homes was a work full of interest to Mrs. Capron.

A room in the dispensary was given to Mrs. Capron, where women and children coming for medical treatment might- gather. Coming to India before the days of medical education for women, but having a liking for the work, under the leadership of the enthusiastic Dr. Etlward Chester, she gave two hours each morning to writing such prescriptions as were within her ability. Desiring to add something if possil:)le to render her service in this line more valuable, she spent six weeks in 1875 in the Government Hospital in Madras, where the physician in charge kindly afforded without limitations such advantages as she most de- sired. A woman physician is one of the most potent factors in the emancipation of the women of India from the fetters of superstition and cruelty. "I do not expect to be cured," said a Brahmin woman who had walked three miles, " but I wanted to hear the kind words and feel the pity."

During the fearful famine of 1877-78, when five millions of the people in the Madras Presi- dency and the Deccan perished, Mrs. Capron received for a year and a half a monthly grant from the Mansion House fund, London, for famine relief. The tremendous demand upon one in the midst of such misery must be experienced to be understood. Generous con- tributions from America came as timely allevi- ation to those who long gratefully remembered the ministry.

One day, as Mrs. Cilpron was threading her way in antl out among the bundles of grass brought for sale by the women who were sitting beside them, she overheard one say to another, "Who is she?" "Don't you know?" was the reply, "she is the mother "of the city." Her conveyance and white bullocks had been in every street, and had stood at the head of many a lane. She could always see, in the crowds through which she was passing, recognition if not salutation. She had been often told of the merit she was laying up, with fawning flattery called a (jueen, and that it was a goo(_l deed to bring one more religion to add to the many; but the outspoken testimony of the humble coolie woman was the un-
