Mrs. Cook addressed many gatherings through- out the State, and her elotjuent appeals al- ways commanded attention. Great interest was manifested in all the work. In a general order issued July 13, 1895, she re(|uested corps presidents to fill out an enclosed blank, con- taining a list of questions regarding the intro- duction of a flag salute in th(&gt; public schools. Referring to this line oi work, she said: "At no time since the Civil War has the fact been more apparent that le.ssons of loyalty and love of country should be inculcated in the minds of the children. The members of this Depart- ment nmst realize that a grand opportunity is theirs to carry out one of the principles of our order."

On May 30, 1889, Mrs. Cook delivered a memorial address at Southbridge in the after- noon and one at West Metlway in the evening. Her Memorial Day order to the corps was a heartfelt tribute to the nation's heroes. The following paragi'aph is wortliy of preservation: "As we scatter the chaplets and garlands, fragrant with the sweetness of spring, on the spot of gi'een which covers the mounds of our nation's benefactors, may we open our hearts to the teachings of the hour anil the sacredness of the ceremony, light anew the fires of patri- otism, and renew our ])ledges of life and sacred honor to transmit unsullied to our children

this noble heritage of ours! And, while we meet around these altars of our love, may we give a thought of affection to those far-ofT graves marked with (hat one word, ' Unknown'! Unknown, perhaps, the name; yet he was a soldier of the Union. Unknown, perhaps, his rank, his birthplace, or religion; but known he was a brother who gave his life for freeilom. In this fair land are other graves still for us to aiJinoach with reverence. &lt; )ur sister women, whose love of country was shown in action and whose sympathj" for suffering was stronger than life, while we may not lay our offering of love upon their graves, we can give a tender thought to their memories and strive to make our womanhood as true as theirs. Bring into the day's service the young children, and teach them by our exam|)le, as well as by what is said to them, that we can hold the day sacred. Let them assist in preparing tlie flowers and the wreaths, and make them understand that it is a holy day as well as a holiday, to be kept sacredly. Let every niembei' of our order feel it her especial duty to join in the service of the day."

Mrs. Cook had charge of the delegation to the Thirteenth National Convention, which met in Louisville, Ky., in September, 1895. At the opening session of the convention Mrs. Cook was appointed chairman of the Commit- tee on Appeals, and made an able report. It was she who had the honor of nominating Mrs. Lizabeth A. Turner, of Boston, as a candidate for the office of National President. The No- tional Tribune referred to this effort as "the gem of nominating speeches." Upon return- ing from Louis\ille Mrs. Cook again entered zealously into the work in Massachusetts. In a general order issued November 11 she made an appeal for additional contributions for the Department Relief Fund and also for the Sol- diers' Home. She asked the corps to make " the coming Christmastide one long to be re- membered by sending boxes of clothing and delicacies such as are common to this festive season."
