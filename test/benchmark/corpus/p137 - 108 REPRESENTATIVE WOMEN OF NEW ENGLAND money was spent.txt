money was spent in purchasing a picture which was hung in the gynniasium. The school con- tinued under the new management with unvaried success until the fall of 1900, when the old rooms on Irvington Street were exchanged for new and improved cjuarters at 206 Massachu- setts Avenue. The continued success of the gymnasium is proof of the executive ability of its manager, who for over seven years has carried on the work with such results as to maintain the reputation first established of being one of the leading normal schools of Swedish gymnastics in the country. Every graduate of this school is now occupying a good position.

She has served on various educational conunit- tees, and was first vice-president of the Boston Physical Education Society from 1896 to 1900, when she resigned to accept the office of secre- tary of the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Physical Education.

A NNIE ANDROS HAWLEY, librettist

/\ and musical composer, the wife of X A. George Hawley, was born in Cam- bridge, Mass., being the daughter of Henry Sanford and Adelaide Eleanor (Little) Andros. On her father's side she is descended from the well-known Andros family of Connecti- cut, one of her direct ancestors having been Benjamin Andros, of Norwich, who was prom- inent in State and town affairs about the middle of the eighteenth century.

Mrs. Hawley's musical talent comes by in- heritance from both her parents. Her father, the late Henry Andros, was endowed by nature with a rarely sweet tenor voice, and was, more- over, a thorough musician by education and training. For thirty consecutive years he filled the position of choirmaster of St. Peter's Epis- copal Church in Cambridge, being the incum- bent of that position until within two years of the time of his death, which occurred suddenly in August, 1902.
