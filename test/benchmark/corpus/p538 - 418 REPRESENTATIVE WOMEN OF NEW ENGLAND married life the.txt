married life the past nine years has been divided between New York and Great Britain." (She became the wife of George C. Riggs in 1895.)

Born in Philadelphia, daughter of Robert Noah and Helen E. (Dyer) Smith, she is a grand-daughter of Noah, Jr., and Hannah ( W'heatoii) Smith and of Jones and Lydia (Knight) Dyer, all of Maine in their day, and great-grand-daughter of Noah Smith, Sr., of the South Parish of Reading (now Wakefield), Mass., born in 1775, who was a Captain of cavalry in the State militia. Captain Noah Smith is spoken of by the historian of Reading as a "man of great vivacity, intelligence, and public spirit, remarkable for an inexhaustible fund of witty anecdote and lively story, with large develo])ment of language and mirtlifuliK'.ss. His father was Captain David Sm'itli.

Noah Smith, Jr., son of Captain Noah and his wife Mary, daughter of Paul Sweetser, of Reading, was born in 1800. He settled in Maine, where he became prominent in pul)lic life, serving for a number of years as Speaker of the House in the State Legislature and later as clerk in Congress.

Kate Douglas Smith, the subject of our .sketch, was educated first at her home in Hollis, a small Maine village, then at Gorham Seminary near by, and later at Abbot Academy, An- dover, Mass.

In 1873 the family removed to Santa Bar- bara, Cal., and in 1876, while living in (Cali- fornia, the future chronicler of childhood studied kindergarten methods under Emma Marwedel, and, after teaching in the Santa Barbara College for a year, she organized in San Francisco the first free kindergarten west of the Rocky Mountains. This school, the Silver Street Kindergarten, was in a quarter of the city where squalor and poverty reigned supreme, and it was to the very poor that she began giving liberally her time, energy, and enthusiasm. She .soon saw the need of trained assistants, and in 1880 she organized the Cali- fornia Kindergarten Training School.

After her marriage in the same year to Samuel B. Wiggin, of Sail Francisco, the training school was conducted by her sister, Miss Nora Archi- bald Smith, who had been associated with her in the Silver Street Kindergarten. In 1888

Mrs. Wiggin removed with her husband to New York, where he died in 1889.

Mrs. AMggin, while living as a widow in New York, thnnv herself with great energy into the kindergarten movement in that city, and it was in this interest that she was drawn into the semi-public reading of her own stories. ::; Her first |)uljli.shed story, ''Half-a-dozen Hous(&gt;keep(&gt;rs," written in California when she was eighteen, appeared in St. Nicholas in No- veml)er and December, 1878. "The Story of Patsy," writtim for the l)enefit of the kinder- garten, is said to have reachetl a sale of three thousand copies without the aid of a publisher. The " Birds' Christmas C'arol," whose sale was ec|ually large, has been translated into Jajianese, French, German, Danish, and Swedish, and has been put in raised type for the blind. Among her other books may be mentioned "Polly Oliver's Problem," "A Summer in a Canon," three volumes relating to kindergarten work (of which she was joint author with her sister, Nora A. Smith),' "The Milage Watch-tower," "Timothy's Quest," "A Cathedral Courtship," the three Penelope books, " Diary of a Goose- girl," and "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm."
