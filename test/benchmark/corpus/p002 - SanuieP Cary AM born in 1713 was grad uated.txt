SanuieP Cary, A.M., born in 1713, was grad- uated at Harvard College in 1731. He became a sea-captain, making long voyages. He mar-

ried in 1741 Margaret Graves, daughter of Thomas' Graves, of Charlestown (Harv. Coll. 1703), Judge of the Superior Court; grand- daughter of Dr. Thomas^ Graves (Harv.

Howe. This act of public- spiritetl generosity is commemorated in the name which the school — now in South Boston, marvellously increased in size and eciuipment — bears to this day, "The Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind."
