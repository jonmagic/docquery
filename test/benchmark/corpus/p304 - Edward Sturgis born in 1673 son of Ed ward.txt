Edward^ Sturgis, born in 1673, son of Ed- ward^ and Temperance, married Mehitable Hallet in 1703; and their son Edward* married Thank- ful Hedge, and was father of Edward,'' who married Mary Bassett. The last named coui:)le, with f(nir sons — James, David, Jonathan, and Heman — moved from Bainstable, Mass., to Vassalboro, Me., in 1795. On the ground where they settled were many Indian graves, and often, even to this day, Indian implements are turned up by the plough.

REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN OF NEW ENGLAND

Jonathan" Sturgis was born in November, 1782. His wife Melinda, whose maitlen name was Perkins, is dimly remembered by her grand-daughter, Mrs. Merrill, as being intel- lectual and refined, a gentlewoman of the olden time. She was cousin to the Hon. Reuel Will- iams, of Augusta, the kinship being through the Ingrahams. His maternal grandparents, Jeremiah and Abigail (Hartwell) Ingraham, who were married in Stoughton, Mass., in 1755, and removed to Augusta, Me., were hers also. As their daughter Zilpha, who married Seth Williams, was the mother of Reuel, it may be taken for granted that their daughter Tilly, who married a Mr. Perkins (see History of Augusta, Me.), was the mother of Melinda. Abigail Hartwell, it may be added, was daugh- ter of Joseph' Hartwell, son of SamueP and grandson of William' Hartwell, an early set- tler of Concord, Mass. Elizabeth Hartwell, sister of Abigail, was the wife of Roger Sher- man, the statesman.

The subject of this sketch received her ear- liest education mostly at private schools, and then attended the Augusta High School, where she was graduated. At an early age she showed marked ability as a singer, probably inheriting her love for music from both parents. At first she sang as the birds sing, for pure joy and love of singing. An uncle who played the violin took great interest in her early train- ing, and taught her to read music unaided by an instrument.

At fifteen Miss Randall sang in a church choir in Augusta, and at the same time she began studying with representative teachers in Boston. At nineteen she married Albert Pembroke Merrill, who was connected with the large whotesale lumber house of Moses anil James L. Merrill, of Portland. They took up their abode in Portland. The wetlded life of this young couple was soon blighted, as in less than a year after marriage Mr. Merrill was pronounced a hopeless invalid, and, closely following this calamity, business reverses came, the loss of fortune necessitating removal fro n a lux- urious home and the bearing of heavy burdens. Mrs. Merrill then began singing in church on a salary, first at old St. Luke's, now St. Stephen's, then at Congress Square Church,

where she remained twelve years. The death of Mr. Merrill after an illness of nearly five years was followed some years later by that of her only child, Martha Pitts Merrill, at the age of twelve. Through these and other home trials that came, testing her faith and strength, Mrs. Merrill showed herself steadfast, keeping up her nuisical work as well as caring for the invalids in her family.
