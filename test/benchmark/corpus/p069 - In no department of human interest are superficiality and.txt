In no department of human interest are superficiality and charlatanry more common than in hers, met in men and women who are impatient of the slow progress and long toil that leail to excellence, or are willing to offer highly colored fustian for royal purple. Against both she puts forth a protest which, if not always heeded, is yet widely felt. The stand- ard of public demand has undoubtedly been lifted by her influence. In and about San Francisco charlatanry is less prosperous be- cause she is there. Her art is not her religion, yet, through her utter devotion, represents it. She believes in her art as a ministry to man's higher needs. It is not merely to entertain, but also to instruct and quicken. But these ends are sacrificed if its stantlard is mean. Make it high, make it noble, and it shall be cleansing and uplifting. On this thenic her elo(iuence never tires.

It is, however, on the platform that some

of us like best to think of her. Here she is a radiant figure. Presence, manner, voice, all contribute to an impression that is sometimes wonderful.

She is sometimes spoken of as a public reader, why I know not, for she never reads. She care- fully memorizes her selections, and this all the way from a lyric of Whittier to a drama of Shakespeare. Thus steeping her mind in them, she can not only inter])rct them, but incarnate them. Their humor, piety, passion, pathos, smilfe and aspire and glow and weep in her. She is extremely fond of Browning, has studied him widely and deeply, and in her public reci- tations done not a little to extend his influence. It seems a daring thing to carry Browning to a popular audience, but she has done this re- peatedly with superb success. She has great power of personation, through which the suc- cessful presentation of an elaborate drama lias been with her a frequent achievement. Brown- ing's " Blot in the 'Scutcheon" she has rendered to audiences of three thousand, which she en- thralled. I once heard her render "The Mer- chant of Venice," in herself a whole troupe of dramatic stars. Every feature of the rendering charmed me; but the feature that especially impressed me was the facility with which she transformed herself into the likeness of her vari- ous characters. That Antonio shoukl come be- fore us was not surprising, for he opens the play, and the personation of one character is achievement with which we are familiar; but Salarino and Solanio and Bassanio and Grati- ano were as distinctly there. In the flow of the dialogue so many men could not have pre- served the individuality of these characters more successfully. Afterward, in a group of those who had been present, it was interesting to hear them give judgment as to her better part: it occurred to no one to specify her poorer. To me her more successful personation seemed her Shylock. If there be moral advantage in seeing in vice its own deformity, we received a useful lesson that evening. But there was her Portia, and some were sure that her higher achievement was the personation of her. Others saw the finer stroke in some aspect of her recital of the billing and cooing of Lorenzo and Jessica. Through all, however, it was a
