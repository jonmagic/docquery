"Soon after this I was invited to speak in

Torrington, where a Methodist church was opened to me, the minister being absent. I remained there about a week, holding several meetings, which created great interest, so that people came in from surrounding towns. There were many questions asked and answered, but very little opposition was apparent. At one of the last meetings, though nothing had been said about money, the people in passing out left contril)utions on the desk before me. No one said a word except an aged man, who, dropping a gold coin, remarked, 'The laborer is worthy of his hire.' The amount was sev- eral dollars.

"When I started on my mission, my funds were low. I could not ask for help, but de- cided that, when my supply should fail, it would be sufhcient reason for my going home. At one time I had but ten cents left in my purse, ant! was about to write home for a loan, when a letter from an intimate friend was brought me, containing a five-dollar bill."

Among the iJaces which Miss Kelley visited was Norfolk, Conn. Arriving in the absence of her host, several of the principal men of the town called on her, and informetl her with threats that if she persisted in her attempt it would be at her own peril. With no friend at hand she had to yield; but it was Saturday night, and she could not get away before Mon- day. Her hostess was evidently in sympathy with the mob element, and Miss Kelley there- fore tried to get lodgings at the hotel. She was told that the innkeeper would as willingly entertain the vilest woman from New York as herself. "Language," she writes, "cannot ilescribe that long day and night of spiritual anguish and utter desolation." Monthly morn- ing saw her depart. She went to the house of a friendly Quaker farmer in Canaan. "Once more I breathed freely. A terrible burden fell off me. When left alone I went into the or- chanl back of the house" (remeniber she was still young, only about twenty-five) "and ran about like a colt let loose. I hopped, skipped, and danced. I climbetl the trees and sang with the birds. Such ecstasies of delight come rarely."

In this town she held good meetings, but in Salisbury her meeting was broken up by a

mob which rang the church hell, tooted tin horns, and beat on tin pans.

At Cornwall Bridge Miss Kelley barely es- caped personal injury. The politics of the town were controlled liy a charcoal manufact- urer, a drunken, profane fellow, who had a similar following. "When we entered the house, we found it well filled and lighted, with a candle on the desk, and several candles and oil lamps on the box stove in the centre. The audience appeared respectable; but from with- out smutty faces looked in through the open windows, and ominous mutterings were heard. Directly there strode in a burly, led-faced fellow, with glaring eyes, who brandished a huge club, shouting with an oath, 'Where's the nigger wench?' A shudder ran through me. A feeble, trembling voice in a far corner of the room replied, 'Perhaps she has not come.' Down fell his club, right and left, jKit- ting out and smashing lamps and candles. That on the desk followed in an instant, while I was seized by my friends, and in the dark- ness was hurried to the door, amid the sounds of the falling club, the screams of the wounded, and the horrible oaths of the drunken wretch." Another attempt to hold a meeting was foiled by the appearance of this man with a loaded gun.
