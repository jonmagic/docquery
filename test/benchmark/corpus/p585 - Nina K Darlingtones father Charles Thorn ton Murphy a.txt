Nina K. Darlingtone's father, Charles Thorn- ton Murphy, a resident of Philadelphia, is a great lover of music and art, a composer of ability, and a natural artist. His setting of Oliver Wendell Holmes's battle hymn, " God bless our Flag," fitly illustrates his musical quality. His father, John H. Murphy, fearing, with old-time prejudice, that he would devote his life to music, sent him to sea for five years; but, though separated from his beloved instrument, his musical nature held its own. The father's influence, however, was great enough afterward to induce him to adopt a business career. In his wife, Alice C. Lewis, he found a willing sym- pathizer and ready listener, and thus was woven into the home life their own interpretation of music for the very love of it.

Mr. Murphy's mother, whose maiden name was Saunderson, was a descendant of Robert Carter, of "Corotoman," I^ancaster County, Va., known as "King Carter," who was born about 1663, son of John and Sarah (Ludlow) Carter; the royal descent of "King Carter," and there- fore of his posterity, with a long list of illus- trious progenitors, among them Charlemagne and the Emperor -Frederick Barbarossa, is of undisputed authenticity (see "Ancestry of Ben- jamin Harrison, President of the United States, 1889-93," with included chart, by Charles P. Keith).

Into this musical and intellectual atmosphere came the first-born of eight children, the child Nina, named for a song and destined to bless all good inclination and help others to trust holy heart impulses. As usual with those whose abilities are of an unusual order and

beyond what the world cognizes, she suffered from uncongenial environment; but, though this blighted outward expression, it did not tleter the child's inner growth, even as the careless crushing of a flower does not hinder the ema- nating of the perfume. As the eldest of eight children, she was ever the mother's helper and confidant, sharing in the interest of the home and little ones. When only three years old she saved her smaller sister from falling from a high window, holding on to the child's foot and crying out until some one came to her aid. At the age of ten years she entered the conserv- atory of music at Philadelphia, and for two or three broken years at school enjoyed the ad- vantages of musical education. After two years of boarding-school life ,slie was graduated the first in her class, though she had been a member of it for music study for the last six months only. At home in Philadelphia two years of excellent drill under a well-known master. Professor Henri Schneider, completed her musi- cal training. This shows conclusively that per- severance in the natural development of the musical nature, belonging, as it does, to the deeper, or spiritual, is ever of more value than mere intellectual training.

At fourteen she began to teach music to a cousin, and also to her brothers and sisters, the cousin being older than herself. Thus we see her at an early age beginning life's duties se- riously, earnestly, ever with a fixetl determina- tion to overcome the evil of ignorance with true understanding, and holding to the quiet, inner meditation in lieu of formal instruction from without. She thus discovered that this study alone fits one to give out the true substance worthy the distribution to others. This did not hinder her from entering into all the games of childhood with ready zest, settling disputes with an ab.solute justice that allowed no ques- tion of ulterior motive or of partiality. Lovetl and trusted by her associates, she grew into intimate and lasting friendships, upon which she leaned for the aid and sympathy most es- sential to a loving, confiding nature.
