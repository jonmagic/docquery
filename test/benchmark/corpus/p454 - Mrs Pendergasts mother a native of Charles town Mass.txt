Mrs. Pendergast's mother, a native of Charles- town, Mass., was born July 14, 1832, the daugh- ter of Joshua and Abigail (Thompson) Jones. Her father, Joshua Jones, was born in 1799 in Burlington, being a son of Aaron and Re- becca (Beard) Jones and grandson of Joshua Jones, who was of Woburn in Revolutionary times. Rebecca Beard, wife of Aaron Jones, is said to have been of Scotch descent.

Abigail, wife of Joshua Jones of Charles- town and grandmother of Mrs. Pendergast, was a daughter of Captain Jonathan" Thomp-

son, who was born in Woburn, April 26, 1760, son of SamueP and Abigail (Tidd) Thompson. Samuel,^ born in Woburn, October 30, 1731, was of the fifth generation in descent from James Thompson, of Woburn, who became a member of the church in Charlestown in August, 1633, and in 1640 was one of the thirty- two men who subscribed to the town orders of Woburn, where he settletl. The Thomp- son line of ancestry is: James,' Jonathan,' ' Samuel,"'' Jonathan," .â€¢\l)igail,' Mrs. Pender- gast's maternal grandmotlier, who was born August 23, 1800, and died December 28, 1876. (See "Memorial of James Thompson and his Descendants," by the Rev. Leander Thomp- son, that book being also the authority for the civil and military records of Thompson ances- tors following.)

Samuel Thoiniison, great-great-grandfather of Mrs. Pendergast, was fitted for college be- fore he was seventeen, but on account of his father's sudden death chang'd his plans and retnained at home, the family needing his help. The house on Elm Street, North Woburn, in which he lived, and where he died August 17, 1820, was built by his father about 1-730, and partly rebuilt by himself in 1764. He became a surveyor, and engaged in important surveys in Woburn and in other towns, some of his work being on the Middlesex Canal.

While on the latter survey, he discovered in Wilmington a wild apj)le-trce who.se fruit he named the "Pecker," as the tree showed that woodpeckers abounded in that region. He sub.sequently named this variety of apples "the Thomp.son." Many trees were grafted by Samuel Thompson and his brother Abijah. They gave grafts of the trees to a friend and neighbor. Colonel Loanmii Baldwin, who cul- tivated them with great .success and distributed the fruit far and wide. This, we are told, is the true story of the "Baldwin" ap{)le, formerly the "Thompson," as certified by the monu- ment at Wilmington.

In 1758, during the French and Indian War, Samuel Thomjison held a commission as Lieu- tenant of provincials, and was stationed for a time near Lake George. "On the morning of the 19th of April, 1775, when the alarm was given that the British troops were marching

Innnediately seiz- ing his musket, he hurried to the scene of ac- tion, where he performed heroic service. He brought home a musket taken by his own hands from a British sohUer whom he had wounded in the conflict."
