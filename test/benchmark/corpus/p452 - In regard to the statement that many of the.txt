In regard to the statement that many of the ])oor do not appreciate a bath-tub, but use it as a receptacle for various articles, she says: "None of my tenants neglect their bath-tubs. In the first place, I would not allow it; and, in the second, the tenants show a desire for cleanliness when encouraged in it."

By making the comfort of her tenants her chief object Mrs. Mitchell believes that every other purpose of her business is best served. Then she feels a conscientious obligation to tlo good whenever the occasion offers in the course of her business relations with her tenants. Among the laboring people she has frequent occasion to give a word of advice in season. Gaudy furniture bought on the instalment plan in the home of a poor family (juickly arouses her indignation. She discourages such purchases when she can do so without giving offence. Siie is also opi)osed t(j the practice among many poor families of in- suring its members, as constituting a deplorable leak of their slender rescnu'ces.

Besides caring for dwellings as described, she buys, .sells, and lea.ses estates, and trans- acts insurance business. In former years her business was carried on under the name of E. A. Williams: it is now conducted under that of E. W. Mitchell. -She was married to William Frederick Mitchell, October 15, 1902, in Boston, by the Rev. Henry Martin Saville, of St. Mark's Church, Dorchester.

Mr. Mitchell was born in Auburn, Me., September 2, 1876, son of Almon and Clara (Henderson) Mitchell. His mother was Eng- lish - born. His father, born in AVebster, Me., was son of Hiram Mitchell, who was a land-owner and a man of importance in the district. At the Mitchell homestead were preserved sundry ancestral relics, including a bayonet that saw service in the Revolution. Mr. Mitchell was brought up in Sabattus, Me., receiving his early education in the schools, grammar and high, of the district. In April, 1S90, he obtained employment in the print- ing department of the Hollingsworth &amp; Whitney Company, paper manufacturers. Sub.se(juently he had charge of their stereotyping depart- ment for four years. In the fall and winter seasons of this period he attended evening school. When the late war with Spain began, he enlisted in Jmie, 1898, in the Ignited States Hospital Corps, and went to Fort Myer, Va., arriving there July 5, 1898, and serving in the general hospital for about six months.

Then he accompanied the corps upon the United States transport "Sheridan," by way of the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal, to Manila, in (he Philippines, where he arrived April 7, 1899, soon after the breaking out of the insin-rection of the natives against American control. While there he saw the bombardment of ParaiuKjue and the skirmish known as the battle of Quinguia. He aided in removing the wounded from the field to the "Sheridan" after the last-named action, and subse(iuently shared in attending to their needs; and he went back to Manila with the body of Colonel Stoutenburg, of a Nebraska regiment.
