Edward Dearborn married Susanna Brown, whom he left, when he entered the arn^y, to care for the farm and three small children, the nearest neighbor being ten miles away. Su.sanna Brown was the daughter of Nehemiah and Amy (Longfellow) Brown, of Kensington, N.H., and grand-daughter of Nathan Long- fellow. The last named was probably the Nathan born in 1690, .son of William and Anne (Sewall) Longfellow, of Newbury, Mass., and brother of Stephen, born in 1681, from whom the poet Henry A\'. Longfellow was descended.

Jo.seph Knowlton, Mrs. Dyer's father, was a soldier in the A\'ar of 1S12, and her brother, Jo.sejjh H. Knowlton, in the Civil War. The patriotism of Mrs. Dyer is thus shown to be inh(-rited.

During her infancy hei' parents removed to Concord, N.H., and in lS:i9 they took up their residence in Manchestei', N.H., where for twenty years her father was connected with the Land and Water Company, besides tilling important positions of trust. Up to the ag(&gt; of fourteen h(&gt;r education was gained in private schools. She then went to a boarding-school ii\ Concord, N.H., where she remaineil one year, after which she entered the New Ham])t()n Institute, known at that time as one of the best schools for girls in the country, from which she was grad- uated with honors before the age of eighteen.

Returning to Manchester, she taught in the high school for one year French, EngHsh, Latin, and the higher mathematics. Asso- ciated with her at this school was Miss Caroline C. Johnson, who afterward came to Boston and established a school for girls on Bowdoin Street, which she kept for twenty years. Miss Johnson was a cousin of John G. Whittier. It was with her and her sisters that the jjoet in his later years made his home at Oak Knoll, Danvers.

At this period Miss Knowlton met Mr. Micah Dyer, Jr., then a rising young lawyer of Boston. After a short engagement they were married. May 1, 1851, and took up their residence in Boston. Ten years later they ])urchased the fine estate which for a generation had belonged to the Clapp family, at Upham's Corner, Dor- chester. The house is situated on an elevation, and is surrounded by carefully kej)t lawns, with shade trees, many of which are more than one hundred years old. It is an interesting fact that the first tulip bulbs brought U) America were planted in this garden.

Family duties occupied all of Mrs. Dyer's time during the first ten years of her married life; but as the children grew up — and she was blessed with three, two sons and one daughtei- — she found time for the demands of charitable work. During the Civil War she, with scores of other brave women, did what she could to alleviate the sufferings of the soldiers. An amusing incident recently appeared in the Boston papers, in which Mrs. Dyer figures as having fired a shot in the war — not a bullet shot, however, and, so far from doing any deadly injury, it saved a man's life. \\'hil(&gt; riding in a slow Southern train, she passed in the early morning through a strip of terri- tory picketed by I'nion men. It was a dan- gerous section, and the train was barely creep- ing along. Mrs. Dyer, all alert, was gazing out of the window on the lookout for danger, when she e.spied a soldier asleep at his post, an offence punishable by death if discovered. He had evidently been overcome by fatigue. Could nothhig be done to save him'' She was on her way to one of the hospitals with deli- cacies for the soldiers there. Among the.se were oranges. She seized one, and, with an
