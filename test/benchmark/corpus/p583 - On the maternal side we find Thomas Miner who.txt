On the maternal side we find Thomas Miner, who came to this country about 1630. He joined the church in Charlestown, Mass., in 1632, married Grace Palmer in 1634, and later removed to Stonington, Conn., where he ended his days. His diary shows him to have held almost every office within the gift of his fellow- town.smen. His notes began with the day of the week, day of the year, year of our Lord, and year of creation, not forgetting the mention of leap-year. This diary seems to have been a public ilocument, hence the more valuable. A descendant of one of his twelve children was Governor W. T. Miner, of Connecticut (1855- 57). Captain John Miner, sou of Thomas and a personal friend of Governor Winthrop, was skilletl in the Intlian dialects, and served as in- terpreter. He was for many years Town Clerk of Wootlbury, Conn. His daughter Grace married Samuel Grant, Jr., of Windsor, Conn., in 1688, and thus became an ancestress of Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States.

Charles Miner, the historian of Wyoming and a great-grandfather of Nina K. Darlingtone,

was son of Soth and Ann (Charlton) Miner and a lineal descendant of Thomas, the immigrant. Born in Norwich, C(jnn., in 1780, he migrated to Pennsylvania in 1799, and two or three years later settled in Wilkesbarre. He served in the State Legislature in 1807 and 1808, and he in- troduced many bills that are now on the statute books of that State. During the younger Presi- dent Atlams's administration he was in Con- gress with Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and other noted statesmen, personal letters from each of whom to Mr. Miner are still in the family. The Hon. Charles Miner was a strong anti- slavery man. In January, 1829, he made an eloquent speech in the House of Representa- tives, and presented the first bill advocating measures to bring about the gradual abolition of slaveiy in the District of Cohnnbia. At the conclusion of his speech, as narrated in later tlays by one of the family, Mr. W'ebster followed him into the lobby, and, throwing his arms around him, said, "Mr. Miner, you have kindled a fire that will burn from Maine to Georgia."

Mr. Miner's thought was ever for the good of the community. He was a zealous promoter of public improvements, as railways and canals. He introduced anthracite into many homes, and, in company with two other gentlemen, was the first to ship this hard coal of Wyoming, which hatl been thought of little value, down the Lehigh River to Philadelphia.

Many amusing and curious stories are told of the introiluction of "these black stones," as the people calkxl them. Once they were incredu- lous about their merit as fuel. On one occa- sion several men had worked for hours to make the coal burn, and, finally deciding that the task was impossible, had closed the stove iloor and gone out to dinner, incensed at the waste of time and labor. What was their amaze- ment on returning to find a Ijrilliant fire burn- ing and the room as warm as a day in summer!
