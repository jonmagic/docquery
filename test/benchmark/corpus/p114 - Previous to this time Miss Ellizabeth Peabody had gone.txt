Previous to this time Miss Ellizabeth Peabody had gone to Europe for the purpose of learning more of this system and its true meaning, and she was much pleased when the Baroness in- formed her that Madame Kreige and her daugh- ter had already started for America for the purpose of opening a school there. On the return of Miss Peabody, both she and her sis- ter, Mrs. Horace Mann, rendered all the as- sistance to Madame Kreige and daughter that was in their power, materially aiding the prog- ress of the school and work as a whole.

After a successful course of study Miss Rust was graduated in June. She was in good health and very anxious to put her knowledge of the system into practice. A summer kin- dergarten was offered her, which she accepted, she being one of the first pupils of Madame Kreige to teach.

In the following autunm through her in- structor, Madame Kreige, a fine opportunity to teach a private kindergarten with a large salary was offeretl her in the A\'est, which she accepted. There she was most pleasantly lo- cated, both educationally and socially, and by the many attentions offered her was made at once to feel at home in a strange city. Ac- cess was also given her to the private libraries of the most influential people of the city. The fact of this school being supported by the most influential people was what gave her these advantages.

At the approach of spring Miss Rust, much to her regret, found that the climate did not agree with her, and felt obliged to give up her position and return to Boston. Not long after a lady came to Boston to secure a teacher for a private school near New York. Miss Rust being recommended to her, she was en- gaged for this promising position with more healthful surroundings. Here, also, she gave satisfaction. One of the mothers, a patron, sending three children to the school, was so

pleased that she invited Miss Rust to come to live in her home, for the sake of her soul- ful influence over the children, which she did, and remained through one school year, teaching the older children music on kin- dergarten principles, at the same time that she was holding her position as teacher of the private school. At the close of this school year Miss Rust was invited to visit the family at their summer home on the seashore.

From that place she was called South by her father and mother, to as.sist in the dispo- sition of their property, as her opinion was always desired by them in all matters of busi- ness. She remained South through a part of the summer, until this was accomplislied, the family returning in the autumn to their own house in Boston.

A parent who had heard of Miss Rust tlirough Madame Kreige desired that she should open a private kindergarten at her (Miss Rust's) own house, saying she would secure pupils for her from her own friends, which she did. Miss Rust was extremely happy in this kindergar- ten; she was able to do so much more for the children in her own home. One morning a mother entered, saying she would like to send her children to the school for a half-year, " not expecting them to learn anything," but from selfish motives, as she wished the children kept away from her in the morning, as she was a writer. One morning six or eight weeks later, instead of the maid, the mother came to the kindergarten with the children, offering an apology for the remark she had matle at her first visit, and bringing words of ajiprecia- tion from the father of what the children had voluntarily expressed at home, also asking the favor of coming every morning for the week, to realize what was being done for them and what it all meant. A few weeks after a lengthy arti- cle appeared in the Boston Transcript, written by this mother and relating to Miss Rust's work, then not a year old in Boston. This article was an elucidation of the system from a mother's standpoint, treating not only of the work done l)y tlie children, but of the in- fluence of the kindergartner upon the life of each child, which is the soul of the kindergarten. Instead of the children remaining the half-
