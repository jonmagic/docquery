Educated in Notre Dame Convent, Roxbury, Mass., Mrs. Murray early showed a talent for literary composition, her stories appearing in the early eighties in various magazines and papers under the nom de plume "Annetta."

In late years articles from Mrs. Murray's pen — stories, sketches, and poems, have ap- peared in the Boston Transcript, Herald, Traveler, Post, the Pilot, the National and Donahoe's Magazine, and many out of town papers and other magazines. Mrs. Murra}' has composed many songs.

In 1901 Mrs. Murray was unanimously chosen to serve as president of one of the leading asso- ciations of women in New England — namely, the New England Woman's Press Association, which was formed in 1885 and incorporated in 1890. Its object is "to jiromote acfjuaintance and good fellowship among newspaper women, and to forward by concerted action, through the press, such good objects in .social, philan- thropic, and reformatory lines as may from time to time present themselves." During its existence of eighteen years this association has given receptions to many distinguished people. The "gentlemen's nights," held each year in Feb- ruary, have been notable affairs. A journalists' fund gives aid to "distressed newspaper people, in need of temporary help, whether in or out of the a.ssociation." The two years under Mrs. Murray's administration were years of added prosperity and harmony. The N. E. W. P. A. is a member of the National Federation of Women's Clubs and of the Boston Committee of Council and Co-operation of the State Fed- eration. Its honorary members are Julia Ward Howe, Margaret Deland, Louise Chandler Moul- ton, Harriet Prescott Spofford, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, Mary A. Livermore, and Ednah D. Cheney.

Mrs. Murray was appointed by Mayor Quincy anil re-appointed by Ma3'or Hart as one of the Trustees of the Children's Institutions of Suf- folk Coimty. This position, an unpaid one, makes steady demand upon tim(&gt; and attention, embracing as it does the care of fourteen hun- dred wards in the several divisions of the Chil- dren's Department.

Mrs. Murray is a life nieniber of the New England Women's Club, of the Boston Brown- ing Society, the Boston Business League, and the Boston Women's Press Club.

BERTHA VELLA BORDEN, a recog- nized and efficient leader in Sunday- school work, for nine years previous to her marriage the Primary Secretary of the Massachusetts Interdenominational Sun- day-school Association, is a native of Lynn, being the eldest of the five children born to Joseph Franklin and Emma Frances Vella, both natives of this State.

Her father, Joseph Franklin Vella, of Eng- lish and French descent, died in 1899. He was known throughout the city of Lynn as a business man of sterling integrity, great- heartedness, faithfulness, and charity, being a thorough Christian gentleman.

Her mother, Mrs. Ennna Frances Vella, of English and Scotch descent, a woman of en- ergy, kindliness, and piety, is still living in Lynn.

In 1877, after completing her course of study in the excellent public schools of Lynn, Bertha Vella entered upon a thorough training for the work of a teacher in the State Normal School at Salem. Here she displayed such unusual aptness for object teaching that, although the youngest member of her class, she was chosen by her instructor to represent that part of the graduation exercises in June, 1879.
