Removing from Boston in 1897, Miss Hatch spent the closing years of her life at East Pem- broke, with summers at Onset. Invited by- Susan B. Anthony to ])repare the chapter giving the work of the Ma.ssachusetts National Asso- ciation for the fourth volume of the History of Woman Suffrage from 1884 to 1900, that writing was crowded into her busy life. Many hours each week she passed out of doors, often for whole days riding with an invalid brother, camping out in suitable weather and as late as was comff)rtable. Work in the home garden was not neglected, how&lt;^ver numerous might be other cares, and at all hours of the day she was out of doors, taking a rest from her pen in pulling off dry leaves or picking bouquets for the numerous chiklren who frecjuented the place. She reporteil herself but a few months ago as feeling each year younger than the last.

Though nearing the old age of which many speak as a dreary season, she had no such thoughts, but contemplated many busy years, possibly the happiest of her life, before the coming of the change which is " but crossing, with bated breath and with .set face, a little strip of .sea, to find the loved ones waiting on the shore, more beautiful, more precious, than before."

This change came March 20, 1903.

JUDITH AV. ANDREWS, philanthropist, was born in Fryeburg, Me., April 26, 1826. Her maiclen name was Walker. .Her father, Peter Walker, born at Con- cord, N.H., in 1781, died in that city in 1857. Her mother, Abigail Swan Walker, born at Bethel, Me., in 1787, died in Boston in 1861. At Fryeliurg .\cadeniy, where she was educated, Judith A\'alker carried her studies so far as to qualify her to enter the Junior Class of Dart- mouth College. After her graduation from the academy she taught for several years, both in the academy and in young ladies' schools at York and Kittery. Subsecjuently her brother, Dr. Clement Adams Walker, one of the new school of jihysicians for the insane, having been appointed to take charge of the Boston lAmatic Hospital, established in 1839 as the Boston Insane Hospital, she joined him at that insti- tution, and, although never officially connected therewith, she interested herself in the details of its administration, and by her personal at- tention to the patients endeared herself to them. No better school of training could have been found for the activities to which she has given nuich of her life. P^or more than thirtj' j'ears Dr. Walker, who was the third superin- tendent, succeeding Dr. Charles Stedman and his predecessor, Dr. John S. Butlei-, sus- tained and increased the reputation of the hospital for intelligent and humane treatment of the insane. He was much beloved by his patients.

On January 15, 1857, Miss Walker was mar- ried to General Joseph Andrews, of Salem, a man of generous public spirit, who gave much time and labor to the improvement of the militia system of the Commonwealth both be- fore and during the Civil War. In 1863 he removed with his family to Boston, where he died in 1869, leaving Mrs. Andrews with three little boys to care for and educate. The eldest son, Clement Walker Andrews, A.M., is now librarian of the John Crerar Library (scientific), of Chicago, III.; the second, Horace Davis An- drews, is an expert in mining matters in the West; the youngest, Joseph Andrews, holds a position of trust in the Bank of New York, in New York City.
