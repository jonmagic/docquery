Among her pastels two — one of Dwight Carver, son of State Librarian Carver, and the other of Robert Livingstone, the little son of Rev. William F Livingstone and his wife, Margaret Vere Farrington — stand out promi- nently as representative of her very best work. Another fine piece of work, accurate and strong in character, is her crayon portrait of former President Geiders of the Maine Senate, which hung for a time in the capitol, but which has since been presented to Mr. Geiders by the Senate. In 1900 Mrs. Jones painted in oil the portrait of Governor Powers, which now hangs in the rotunda of the State capitol, and which

has been described as a characteristic and speak- ing likeness.

It is, however, for her exquisite miniature work that Mrs. Jones has won the greatest praise; and it has been said that, if placed side by side with the work of the few really great artists in this line, they would not suffer by comparison. Gifted primarily with artistic talent, she possesses also in a high de- gree the power of concentration and a marvel- lous industry that, united, have compelletl suc- cess. Mrs. Jones is a club woman, being a member of the Koussinoc Chapter D. A. R., of the Augusta China Decorator Club, the Cecilia Club, and the Current Events Club.

The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Jones occurred in Bangor, March 11, 1891. They have one chikl, Frederick Sawtelle Jones, who was born July 6, 1892.

A BBY WILLIAMS MAY, the subject of / \ this sketch, was born in Boston on April L \ 21, 1829, and named for her grand- mother, Abigail Williams May, wife of Samuel May. Her parents were Deacon Samuel J. and Mary (Goddard) May. Her father, who was commonly spoken of as "Deacon May," was of the sixth generation of his family in Massachusetts. The Rev. Sanuiel Joseph May, a noted Unitarian preacher of the last century, was his near relative. Deacon May and his wife were at one time parishioners of the Rev. John Pierpont and later of Theodore Parker, and were devoted advocates of the abolition cause. Mrs. May was prominent among the ladies who hekl tables at the anti- slavery fairs, which were for many years a feature in the social life of Boston. I re- member Abby very well at Parker's meeting. From him I learned something of a European trip which she made in her youth. Her father subsequently told me of her devotion to a motherless niece, whom she reared from infancy.

Miss May had many friendships, but she had also great capacities for public service. She was singularly free from any desire for personal prominence, but her ability of mind and sound- ness of character were recognized in all that she undertook. When the exigencies of the
