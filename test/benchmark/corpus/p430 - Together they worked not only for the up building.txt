Together they worked not only for the up- building of the poor of their own faith, but for the betterment of their city, for State, and for country. Their names are to be found on the boards of State and city institutions and on the membership rolls of nearly every prominent charitable institution of Boston. They were blessed with cultivated and artistic appreciation. Painters and nmsicians found in them generous patrons, and, with the literary men and women of our day, often enjoyed the hospitality of their beautiful home on Commonwealth Av- enue. Not having any children of her own, Mrs. Hecht took to her own heart and hearth- stone five nieces and a nephew, who bear to-day loving testimony to her sympathetic care and wise guidance.

Of a profoundly religious nature and religious training, the holy language that makes "char- ity" synonymous with "justice" readily finds

expression in Mrs. Hecht's life. AVhile very faithful to the claims of blood, here benevolence knows no limit of race, creed, or color. Her days are given up literally to the noble privi- lege of ministering to the needs of others.

In her wisdom she realized that the prog- ress of the world rests upon " the breath of the school-children," and that they in turn influ- ence the parents. The Baroness de Hirsch and Baroness Rothschild both approvetl the plan when Mrs. Hecht presented it to them in Paris in 1896, and both became generous contribu- tors. The citizens of Boston, Jew and non- Jew, recognized the civilizing and Americaniz- ing power vested in this institution, called the Hebrew Industrial School, and also became subscribers. Mr. Hecht served as treasurer, and was a liberal patron, believing that there was no better work than that of helping to make good citizens and home-makers, as the school strives to do.

In the death of her husband, February 24, 1903, Mrs. Hecht was deprived of a compan- ion entirely at one with her in her hopes and aims, anrl it was a loss felt by all who came within the influence of his sweet and
