Sanuiel Thopipson was a Deacon of the Con- gregational church of Woburn nearly thirty- six years. Among other offices which he held was that of parish clerk. Selectman, Represent- ative to the General Court for eight years, and Justice of the Peace more than thirty years. " His character for the strictest in- tegrity was known and appreciated through- out his own and neighboring counties; and, although he was a constant witness of liti- gation, he was universally and em])hati- cally called, by those who knew him, a peace- maker."

His death occurred August 17, 1820. His first wife was Abigail Titld, of Woburn, who died in 176S; his second, Lydia Jones, of Con- cord, who died in 1788; and his third, Esther, widow of Jesse Wyman and daughter of the Rev. Joseph Burbeen, of Wobvu'n.

Jonathan Thompson, although not cjuite fifteen years of age when the alarm of war was sounded April 19, 1775, borrowed a musket, and followed his father and uncle to Concord, taking with him the leaden weights of the scales, which he had moulded into bullets at the shop of a neighbor.

" ( )n his arrival at Concord the more direct fighting was past, and the enemy were just starting on their retreat toward Boston. Notic- ing that the method of annoyance employed by his countrymen was that of gaining the head of the retreating columns by a circuitous route, and then from a favorable position, previously chosen, pouring their shot among the ranks till all had passeil, he did the same. In one of these circuits, to their nmtual sur- prise, he met his father, who at once exclaimed: 'Why, Jonathan, are you here? Well, take care of yourself. Your uncle Dani d has been killed. Be prudent, my son, and take care of yourself.' Father and son then each pur- sued his way. Jonathan foUowetl the retreat-

ing army to Lexington and then to West Cam- bridge, now Arlington, from which place he crossed over to Medford, where, with others, he sought refuge in a barn, reaching home safely early the following morning.

" He subsequently served a campaign as fifer and several more as a private. He was at Ticonderoga and in Arnold's flotilla on Lake Champlain, the vessel during the action there being run ashore to avoid a surrender, and the crew escaping into the neighboring forest, where for three days they dodgeil the Indians and were without food. They at last escaped the pursuit by swimming a river, across which, the day being cold and the Indians having no canoe, their savage pursuers declined to follow them. Jonathan Thompson was subsequently at Stillwater, at Saratoga, at the surrender of Burgoyne, White Plains, etc., serving in the army about three years." During a part of the time he served as drummer. After the Revolution he became Captain of militia, and until his death, November 20, 1836, was famil- iarly called Captain John.

Jonathan" Thompson, Mrs. Pendergast's great-grandfather, married August 9, 1781, Mary, daughter of Deacon Jeduthan'^ Rich- ardson (Thomas,* SamueP^'), of that part of Woburn that is now Winchester.
