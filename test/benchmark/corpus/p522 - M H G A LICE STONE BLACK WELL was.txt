A LICE STONE BLACK WELL was born /\ in Orange, N. J., September 14,. 1S57, L \. the daughter of Henry B. Blackwell and his wife, Lucy Stone. In 1869 her parents moved to Massachusetts. She was fitted for college at Chauncy Hall School in Boston, where sh(! took the Thayer prize for English composition and a special prize for knowledge of Shakespe'are. .She graduated from the Collegeof Liberal Arts of Boston Uni- versity with honors in 1881, and began in the same year to helj) her parents edit the Woman' si Journal. For the last sixteen years she has also edited a small fortnightly paper called the Woman's Column, devoted to e(]ual suffrage. She was largely instrumental in persuading the two branches of the Woman's Suffrage Associa- tion, which had split twenty years before, to reunite in 1889; and she has since been record- ing secretary of the united society, the National American Woman Suffrage Association. She is also chairman of the Executive Committee of the New England Woman Suffrage Asso- ciation and chairman of the Literature Com- mittee of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association. She has been much interested in the Armenian question, has for many years been in the habit of befriending Armenian im- migrants, and is the author of "Armenian Poems," a small volume of verse translatetl from the Armenian. She is also the cotnpiler, with the Rev. Anna H. Shaw and Miss Lucy E. Anthony, of a book of equal rights recitations, "The Yellow Ribbon Speaker." She was for some years Associate National Superintendent of Franchise for the W. C. T. U. She lectures occasionally, and is interested in a number of reforms.

Miss Blackwell inherits much of her mother's tenacity and singleness of purpose. Endowed with a ready wit and retentive memoiy, in legislative hearings for and against suffrage she retains a vivid recollection of all that is said in opposition, and is usually able to turn the weapons of her antagonists against them-

selves. Among the younger advocates of suf- frage she is distinguished for her valuable and acceptable service.

Her compositions were first brought out in Boston after being proiluced as a pastime. Her scope is almost illimitable, comprising songs for kindergarten, hynm settings, piano solos, songs for concert use, and a vast number of patriotic songs. Mrs. Fitz has been an ardent worker for the cause of patriotism.- She has .served the Daughters of the Revolution, C'onunonwealth of Massachusetts, three years as State Historian and two years as Vice-Regent; and on March 17 last she accepted the position of State Regent, Daughters of the Revolution. At the annual convention of the Gf'neral Society in May she was elected first Vice-President-general. Mrs. Fitz places music first in her artistic likings, but has a discriminating taste in literature, as is shown by her choice of words set to nmsic, as well as in her musical sketches which she is often called upon to deliver before clubs.
