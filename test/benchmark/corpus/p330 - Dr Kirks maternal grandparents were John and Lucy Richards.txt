Dr. Kirk's maternal grandparents were John and Lucy Richards (Davies) Stimpson. James Stimpson, who came from England and set- tled on Cowdrey's Hill, in that part of the old town of Reading, Mass., which is now Wake- field, was a physician. He married in 1661 Mary Leffingwell (sometimes spelled Leping- well). From Dr. James Stimpson Dr. Kirk traces her descent through John Stimpson, who married Mary Wadsworth, of Milton, and died in the town in 1732; their .son, Recompense Wadsworth Stimpson, born in Milton in Feb- ruary, 1728, who married Susanna Blodgett in 1759; Charles Stimpson, born in Boston in 1766, who married Eleanor Hall, and was the father of John, above named, whose wife was Lucy R.- Davies.

Eleanor Hall, the wife of Charles Stimpson, was a daughter of Captain Lsaac and Abigail (Cutter) Hall. Her father was son of Andrew and Abigail (Walker) Hall and grandson of John, Jr., and Jemima (Syll) Hall. John Hall, father of John Hall, Jr., came from England with his widowed mother, Mary Hall, who joined the church in Cambridge, Mass., in 1662, and received land from the town. In 1675 John Hall bougiit land in Medford. He mar- ried Elizabeth Green. Jemima Syll, the wife of John Hall, Jr., an;l mother of Andrew Hall, was a daughter of Captain Joseph and .Jemima (Belcher) Syll. Her father, whose name was sometimes spelled Sill, was an ofhcer in King Philip's War. Her mother was a daughter of Andrew Belcher, and as sister of Andrew Belcher, Jr., was aunt to his .son. Governor Jonathan Belcher.

Isaac Hall, of Medford, father of Eleanor, the wife of Charles Stimpson, was an active

patriot during the struggle for American in- dependence. His record, as printed in " Mas- sachusetts Soldiers and Sailors of the Revolu- tionary War," vol. vii., is as follows; "Captain of a CO. in (late) Col. Thomas Gardner's regt., which assembled April 19, 1775; service 5 days; also Captain, same regt., list of officers in said regt. recommended by Committee of Safety to be connnissiQned by Congress; ordered in Provincial Congress, June 2, 1775, that com- missions be delivered to said officers; also Cap- tain, Lt. Col. William Bond's (late Col. Gard- ner's) 37th regt., company return dated Camp Prospect Hill Oct. 6, 1775, represented dis- chargetl Sept. 1775; also Captain, service 4 days; company marched from Medford, by order of Gen. Washington at the time of the taking of Dorchester Heights, March, 1776."

It is related of Captain Hall that the com- pany that he connnanded l)efore the Revo- lution had been formed by himself, and that it was his custom to supplement the meagre pay received by his men from the government by supplies of clothing paid for out of his own pocket.
