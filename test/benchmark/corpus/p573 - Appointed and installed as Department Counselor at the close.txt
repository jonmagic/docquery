Appointed and installed as Department Counselor at the close of this convention, she rendered excellent service during the admin- istration of Mrs. Evans, her successor.

Mrs. Gilman has been a National Aide, a member of committees at National Conven-

tions, and at the convention in Washington, D.C., in 1902, was elected chairman of the National Executive Board.

As chairman of the Executive Committee of Arrangements for the National Conven- tion of 1904 in Boston, she devoted the summer to the work of preparation for this gathering of women, representing a mem- bership of one hundred and fifty thousand. A friend, referring to her qualifications for office, recently wrote : " Mrs. Gilman is a woman of fine executive ability and fearless integrity, patriotic, benevolent, tactful, and broad- minded, in every way a suitable leader for so great an undertaking." She is a member of the Ladies' Aid Association of the Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts. She is a woman of musical accomplishments, a pleasing con- versationalist, and, as a speaker at public gatherings, is always listened to with interest.

Mrs. Gilman was invited by Mrs. Alice M. Goddard, chairman of the Entertainment Com- mittee, to preside at the great camp-fire of the Woman's Relief Corps held in Mechanics' Build- ing on the evening of August 18, 1904. There were more than ten thousand people present on the occasion of this memorable gathering, which was honored by the presence of national and State officials. Mrs. Oilman's gracious manner in presiding added to the interest of this important event in the programme of En- campment Week in Boston.

Associated with Mrs. Gilman in her work for the National Convention was Mrs. Clara H. B. Evans, of Pittsfield, Mass., under whose ad- ministration as Department President in 1903 the preliminary plans were inaugurated. Mrs. Evans, after conducting a successful year's work and proving herself an able leader, travel- ling twenty-five thousand miles in the perform- ance of her duties, was chosen chairman of the General Committee for the National Convention.

Having had charge of the delegation to Cali- fornia the year previous, she was well fitted for the duties of her position.

Among the visitors to Boston during National Encampment Week were many thousand women from all sections of the country, and those from the West and South received a royal welcome from the patriotic women of New England.
