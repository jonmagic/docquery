In a letter to the Journal the president- general, Mrs. Cynthia Westover Alden, writes: " Every week, regularly, your paper comes to Sunshine head(|uarters, and we read it with continued and renewed interest, especially the Sunshine work in your State. I write now to particularly thank you for your kindness, and trust that you are going to continue lik- ing us forever and ever.

"With your energetic president, Mrs. Heald, of Portland, the State is becoming thoroughly organized. In fact, it is the best organized in Sunshine work of any State in the Union. There are now two thousand and sixty-six well-organized Sunshine branches reporting reg- ularly, not counting the many branches that are formed, but sent! in their reports irregu- larly."

Mrs. Heald has incorporated the State of Maine division of the International Sunshine Society, and at this writing a petition to the Legislature for an approjiriation for the ameli- oration of the condition of the cripples in the State is in preparation. Names of men and women of influence have been secured, and it is reasonably hoped that it will succeed. If in the future attention is given these hopeless, helpless sufferers, it will be due to her untiring efforts in their behalf. Through her personal efforts several cripples have already enjoyed the services of a specialist. Her experience ami observation have developed in an unusual degree all that is tender and lovable in her nat- ure. Her (juick sym{)athy with all suffering, hoih physical and mental, renders her minis- trations doubly sweet. Her heart and hands are ready for all appeals for aid: to none is .she indifTerent. She is eminently adapted to be at the head of an organization who.se watch- word is good cheer, for she is of pleasant ad- ilress, and her greeting, even to the stranger, is always warm-hearted and gracious.

when she was four years old, and her early schooling was receivetl in that city. Her musical education began when she was a young girl, and at the age of thirteen she gave prom- ise of being a brilliant pianist. Her taste, however, was for vocal music rather than in- strumental, and, prompted by natural inclina- tion and the possession of a voice of remarka- ble sweetness and purity, she began to take lessons in singing. Mr. Aaron Taylor and Signor Agramonti were her first teachers, and on the advice of the latter she went to Paris, where she studied under Madame Lagrange and with Professor Barbot of the Conserva- toire. Before leaving Paris, Miss Franklin appeared at a concert at the Salle l^.rard, and achieved encouraging success, which was em- phasized by immediate offers of concert en- gagements and for a season of Italian opera. These flattering offers she was, however, obligetl to decline, as she hail made arrangements to go to London. Here she studied with Shake- speare and Alberto Randegger, the latter being so pleased with h&lt;-r voice that he besought her to remain and make a career in EngUyid. But she had been too long absent from American soil, and in her eagerness to return she declined not only this offer but one to join Carl Rosa's English Opera Company. On returning home she took an extended course of study under Madame Rudersdorff for oratorio and the more serious range of classical concert music. Miss Franklin has appeared in the sym- phony concerts of Boston, New York, and Brooklyn, and in classical and other concerts in most of the large cities of the United States. Her work has been under the leadership of such men as Theodore Thomas, Wal* Dam- rosch, Emil Paur, Karlberg, Ilenschei ricke, Nikisch, Tomlins, antl Gilchrist.
