Leander Cahill, Dr. Cahill's father, elder son of Barnaval and Rebecca (Chase) Cahill, was born in 1834. Coming to Massachusetts at twenty-three years of age, a wheelwright and carriage-maker by trade, he lived for a time in Middlesex County and afterward in Boston, where he engaged in the business of carriage- making. Ruth M. Buckman, whom he mar- ried September 12, 1860, was born in Woburn, January 7, 1839, the daughter of Dennis and Ruth Brown (Richard.son) Buckman. Her pa- ternal grandparents were Jacob and I'^lizabeth (Munroe) Buckman, of Lexington, Elizabeth being a daughter of Marrett and Deliverance (Parker) Munroe anil a descendant of William' Munroe, of Lexington (who came, it is said, from Scotland in 1652), and of Thomas' Parker, an early settler of Reading.

Dennis Buckman was brother to the Hon. Bowen Buckman and Willis Buckman. Ruth B. Richardson, his wife, was a daughter of Jesse^ Richardson, a lineal descendant in the fifth generation of Samuel Richardson, one of the three Richardson brothers who were among the founders of the town of Woburn. The line was: Samuel,' ^^ Zechariah,'' Jesse,^ the latter a soldier of the Revolution. Zechariah, born in 1720, married Phebe Wyman, a descendant of Lieutenant John Wyman, of Woburn.

Mrs. Ruth Buckman Cahill was a woman of

character and cultivation, large-hearted and clear-headed. She was the mother of three children. The second child, Annie R., died in infancy; and Frank .\ll)ert, born in 1867, died in 1883. Eliza, the eldest born, was named for her uncle Bowen's wife, who had recently passed away, beloved and lamented. In 1866, when Eliza was four years old, Mr. and Mrs. Cahill removed to East Boston, where she at- tended the public schools till she reached the age of twelve. In 1874, on account of the mother's failing health, the family removed to California. The warm climate proved bene- ficial to Mrs. Cahill, evidently prolonging her life, and they remained there till after her death, which occurred August 24, 1879. In response to her wishes, Mr. Cahill, who was of a kind and loving nature, and remained ever faithful to her memory, returned East to make a home for his children in Boston, where they would be not far from their mother's kinsfolk. Seven years later, his daughter being then es- tablisheil in her profession, he went back to his birthplace, the old homestead in Sackville, N.B., to be with his younger brother, then in failing health. In Sackville he continued to reside till his death, in 1897, cared for tenderly in his last years of invalidism.

While on the Pacific slope, Eliza had con- tinued her studies under private teachers. When she returnetl to Boston, she was seven- teen, and looking forward to a life of u.sefulness. With the memory of her mother as a prime motive power in every noble aspiration and endeavor, she chose an arduous profession. En- tering Boston University School of Medicine in 1883, she received her diploma in 1886. A week before her graduation Dean Talbot of the University called her into his room and said: "Miss Cahill, there is a request before me for a resident physician for the New England Conservatory of Music. You fulfil every de- mand they make of the incumbent save your age." This was very encouraging to an ambi- tious young novitiate. She accepted the posi- tion, and at the end of the first year Dr. Tourjee asked her to sign a five years' contract. She declined, on the ground of wishing to be free to change the scene of her labors if found de- sirable. She ditl, however, remain for fourteen
