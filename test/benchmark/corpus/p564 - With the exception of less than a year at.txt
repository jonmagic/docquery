With the exception of le.ss than a year at Mount Holyoke Seminary, her schools were those of her native village and of Concord, N.H. ; but she has often said that her best edu- cation was had in reaiiing with her mother. Several years of teaching in New Haven, Conn., and Brooklyn, N.Y., followed. In the latter city she made a collection of extracts from the sermons of the Rev. Henry Ward Beechei — a book entitled "Life Thoughts" — which was very popular at home and abroad. Meanwhile she was deeply interested, as she has always been, in national affairs. Upon the day of John Brown's execution her poem, "The Vir- ginia Scaffold," was read at a large meeting in New York City, and its prophecy in the stanza:

" They may hang him on the gibbet; tliey may raise

the victor's cry AVlien they see him darkly swinging lilce a speck

against the sky; Ah I the (lying of a hero that the right may win its

way Is but sowing seed for harvest in a warm and mellow

May! Now his story shall be whispered by the firelight's

evening glow, And in fields of rice and cotton when the hot noon

passe.i slow, Till his name shall be a watchword from Missouri to

the sea, And his planting find its reaping in the Birthday of

the Free I "

has been amply fulfilled. During the war her poems, "Who's Ready?" "Heroes," "The Mississippi," and others, were marked and in- fluential. Her first small volume of verse was published by Hurd &amp; Houghton in 1867. Then came some two years of foreign travel, an outcome of which was "A Russian Journey." Of this book Whittier wrote: "I like it better than ' Eothen.' " Its chapter upon Sebastopol is said to have caused the neglected English ceme- teries there to be cared for as their brave dead deserved. Upon the completion of the railway

to the Pacific, in 1S69, Miss Proctor went with friemls to California, and her letters, "From the Narrows to the Golden Gate," in the Neiv York Independent, were pronounced by many the best account of the continental journey. A second ' collection of her poems was pub- lished by Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co. in 1890, and two years later the same house issued her "Song of the Ancient People," which was in- spired by the "Hemenway Southwestern Ex- pedition." In the Columbian year of 1892 she wrote the poem, "Columbia's Banner," which was read and recited throughout the schools of the country on Columbus Day; and in Septem- ber of that year her song, "Columbia's Em- blem," celebrating the maize as our national fioral emblem, appeared in the Century Maga- zine. This .song has been widely read and sung. As a reviewer said of it, "It has gone straight to the heart of the American people, ... a song which will be more potent than law to give the Intlian corn its representative place in the republic." Most of the year 1897 she spent in Mexico afld South America. In 1899 she wrote the poem, "The Hills are Home," for the first Olil Home Week in New Hampshire, and in 1900 published her New Hampshire verse in a vol- ume entitled "The Mountain Maid."
