George Woodbury Rus.sell, her father, who was born in vSalem, Mass., and was for many years a sea captain, died in California when she was seven years old. His ancestors were men of prominence in the army and navy, and the family was noted for its charitable deeds. Miss Russell remembers accompany- ing her aunt and grandmother to homes of the sick and afflicted, and she was often sent on errands of mercy. Mrs. Abigail Bunker Russell, the mother above named, was born in Beverly, Mass. She also was descended from a family interested in charitable works. Miss Russell's grandfather Bunker was a gunner in the navy during the Revolution, and her great-grandfather was' the owner of the farm in Cliarlestown on which Bunker

Hill is situated. His wife was one of the Breed family whose farm joined that of the elder Bunker. Their fiekls, inclutling the memorable Breeil's Hill, were the scenes of sanguinary strife in those dark days.

Miss Russell, in referring to her aunt under whose care she was placed when an infant, says: "She eventually proved her worth as mother and friend. Blessed remembiance of that dear soul, whose noble Christian life was one long sacrifice for others, was an in- centive to me to imitate her exam[)le. The tenacity with which she clung to her friends was a marked trait in her character, she being always a sunbeam in their presence. Her cheerful, warm-hearted greeting, her unselfish deeds of kindness, her tender interest in the welfare of her friends, her hopeful si)irit, and unassuming and sustaining religious faith and Christian life will ever be remem- bered by all who were brought in contact with her."

With the exception of three years of public school life, Miss Russell received her education in private schools, completing it in Phila- delphia in 1871. The following year she entered the pension ofhce in Boston, and served under the administrations of Dr. Phelps, the Hon. D. W. Gooch, and General B. F. Peach. Plfteen years of that time she was chief clerk of the Pension Bureau. In 1898 she entered the service of the Prison Com- missioners at the State House as Miss Frye's successor. In continuing the work as Agent for Discharged Female Prisoners she has aimed to instil into the minds of unfortunate women the necessity of being self-respecting and self- supjjorting.

In her first report to the Board of Commis- sioners she said: â€”

"On January 20, 1898, Miss Sarah Kllen Frye closed her labors for discharged prisoners. For weeks prior to that time her failing strength had demanded rest, which her energy and devotion to her work forbade. On that day, however, she became seriously ill, and on the fourth day of March the end came. As her successor, I fully appreciate her labor of love, and realize through personal experi- ence the responsibility and immensity of her

work. Four hundred and thirty-nine women have been furnished with work since February 9, 1898. Contrary to the usual custom of giving office fees, which is often a source of temptation, I go with them to the employ- ment bureau, or previously arrange for them, so that no money shall pass through their hands. Many letters have been written to hotels and private homes for positions for these women, thus saving many office fees. After a home or work has been provided, the interest does not cease here, as visits are made at their homes as far as practicable, a corres]&gt;ontlence is kept up with a large number, and it is found that the attention is not wholly lost, for many appreciative letters are returned to the office.
