In this last sentence is revealed the secret of their power. Neither of the sisters could ever be satisfied simply to impart instruction. The ethical has been the dominant note in their teaching. Their aim is to provide "a home life which shall secure the development of true womanhood." As one means to this end they have secured as lecturers at the school from year to year men and women who are eminent in various walks of life, and who, in particular, are exponents of the finest Christian ideals. Among re])resentative women they have ha&lt;l Julia Ward Howe, Mary A. Livermore, Amelia Quinton, Lillian Nordica, Mary E. Wilkins, Amelia E. Barr, and Pundita Ramabai. The list of lecturers of the other sex includes many prominent clergymen, artists, and authors.

The Home and Day School of the Misses Gilman stands to-day as a witness to the value of jjersonaiity as a factor in the education of youth. With the old Phrygian philosopher, ]']pictetus, these women have felt that " the formation of the spirit and character must be our real concern," and this is the basic prin- ciple of their school. Its success demonstrates the truth of Emerson's words: "In my dealing with .my child, my Latin and my Greek, my accomplishments and my money, stead me nothing ; but as much soul as I have avails."

HARRIETTE J. COOKE, superintend- ent of Medical Mission, 36 Hull Street, Boston, Mass., is a native of New Hampshire. She was born in the town of Sandwich, Carroll County, in the central part of the State, December 1, 1829, daughter of Josiah and Jane (Cox) Cooke.

Harriette Cooke early imbibed the belief that a thorough education was the greatest of helps to a life of usefulness. As there were no colleges open to women in those days, she was obliged to gather what learning she could from the various schools and seminaries accessible to her and from private instruction. In 1853 she was graduated at the New Hamp- shire Conference Seminary, now Tilton Sem- inary. After a few years of successful teaching in Massachusetts she accepted a position as teacher in Cornell College, Mount Vernon, Iowa, which she entered in November, 1857, its opening year. She was then a young woman, possessing an ambition to excel in whatever she undertook to do. Her charac- ter was well adapted to pioneer educational work, having in it the decidedly marked combination of strength and tender womanly sympathy. She was fully up to the times as regarded methods of instruction and mental discipline.

She had especially had stampetl on her soul — as if by divine impress — a desire to assist in the higher education of woman. A profound conviction that only by intellectual and moral culture can the world be raised from the degrading influences of ignorance, and that this end can be best attained through the home by the elevation of woman, rendered her conscious of the importance of her high calling. She thus brought to her new field of labor an enthusiasm which was immediately recognized. Being unusually rigid in her re- quirements of work from her pupils, she gained a reputation for over-exactness that for a time was not altogether conducive to mere
