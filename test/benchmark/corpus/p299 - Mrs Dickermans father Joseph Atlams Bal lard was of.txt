Mrs. Dickerman's father, Joseph Atlams Bal- lard, was of Dutch blood on the paternal side. His father, Peter Albertus Von Hagen, came to Boston to teach music, and was organist of Trinity Church for many years. He married Miss Lucy Ballard in ISOO. The ^'on Hagen children by act of Legislature took their mother's maiden name, Ballard, Jo.seph H. Von Hagen becoming Joseph Adams liallard. Mr. Ballard's ancestors on the maternal side were New England jieojile, residents for a num- ber of generations in Btiston and vicinity. The house in which his grandmother, .Madam Lucy Adams, lived, as the wife and afterward the widow of Abijah Adams, her secoiul husband, is still standing on Pinckney Street.

Joseph A. Ballard up to the time of his death, October 1, 1858, at the age of fifty-one years, was marine editor of the Boston Dnily Advertif^er, associated with the Hon. Nathan Hale, father of the Rev. Dr. Edward P^verett Hale.

Mr. Ballard's wife, Mrs. Dickerman's mother, whose maiden name was Sarah Davis Cowdin Gamage, died July 4, 1874. She was a tlaughter of Nathaniel and Sarah Davis (Cowdin) CJamage and grand-daughter of Daniel Cowdin and his wife, Zebiah Davis, above named. Mrs. Bal- lard was early interested in philanthropic work. She joined the Rev. Charles Francis Barnard in organizing the Warren Street Chapel, a chil- dren's church, and devoted many years to this and other charitable institutions.

Sarah Ann Preston Ballard, now Mrs. Dick- erman, was born June 13, 1833. She was edu-

cated in the Boston public schools, being for some years a pupil in the old Franklin School. She was married February 16, 1853, to Henry Wilson Dickerman, son of Ezekiel and Marinda Dickerman, of Stoughton, Mass. Two sons were born to Mr. and Mrs. Dickerman in the early years of their wedded life, namely: Joseph Henry, February 8, 1854; and William .Mont- gomery, who died soon after his birth, April 10, 1855.

In her girlhood Mrs. Dickerman was much influenced by the Rev. Charles Francis Barnard, and in early womanhood she came under the ministry of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, with whom she formed a friendship which has been unbroken. This training determined her choice of occupation outside of family claims. She has always chosen to join societies having for their objects the advancement of humanitarian ideas or the alleviation of some form of suffer- ing.

She .seems to have been a born suffragist, as from early girlhood she rebelletl at any form of injustice to women, and, although descended from most conservative ancestors, was always ready to work for suffrage for women, serv- ing on the Ward ami City Committee of Women Voters in Boston with .\bby W. May, Ednah D. Cheney, Lucia M. Peabody, Dr. Salome Merritt, and other pioneers in this work. She has voted for school committee ever since women were granted the right to do so, and her interest in school n)atters still continues.

She has worked in the following named so- cieties, serving most of them as either presi- dent, secretary, treasurer, director, or trustee: Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, Massachusetts School Suffrage Association, Jamaica Plain School Suffrage Association, Woman's Charity Club, Martha and Mary Lend-a-Hand Club, Moral Education Associa- tion, Barnard Memorial A.=sociation, Franklin School Association, Children's Mission to the Children of the Destitute, Committee of Council and Co-operation, Ladies' Physiological In- stitute, Jamaica Plain Friendly Society, New England Helping Hand Society, Jamaica Plain Woman's Alliance, Daughters of the American Rpvolutitm, and Animal Rescue League.
