Mary Susan Goldthwait (Mrs. Goodale) re- ceived her early education in the public schools of Boston, and finished her course of study in Medford schools, her parents having removed to that city in 1854. The lessons of loyalty taught her by a patriotic -father were deeply impres.sed upon her mind. Although only a school-girl when the Civil War began, she was interestetl in the sokliers, and solicited money with which she furnished a Thanksgiving din- ner to their families in her neighborhood. On January 7, 1868, she was married to Captain George L. Goodale.

Mrs. Goodale is a charter member of S. C. Lawrence Relief Corps, No. 5, of Medford, which was instituted May 27, 1879. She .served that year as senior vice-president, was installed as president January, 1880, and re- elected three successive years. At the annual convention of the Department of Massachu- setts, W. R. C, in 1881, she proved very effi- cient in committee work, and when the board of directors of the Department met in April, 1881, she was cho.sen a member of the commit- tee on the SoUliers' Home Bazaar, which was held in Mechanics' Building, Boston, in De- cember, 1881. Mrs. Goodale was secretary of the Union table.

She was chosen by the board of directors of the Department W. R. C. to fill a vacancy in the office of Department Conductor in the latter part of 1881, was re-elected to the office at the annual convention in 1882, and a year later was elected senior vice-president. Mrs. (ioodale was cho.sen Department president in January, 1884. During the first year of her ad-

ministration she instituted sixteen corps. She was unanimously re-elected Department presi- dent at the annual convention in 1885, during which year over one thousand members and sixteen corps were adiled to the roster.

In her address to the next convention -(Janu- ary, 1885) she said: â€”

"I cannot give you full particulars of my labors during the year, but will briefly say that I have represented the Department on seventy- three difTerent occasions, written six hundred and thirty-eight letters and a large number of postal cards, travelled over nineteen hundred miles (not inchuling the weekly trips to head- quarters on Wednesdays).

"The work of the Department has assumed such proportions that I am led to reconunend that this convention adopt measures for the appointment of a corps of aides, corresponding to the aides appointeil by the Department con- vention of the Grand Army of the Republic. It would be the duty of the.se aides to become thoroughly acquainteil with all the workings of the order, holding them.selves in readiness to act in any capacity."

This system of assigning s{)ecial duties to Department aides has since been adojjted in ail the States and also by the National W. R. C.

A gold watch, suitably inscribed, was pre- sented to Mrs. Goodale upon her retirement from the presidency.

Mrs. Goodale has participated in national conventions, servetl on special committees by appointment of the national presiilent, and represented Massachusetts one year as national corresponding .secretary. She served as chair- man of the Department table in the Soldiers' Home Carnival, the proceeds of which netted four thousand dollars to the carnival treasury. She rendered efficient service in the kettledrum given under the auspices of the Ladies' Aid Association of the Soldiers' Home, and for sev- eral years has served as a member of the Com- mittee on Department W. R. C. Rooms at the home. From 1893 to 1899 Mrs. Goodale was secretary of the Memorial P'und Conmiittee, having charge of the work for soldiers' widows and arm}' nurses. Since 1899 she has .served continuously as chairman of the Department Relief Coirmiittee. This is a position of re-
