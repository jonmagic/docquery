A sketch of Mrs. Upham's work would be incomplete without reference to her poems and carols, many of the latter, written years ago, still being sung animally, notwithstanding the new ones offered every season.

Two short poems are given below, and many will recall the tender beauty of " Question- ings," which appeared originally in the Boston Transcript, but which was widely copied and appreciated.

The Memorial Day poem has appealed to comrades' hearts all over the countrv: —

ROSES, LILIES, AND FORGET-ME-NOTS.

Roses (Lancaster), red War

Lilies Purity

Forget-me-nots Enduring Memories

Halt!

Comrades, bow with uncovered head, And deem it not weakness to shed

Tears o'er his grave. Strew flowers with Memory's hand, Float o'er him the flag of our land He died to save.

The red fnr the hloa/l he shed,

The vhite for his sotd so pure, The blue for the s/,// n'erhead.

Where his name slioll ai/e embire.

lie was only a .stripling, young. But ne'er hath the poet sung

Of one so brave. In the carnage of shot and shell, With the broken staff, he fell,

And found a grave.

Oh, then, scatter ye roses red. Red, red as the blood he .shed.

And lilies white. "Weave in the forget-me-not's hue, A garland, red, white, and blue, —

Our emblem bright.

The red fur the bhrnd he sheil.

The irhite for his soul so pure, The blue for the sl'ij overhead,

Where his name shall aye endure.

Nothing could be more finished or spirited than the few comprehensive lines to John Boyle O'Reilly:—

In fflcmoriam.

JOHN BOYLE O'REILLY. August, 1891 — August, 1894.

(Written for The Catholic World.)

Patriot and Poet! Martyr! Exile

From out a land that should have owned thee king!

Disciple of thy Lord in suffering! Like Him, a ransom paid, that thy green isle Might burst its bondage chains and live to smile

In Freedom's sunlight. Sadly we do bring

To-day the shamrock's drooping leaf , and sing, — Not as of yore, when thou wert here the while, As knight and leader of the Muses' choir:

The harp of P^rin plays sad discords now, And we, too, chant a requiem for thee. O Jubilate! Nay, we'll tune the lyre

To wild rejoicing, and to Wisdom bow! No fetters bind thy soul on either sea!
