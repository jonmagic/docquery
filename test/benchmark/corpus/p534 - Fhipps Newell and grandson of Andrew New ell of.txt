(Fhipps) Newell and grandson of Andrew New- ell, of Sherborn, Mass., who was born in Charles- town in 1729, son of An(h-ew Newell, Sr.

Polly, wife of Thomas Newell, was a daugh- ter of Jedediah^ Phipjis and great-grand-daugh- ter of John' Phipps, of Wrenthani, nephew and adopted son of Sir Willianr Phipps (James'), colonial Governor of Massachusetts.

Benjamin Whipple, above mentioned, was a man of progressive and lilx-ral thouglit, of remarkalile aliility and intelligence. He was prominent in public life, serving several years in the Legislature and in almost every office in the town government, at one time head of the fire department, and many years a popular connnander of the Charlestown Light Infantry and hence known as Captain Whipple. He served eighteen years as inspector of tlie Boston Custom House. He belonged, it is said, to the old Massachusetts family of this name from which sprang General \Mlliam Whipple, a na- tive of Kittery, Me., one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Captain Whip- ple's wife, Catherine Coats, whom he married in Boston in July, ISOl, was an amiable woman antl one in whom the poor and needy always found a friend. Miss Newell's mother was the second of the seven children of Benjamin and Catherine Whipple. Fond of Ixjoks and study from her early childhood, she was sent to the acatlemy in Derry, N.H., then under the charge of the now famous Mary Lyon. She began teaching school at the age of sixteen, antl for twelve years was considered one of the best teachers in Charlestown and vicinity. She was always studious and progressive. In all her trials of after years, and they were oiany, she showed her courage and Christian spirit in the sweetness with which she met them. She was to every one who came within her in- fluence a woman of unusual magnetism, a mother of mothers.

Captain Newell was a man of energy and ability. In 1846, having received a commission from King Kamahamaha III. to build a schooner for business purposes, he sailed around Cape Horn to the Hawaiian Islands, only to return to build another, the king offering him good business and citizenship of the place. This he accepted, and with his family sailed to

those far-away islantls. This was in the days of rare conununication, and the isolation was complete. In 1848 and 1S49 the excitement became intense over the gold discoveries in California, and Captain Newell was the first to bring the news, as his vessel several years after was the first to go to Australia with j)as- sengers and freight from San Francisco. The Hawaiian Islands, at this time (middle of the nineteenth century) so far away from civiliza- tion, ])resented much that was novel and in- teresting, besides being the theatre of many exciting events. It was an ideal home for children, but lacking in educational advan- tages. A school called the Royal School was finally opened, and into it were gathered dark and white chiefs and chiefes.ses. For playmate and schoolmate Liliuokalani (now the ex- queen) was the favorite of the Newell children.
